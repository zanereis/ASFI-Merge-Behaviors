PR fixes an issue of the IterMapRewriter. Prior to this PR, the mutation function of the rewriter class returns the mutation results even when an invalid PrimExpr pattern was detected.\r\n\r\nReturning the mutation results when failure is not expected, and in such cases we should \"abort\" the mutation, and return the input PrimExpr which is not mutated, since insisting on returning the mutation results sometimes it incurs further error on other arith components like simplification.\r\n\r\nOne unit test is added to ensure the rewriter behaves as expectation.","created_at":"2023-09-06T02:08:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T11:33:19Z","closed_at":"2023-09-06T11:33:19Z","merged_at":"2023-09-06T11:33:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e6e2b35aec23146dc4232bb9887207aa70f52de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5f9d3756f758186718e0d2893f477a83812f6ec2","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-09-05-itermap-rewriter","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-09-05-itermap-rewriter","sha":"5f9d3756f758186718e0d2893f477a83812f6ec2","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

commit introduces a new container, `Variant`, which is analogous to the `std::variant` introduced in C++17, the `enum` in Rust, or a tagged union in C.  The `Variant` class is templated over the types that it may contain (e.g. `Variant<String, Expr>`), where each type is a distinct option that can be stored within the container.\r\n\r\n`Variant` is implemented as a subclass of `ObjectRef` with no additional data members, similar to the implementation of `Optional<T>`.  It can be constructed from any of its contained types, and the contents can be inspected using the usual `my_object.as<T>()` and `Downcast<T>(my_object)` methods.  This is intended to allow for drop-in replacement of `ObjectRef` with `Variant<Type1, Type2, ...>` in places that previously used a common base class.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that each variant can be uniquely retrieved, no type stored within the variant may inherit from any other type within the variant.  This condition is checked at compile-time, with a `static_assert` explaining the limitation.  This condition is necessary to mimic the semantics of `std::variant`, whose active member depends on the compile-time type of an object.  Without this condition, the expression `Variant<PrimExpr, tir::Var> variant = PrimExpr(...)` could populate either of the variants depending on the run-time type of an object.  Because the `Variant` class is primarily intended for use when two types do not already inherit from each other, this limitation is not expected to limit its utility.\r\n\r\nThere are several locations within the TVM codebase where this pattern may be useful, and which are currently worked around various strategies.  (This PR does not alter any existing implementations, instead introducing the `Variant` container that can be used in subsequent PRs, if desired.)\r\n\r\n* Workaround: Store a common base class.  For example, the type of `relax::TensorStructInfoNode::shape` is `Optional<Expr>`, with a comment stating that it should be only `NullOpt`, `ShapeExpr`, or `Var`.  However, these restrictions are not checked by the compiler, and a developer could erroneously provide a different type.  By expressing the type as as `Optional<Variant<Var,ShapeExpr>>`, these errors could be automatically caught.\r\n\r\n* Workaround: Use additional data structures.  For example, a `PrimFunc` parameter may be either a TIR primitive, which is lowered to a primitive type, or a TIR Buffer, which is lowered to a `DLTensor*` argument and appropriate unpacking code.  However, these two types are represented as an `Array<tir::Var>` and a `Map<tir::Var, tir::Buffer>`, which together represent a `Array<Variant<tir::Var, tir::Buffer>>`.  The separate data structures must be kept in sync whenever modified, such as when removing a parameter.\r\n\r\n* Workaround: Use `std::variant`.  For example, the `tvm::tir::IdentifyMemCpyImpl` utility function returns a `std::variant` with the result or an error message.  However, this is only suitable for use within a C++ implementation, and requires a wrapper in order to expose it to the FFI.","created_at":"2023-09-05T14:39:59Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T22:01:26Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T21:56:22Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T21:56:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"24847c55151825ebf4c655cb2e3c5c09c61b48c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/eb465caecb9816c075f0a32fdce0cbe7a1f9790f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:variant_container","ref":"variant_container","sha":"eb465caecb9816c075f0a32fdce0cbe7a1f9790f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

a module with imported modules is exported into a shared library, the imported modules are serialized and embedded inside of that library. This is done by generating a raw binary from the imported modules, which is then assigned to a symbol `__tvm_dev_mblob` in the final shared library.\r\n\r\nThe way it happens for targets that are not \"llvm\", is by creating a C source file, and defining a statically-initialized array `__tvm_dev_mblob` in it. The static initializer is the byte-by-byte hexadecimal representation of the serialized modules. While working with Hexagon, this has presented us with two issues:\r\n1. For most models, the embedded data is very large, taking significant amout of time to compile the auto-generated C source.\r\n2. There are some models for which the C source size has exceeded clang's limits on the size of the input file, making it impossible to export the corresponding module.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to provide a custom serialization routine to `Module.export_library`. We then apply it in Hexagon to build the ELF object file with `__tvm_dev_mblob` by using the objcopy tool from the Hexagon toolchain. This bypasses the C compilation altogether, avoiding both of the issues.\r\n\r\nUsing the same custom mechanism, similar method can be implemented for many other targets which have utilities to manipulate object files

the optimization from `floordiv(floormod(..))` to `floormod(floordiv(..))` do not check the divisibility.

The change add a default handling and let it just fail in followup validity checks.\r\n\r\nFor example, ` (x % 255) // 16` should not get transformed to `(x // 16) % 15`. The change make it as `(x % 255) // 16 % ceildiv(255, 16)`.\r\n\r\nIt currently could not pass the surjective check though the mapping actually is surjective.

PR introduces `nn.MultiLinear` as an extension to `nn.Linear` which is arithmetically equivalent to applying multiple `nn.Linear` to the same input.\r\n\r\nFor example, QKV projection in attention, represented in `nn.Linear` being:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nq_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, ...)\r\nk_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, ...)\r\nv_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, ...)\r\n\r\nq = q_proj(x)\r\nk = k_proj(x)\r\nv = v_proj(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be simplified using `nn.MultiLinear` as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nqkv_proj = nn.MultiLinear((hidden_dim, hidden_dim, hidden_dim), ...)\r\nq, k, v = qkv_proj(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe underlying implementation, by default, will fuse all the projection matrices into a single one, to allow potentially larger room for

PR introduces `ShardLoader`, an object that allows convenient\r\nsharding of each parameter, assuming there is a single shard dimension\r\nand the sharding strategy is even. The sharding can be performed\r\nefficiently on device (e.g. CUDA) and scattered to each worker with\r\nNCCL support.\r\n\r\nThe shard loading process could be further compiled to Relax IRModule\r\nto be executed by each worker with the function signature below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef main(loader: R.Object) -> R.Tuple(\r\n  R.Tensor((64, 64), \"float32\"),\r\n  R.Tensor((16, 128),

Legalize pass was unnecessarily padding the input channels for conv2d int8 native implementations. Since the conv2d schedule itself can add padding more efficiently, I skipped padding during the pass and further optimised the schedule to deal with it.  \r\nI also added a test to check whether or not the Legalize pass pads the conv2d input data.  \r\n\r\nThe benchmark results of a single int8 conv2d operation where input padding along the K axis is necessary, with input = (1 x 224 x 224 x 3), filter = (16 x 3 x 3 x 3), output = (1 x 112 x 112 x 16), tested for the following target `\"llvm --device=arm_cpu --mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu -mattr=+v8.2a,+dotprod\"` , before and after the changes,

steps:\r\nM0.1: Passes for set name and layout for expressions (src/contrib/msc/transform)\r\nM0.2: MSCGraph core (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph && python/tvm/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph)\r\nM0.3: MSCGraph Builder (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph_builder)\r\nM0.4: Codegen (src/contrib/msc/core/codegen, src/contrib/msc/framework/tvm/codegen)\r\nM0.5: Translation test (relax/relay test && related helper modules in python)\r\n\r\nCodeGen is used to translate MSCGraph to relax. To use the relay-based features, I also enable the relay -> MSCGraph -> relax process. In this way relay can be translated to relax without loss information. This maybe useful for developers who build their features base on relay, for example using the tensorflow or mxnet frontend with relax.\r\n\r\nAs relax will be used as the main IR for tvm, support for relay in MSC is very limited. The compression algorithms will be implemented based on relax.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

PR introduces object support in TVM RPC protocol by introducing three new interfaces in `rpc_reference.h`:\r\n- `uint64_t GetObjectBytes(Object* obj)`, which is a required implementation that returns the length of the object during serialization;\r\n- `void WriteObject(Object* obj)` used to serialize an object to a writable channel;\r\n- `void ReadObject(int* type_code, TVMValue* value)`, which deserializes a TVM Object from a channel.\r\n\r\nTo serialize an object, a recommended paradigm is to write its `type_index` first, and then its content. For example, `ShapeTuple` can be serialized as:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n// pseudocode\r\nvoid WriteObject(Object* obj) {\r\n  if (obj is ShapeTuple) {\r\n    this->Write<uint32_t>(type_index of ShapeTuple);\r\n    this->Write<int32_t>(obj->ndim);\r\n    this->WriteArray<int64_t>(obj->shape);\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw Unsupported;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nuint64_t GetObjectBytes(Object* obj) {\r\n  uint64_t result = 0;\r\n  if (obj is ShapeTuple) {\r\n    result += sizeof(uint32_t); # for `type_index`\r\n    result += sizeof(int32_t);  # for `ndim`\r\n    result += sizeof(int64_t) * obj->ndim; # for content of the shape\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw Unsupported;\r\n  }\r\n  return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo deserialize an object, similar to serialization, the recommended approach paradigm is to read `type_index` and disptch based on it.\r\n\r\nCaveat on deserialization: RPC Reference itself does not own or allocate any memory to store objects, meaning extra logic is usually required in `ReadObject` to keep their liveness.","created_at":"2023-08-27T18:12:27Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T03:43:33Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T03:43:33Z","merged_at":"2023-08-28T03:43:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"6554e2e082cf9d3ecf867fcd81b1b6d483df46a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/25e6c1228650e422793b489ce30de8d4b61959c7","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-08-27/objects-in-rpc","ref":"feature/2023-08-27/objects-in-rpc","sha":"25e6c1228650e422793b489ce30de8d4b61959c7","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

the struct info analysis returned `kFailL2` (compatible, depending on runtime-inferred symbolic variables) based on each match expression considered in isolation.  This ignored cases such as matching a square tensor `[n,n]` against a static shape `[16,32]`.  While no one dimension is incompatible on its own, the match requires that `(n==16) && (n==32)`.  This this can be statically proven to be false, the `StructInfoBaseChecker` should return `kFailL0` (statically proven to be incompatible) instead.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `StructInfoBaseChecker` to track implied requirements for symbolic variables across multiple matched dimensions.","created_at":"2023-08-27T13:25:47Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:17Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d0c65909b7360a46ba8e72a0d185e7e38b4e7c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ae8bd9bb54e5ea845ca2b48f109e1b67261fb90c","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_catch_incompatible_symbolic_shapes","ref":"unity_catch_incompatible_symbolic_shapes","sha":"ae8bd9bb54e5ea845ca2b48f109e1b67261fb90c","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a distributed runtime that consists of a controler and a cluster of workers. The\r\ncontroler is responsible for managing the workers by broadcasting commands to all the workers\r\ntogether, and the workers are responsible for executing the commands and. The controler and\r\nworkers communicate with each other through a bi-directional channel.\r\n\r\nDifferent from a generic system, Disco is designed to as \"single-program-multiple-data\" (SPMD)\r\nruntime, which means that all the workers execute the same instruction at the same time, but the\r\ndata they are working on may be different. For example, in data parallelism, each worker may\r\nwork on a different batches of the data, but they all execute the same set of instructions.\r\nTherefore, imagine there is a virtual machine that executes the program, the structures of\r\nworkers' register files could be considered as \"identical\" (single program) although the values\r\nmay differ (multiple data).\r\n\r\n**DRef.** Following the design above, consider the program in SPMD in a virtual ISA, then each\r\nworker is a virtual machine instance to execute the ISA maintaining its own register file.\r\nThe controler denotes each of their register files with a unique integer \"register id\",\r\nand the workers use this id to refer to the register file that resides on itself.\r\nDRef is a control-side object backed by such a register id. The data it contains is not assumed\r\nto be directly accessible by the controler, with an exception for worker-0, which is a special\r\nworker that is always co-located with the controler.\r\n\r\n**Worker-0.** Worker-0 is a special worker that is always co-located with the controler.\r\nIt is assumed that the controler can synchronize with and access the registers of worker-0.\r\nThe Disco session provides multiple APIs to interact specifically with the worker-0.\r\nTo shared data with other workers, a common paradigm in Disco is to copy data from the\r\ncontroler-side NDArray to the worker-0, and then copy it to other workers using primitives on\r\nthe data plane, for example, `broadcast` and `send`.\r\n\r\n**Control plane.** The controler broadcasts commands to all the workers as control signals.\r\nFor example, the control may ask all workers to load a library or call a function respectively.\r\nCommon control signals include: shutdown, retrievel a global PackedFunc, call packed function,\r\netc. The controler is assumed to keep a message channel to each worker to implement the broadcast\r\nbehavior, and the message channel may vary depends on usecases.\r\n\r\n**Data plane.** The data channel is usually used to exchange data between workers, especially for\r\ntensor data which is usually large. For example, performing an allreduce operator for sharded\r\nmatrix multiplication, or broadcasting for an input tensor. For efficiency, the data channel is\r\nusually backed by NCCL on NVIDIA GPUs, RCCL on AMD GPUs, or MPI on CPUs.\r\n\r\n**Session.** A Disco session is a primary interface to interact with the Disco runtime, serving\r\nas a global context that manages the control and workers. It could be implemented as a\r\nmulti-threaded with a pool of workers for single-node multi-gpu scenarios, or TCP sockets for\r\nworkloads that span over a cluster of nodes.\r\n\r\n**Channel.** Disco channel is a bi-directional communication channel between the controler and\r\nworkers for exchanging control signals. It is no different from a generic RPC channel, but\r\nadopts TVM's PackedFunc calling convention to support polymorphic and variadic arguments.\r\n\r\nJoined work with

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the first part of Milestone 0: Build MSCGraph core parts. Enable translation between Relay, Relax and MSCGraph without loss information.\r\n\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 0 will be split into 5 steps:\r\nM0.1: Passes for set name and layout for expressions (src/contrib/msc/transform)\r\nM0.2: MSCGraph core (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph && python/tvm/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph)\r\nM0.3: MSCGraph Builder (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph_builder)\r\nM0.4: Codegen (src/contrib/msc/core/codegen, src/contrib/msc/framework/tvm/codegen)\r\nM0.5: Translation test (relax/relay test && related helper modules in python)\r\n\r\nThis PR add test for GraphBuilder and MSCGraph.\r\n\r\nGraphBuilder translate relax/relay function to MSCGraph. Implement of GraphBuilder is similar to GraphCreator in: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/src/relax/transform/fuse_ops.cc\r\n\r\nThe MSCGraph built form relax will be used as \"IR\" in all MSC process. This PR test MSCGraph by check the consistency. To keep the unittest clean and tiny, MSCGraph.inspect() is used as the readable \"hash\" of a MSCGraph. A inspect extract all the important infos in graph to dict, and can be used as the abstract of the graph.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

: Unary ops calculate the value during runtime which is costly. Since we are handling quantized data hence, it is better to pre compute the value during compile time (for 0 -256 value) and store in a Look Up Table which is accessed during the runtime. \r\n\r\n**Implementation** : This pass generates the Look Up Table for each unary op during compile time. It iterates over the original graph and replaces the unary ops call node, (example tanh, sqrt) to a call node that accesses a Look Up Table corresponding to the unary op, and return the value. \r\n\r\n**Testing** : The test_take checks for both value correctness and structural correctness of the output generated after the pass.

PR adds support for the `Attention` layer in the nn module API. This layer mimics the behavior of the [Attention layer used in huggingface Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/80871ac5971fe7e708befa3b553463c4e61b22ab/src/diffusers/models/attention_processor.py#L36). Under the hood it uses scaled dot product attention. Notably, there are still some missing features. For example I didnt add support for attention masks yet. I also am assuming 3 dimensional inputs so this likely wouldnt be useful for the VAE of stable diffusion. However, it does allow us to represent the all attention layers of the UNET. I'm hoping we can expand on the functionality more if needed in future

inspected.","created_at":"2023-08-20T13:32:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T21:22:18Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T05:26:22Z","merged_at":"2023-09-08T05:26:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5a4f66fdc7008805c50550d6cfbfac79b9e8902","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/62ef5ff1cc88e4348792d9b073ba5d35668a0b3e","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ffi_propagate_python_exceptions","ref":"ffi_propagate_python_exceptions","sha":"62ef5ff1cc88e4348792d9b073ba5d35668a0b3e","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces a DSOLibrary cache that ensures a DSO library is only dlopen-ed once in a single process. This guard is less useful per se as Linux already provides such guanratee backed by reference counter:\r\n\r\n> If the same library is loaded again with dlopen(), the same file handle\r\n> is returned. The dl library maintains reference counts for library\r\n> handles, so a dynamic library is not deallocated until dlclose() has\r\n> been called on it as many times as dlopen() has succeeded on it. The\r\n> _init() routine, if present, is only called once. But a subsequent call\r\n> with RTLD_NOW may force symbol resolution for a library earlier loaded\r\n> with RTLD_LAZY.\r\n\r\nLink: https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will help TVM

Apache Team,\r\n\r\nI'm thrilled to submit my seventh contribution to Apache! I've addressed the issue of weak comparing ==  inside the runtime.ts. Paying attention to such details is vital for code quality, and I'm committed to enhancing the project.\r\n\r\nI've made some changes to the `runtime.ts` file to ensure consistent usage of equality comparison and improve code readability. Here's a summary of the changes made in this pull request:\r\n\r\nChanged `==` to `===` for equality comparison in the following places:\r\n   - In `endScope()`: Changed `if (this.autoDisposeScope.length == 0)` to `if (this.autoDisposeScope.length === 0)`\r\n   - In `attachToCurrentScope()`: Changed `if (this.autoDisposeScope.length == 0)` to `if (this.autoDisposeScope.length === 0)`\r\n   - In `DLDevice` constructor: Changed `if (tp == \"string\")` to `if (tp === \"string\")`\r\n   - In `DLDevice` constructor: Changed `} else if (tp == \"number\")` to `} else if (tp === \"number\")`\r\n   - In `sync()`: Changed `if (this.deviceType == DeviceStrToEnum.webgpu)` to `if (this.deviceType === DeviceStrToEnum.webgpu)`\r\n   - In `NDArray` constructor: Changed `if (this.dtype == \"float32\")` to `if (this.dtype === \"float32\")`\r\n   - In `Instance` class: Various changes to ensure consistent equality comparison using `===`\r\n\r\nThese changes enhance the codebase by using strict equality comparison and maintaining consistent coding style.\r\n\r\n--

arm_cpu strategy bug which was causing tensorization errors when using the `AlterOpLayout` pass for the quantized NHWC conv2d schedules, as discovered in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10724. Therefore, we can now also enable the usage of `AlterOpLayout` for these schedules in order to transform the weight matrix at compile time, instead of runtime as before.  \r\n\r\nI also modified the padding in `Conv2DGemmWeightTransformRel` and `interleave_transpose_weights` to reflect the changes made in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13669 and updated the AlterOpLayout tests accordingly.

debugging IRModule transformations, it can be useful to know the exact C++ address of an object.  For example, to determine whether an undefined TIR variable was caused by erroneous insertion of a new variable, or from failing to remove a previous variable.  While TVMScript does de-duplicate all names within a single print statement, there isn't a convenient way to identify which variable in TVMScript corresponds to a specific variable in C++ logging statements.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds `show_object_address` to the `PrinterConfig`.  If false (the default), no change is made to the TVMScript variable names.  If true, the address of the C++ object is appended to the variable name.  For example, printing a `tir.Var('my_name','int64')` as `\"my_name_0x1234abcd\"`.","created_at":"2023-08-16T19:25:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T15:44:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-21T08:21:38Z","merged_at":"2023-08-21T08:21:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"072a5c1bc082a70245fe872e5703d39f843cfb47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9d98bca136596f28356f2800fdbe80da2d7c9441","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_optionally_print_cpp_address","ref":"tvmscript_optionally_print_cpp_address","sha":"9d98bca136596f28356f2800fdbe80da2d7c9441","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, a `relax.PrimValue` could have a datatype, but couldn't have a corresponding `tir.PrimExpr`.  As a result, it could not be used to specify tensor shapes.  This makes some expressions require fallback to `R.Tensor(ndim=ndim)`, even though the shape could still be inferred.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Prior to this commit, attempts to use `R.Prim` when \r\n# a `tir.PrimExpr` is required would result in an error.\r\n@R.function\r\ndef func(\r\n    A: R.Tensor(16, 16),\r\n    first_n_rows: R.Prim(\"int64\"),\r\n) -> R.Tensor([first_n_rows, 16]):\r\n    #          ^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n    #          R.Tensor requires a PrimExpr, not relax.Expr\r\n    #\r\n    #                               Operations may require PrimExpr\r\n    #                                                  vvvvvvvvvvvv\r\n    out = R.op.strided_slice(axis=[0], begin=[0], end=[first_n_rows])\r\n    return out\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a `Optional<PrimExpr> value` field to the `PrimStructInfo`.  This field acts similarly to the `PrimExpr` fields already used in `ShapeStructInfo`, and may contain symbolic variables.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef func(\r\n    A: R.Tensor(16, 16),\r\n\r\n    # TIR definitions in signature allow in-line definitions,\r\n    # similar to R.Tensor and R.Shape.

In most cases (`profile_all_alignments = False`, the default), we just want to pick the largest-possible alignment. To prevent the conv2d profiling time from blowing up in the default path, this PR adds a fix on top of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14275.

to this PR, the GeMV contains an assumption that \"the grouped dimension of the largest tensor in GeMV must has the same iter type as the innermost dimension\", which is enforced by an assertion.\r\n\r\nSince AutoGPTQ quantization only supports KN GeMV layout, the decode-GeMV generated under the AutoGPTQ quantization has the pattern where the reduction dimension is not the innermost and is grouped. This pattern does not follow the assersion above and thus an assertion error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the logic to skip transforming such cases, instead of asserting the assumption. One real AutoGPTQ decode-GeMV workload is added as a test case for future

is a pull request for MSC(Multi-System Compile)\r\nRFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-unity-msc-introduction-to-multi-system-compiler/15251/5\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the first part of Milestone 0: Build MSCGraph core parts. Enable translation between Relay, Relax and MSCGraph without loss information.\r\n\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 0 will be split into 5 steps:\r\nM0.1: Passes for set name and layout for expressions (src/contrib/msc/transform)\r\nM0.2: MSCGraph core (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph && python/tvm/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph)\r\nM0.3: MSCGraph Builder (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph_builder)\r\nM0.4: Codegen (src/contrib/msc/core/codegen, src/contrib/msc/framework/tvm/codegen)\r\nM0.5: Translation test (relax/relay test && related helper modules in python)\r\n\r\nThis PR add the very basic data structure for MSC, thus MSCGraph and WeightGraph.\r\n\r\nMSCGraph is a DAG structure built from relax or relay function. It saves the info of every Expr and will be used in all the MSC submodules. Structure of MSCGraph is similar with the tf.Graph in tensorflow, thus a graph has nodes (MSCJoint) and tensors (MSCTensor). Each node has parent and children, and each tensor has producer and consumers. To manage the weights in computational graph, the MSCGraph define some Constants as weights, for example the 2nd input of Call(nn.conv2d) will be defined as a weight(\"weight\") of the node. That is essential when we process the weights in computational graph, especially for training stage.\r\n\r\nWeightGraph is a DAG structure built from MSCGraph. It describes the topology of weights in MSCGraph. WeightGraph is needed in weight pruning and mask generation for sparse training, when relationship between weights are necessary to make prune strategy. WeightGraph also contains nodes (WeightJoint) and tensors (MSCTensor).\r\n\r\nTests of the MSCGraph will be added in next step(M0.3 MSCGraph Builder). Because the MSCGraph can only be built from relax or relay, no tests can be execute before we build a MSCGraph.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy
