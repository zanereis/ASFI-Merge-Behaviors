Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13684](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13684) Updates the `nifi-runtime` Management Server `/health/cluster` HTTP response to return HTTP 503 when the cluster connection state is not `CONNECTED` or `CONNECTING`. This change preserves the current behavior of the `nifi.sh cluster-status` command to return the information to the console, but provides an HTTP response code that corresponds to the content of the connection state.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13665](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13665) Refactors the NiFi Bootstrap and Runtime process handling components in `nifi-bootstrap` and `nifi-runtime` for streamlined start and status operations.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-bootstrap` module includes a new main class `BootstrapProcess` that replaces the `RunNiFi` class. The `BootstrapProcess` class delegates argument parsing and requests instances of the `BootstrapCommand` interface, which extends `java.lang.Runnable` and provides a `CommandStatus` with exit code for each command.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-runtime` module includes a new `ManagementServer` interface and `StandardManagementServer` implementation based on the standard Java [HttpServer](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/jdk.httpserver/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpServer.html). The `HttpServer` implementation replaces the custom TCP socket protocol implementation and provides the same set of status and diagnostics methods over an HTTP server running on the localhost address. The default configuration starts the Management Server on `127.0.0.1:52020` and also selects an alternative port when the default port is already bound.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP Management Server in `nifi-runtime` supports status and control commands from `nifi-bootstrap` using the standard Java [HttpClient](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html) class.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-bootstrap` module makes use of the Java [ProcessHandle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ProcessHandle.html) abstraction to check for the status of existing application processes. The `ProcessHandle` implementation provides access to command arguments on Linux and macOS supporting commands enumerated in `nifi.sh`. The `ProcessHandle` implementation on Windows does not return command arguments, so the `nifi.cmd start` command uses child process monitoring to watch the application process status. This strategy avoids the need for creating and maintaining a process identifier file in a separate run directory.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi.sh run` command keeps the application process in the foreground without the need for the bootstrap process.\r\n\r\nOther changes include removing `dump` and `env` commands as duplicative of the `diagnostics` command. The `nifi-system-test-suite` uses the new process building abstractions for direct control over application processes instead of mediation through the `RunNiFi` class.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13661) Adds a `MultipartFormDataStreamBuilder` interface and standard implementation to the `nifi-web-client-api` module supporting [RFC 7578](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578).\r\n\r\nThe builder implementation supports creation of an `InputStream` that returns a sequence of one or more byte arrays or streams, structured according to the `multipart/form-data` specification.\r\n\r\nThe builder includes a `getHttpContentType()` method that returns the prepared value of an HTTP `Content-Type` request header, containing `multipart/form-data` and the generated boundary separator required for delimiting form data sections. \r\n\r\nThe `build()` method returns an `InputStream` that can be used directly with the existing `WebClientService` interface to send request body streams. This integration strategy enables wider use of the `nifi-web-client-api` through the framework without introducing any external dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13532](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13532) Corrects the behavior of the Flow Configuration History REST API to maintain the sort direction when filtering on user identity or source identifier.\r\n\r\nThe Entity Store implementation based on JetBrains Xodus supports sorting, which works as expected without applying any filters. The initial implementation applied sorting prior to filtering, resulting in unsorted results when with a filter entered. The corrected approach applies sorting after any filters, ensuring the correct sorting behavior in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13653](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13653) Fixes Sensitive Dynamic Property update handling to avoid removing sensitive status on partial property updates.\r\n\r\nThe new web user interface sends partial property updates to Processors and does not include the complete list of sensitive dynamic property names. This change in behavior highlighted persistence handling issues when updating a partial set of component properties. The updated behavior retains sensitive dynamic property names unless a specific property value is removed, at which time, the sensitive dynamic property name is also removed. This change preserves the existing expectation that changing the status of a sensitive dynamic property requires removing the property, saving the changes, and setting a new value for the property.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13652](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13652) Adds handling for the HTTP `Range` request header in content download REST resource methods.\r\n\r\n[RFC 9110 Section 14](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#range.requests) describes range requests where clients can send the `Range` header with a specified number of bytes. The range request specification allows for multiple ranges, but the current implementation supports requesting a single range with either a first and last position, or a last position, which indicates the last number of bytes.\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes a `StreamingOutputResponseBuilder` that encapsulates `Range` header parsing, sets appropriate `Content-Range` response headers, and builds a `StreamingOutput` wrapper around the content stream that skips and limits as requested.\r\n\r\nThe implementation returns an HTTP 206 Partial Content response for satisfied ranges of bytes. The implementation also returns an HTTP 416 Range Not Satisfiable response when the first position requested is outside the bounds of the content stream.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13647) Improves the behavior of the `ListenOTLP` Processor when sending HTTP error responses the clients, removing the immediate server socket close listener. This behavior resulted intermittent unit test failures due to the server socket closing the connection before the test client completed reading the response. Removing the socket close step allows the server to follow the same handling steps as the completion of sending a successful response.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

declared `RecordFieldType.MAP`](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/38292762bd2872db47561ae3796a8adb8aaa27ac/nifi-commons/nifi-record-path/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/record/path/functions/MapOf.java#L59).\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13622](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13622) Corrects core framework redirect handling for logout completion requests when NiFi is deployed behind a reverse proxy server with an alternative context path.\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation works as expected when the context path is unchanged, but the Jetty Redirect Pattern Rule does not account for the custom forwarded context path headers. Refactoring the approach to use a Servlet Filter based on the shared `RedirectUriHandler` from `nifi-web-servlet-shared` ensures correct redirect URI construction.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

This feature is described in [NIFI-12898](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12898) and the [feature proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Asset+Management).\r\n\r\nA new framework extension - `AssetManager` -  is responsible for storing/retrieving assets on the file system. \r\n\r\nThe following REST end-points are added:\r\n\r\nCreate/upload an asset:\r\n`POST /parameter-contexts/{id}/assets`  \r\n\r\nList assets:\r\n`GET  /parameter-contexts/{id}/assets`\r\n\r\nGet asset content:\r\n`GET  /parameter-contexts/{id}/assets/{assetId}`\r\n\r\nThe last two end-points are primarily intended to be used when a node joins the cluster for it to compare it's current assets with the coordinator and synchronize it's assets to match.\r\n\r\nTo reference an asset it is done through a normal parameter context update, where a parameter will send no value and instead provide an asset reference:\r\n```\r\nreferencedAssets: [\r\n  {\r\n     \"id\": \"assetId1\"\r\n  },\r\n {\r\n     \"id\": \"assetId2\"\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe back-end will automatically make the value of the parameter become the concatenated paths of the referenced assets.\r\n\r\nThe following CLI commands were added:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi create-asset -pcid <param-context-id> -af <full-path-to-a-file>\r\n\r\nnifi list-assets -pcid <param-context-id>\r\n\r\nnifi add-asset-reference -pcid <param-context-id> -pn <param-name> -aid <asset-id>\r\n\r\nnifi remove-asset-reference -pcid <param-context-id> -pn <param-name> -aid <asset-id>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a parameter context is updated, any asset that was previously referenced by a parameter and no longer referenced after the update will be deleted.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13602) Corrects the behavior of the `logoutSupported` property in the Current User REST API Response status when NiFi is running in a cluster.\r\n\r\nFollowing changes for the new user interface in NiFi 2.0.0-M4, the Current User response includes a `logoutSupported` property that controls the visibility of the logout link. This is necessary as the REST API determines whether the client is presenting an Application Bearer Token or an X.509 Client Certificate for authentication.\r\n\r\nWhen running in a cluster, a node replicates requests for the current user to all nodes, instead of using the local response status. With request replication using X.509 Client Certificates for cluster node requests, the `logoutSupported` property always returned `false`, regardless of the browser client authentication method.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the behavior, changes include checking the local Current User status and using that value of `logoutSupported` instead of the replicated and merged status.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13599](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13599) Replaces the Apache Commons Codec `Hex` usage with Java

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13594](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13594) Adds a `nifi-web-servlet-shared` module containing classes abstracted from `nifi-web-utils` related to proxy request header parsing and URI building.\r\n\r\nThese changes decouple HTTP servlet request processing from client web request configuration, providing a clearer distinction between web utilities. Changes include moving `RequestUriBuilder` to the new module and renaming `WebUtils` to `WebClientUtils` along with updating references.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Below is a chart of all attributes the UnpackContent processor now has and the ones in bold are the ones which have been added. For tar files the `file.creationTime` before this PR used the `file.lastModifiedTime` but now if the  actual `file.creationTime` is available it is used and only defaults to using the `file.lastModifiedTime` if the `file.creationTime` is not available (this same logic is now employed for unencrypted zip files). For enrypted zip files the value for `file.lastModifiedTime` is used for the attribute `file.lastModifiedTime` and `file.creationTime`.\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\nJava Variable | Attribute Name | Tar | Unencrypted Zip | Encrypted Zip\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nFILE_LAST_MODIFIED_TIME_ATTRIBUTE | file.lastModifiedTime | Y | Y | Y\r\nFILE_CREATION_TIME_ATTRIBUTE | file.creationTime | **Y** | **Y** | **Y**\r\n**FILE_LAST_METADATA_CHANGE_ATTRIBUTE** | **file.lastMetadataChange** | **Y** | N | N\r\n**FILE_LAST_ACCESS_TIME_ATTRIBUTE** | **file.lastAccessTime** | **Y** | **Y** | N\r\nFILE_OWNER_ATTRIBUTE | file.owner | Y | N | N\r\nFILE_GROUP_ATTRIBUTE | file.group | Y | N | N\r\n**FILE_SIZE_ATTRIBUTE** | **file.size** | **Y** | **Y** | **Y**\r\nFILE_PERMISSIONS_ATTRIBUTE | file.permissions | Y | **Y** | N\r\nFILE_ENCRYPTION_METHOD_ATTRIBUTE | file.encryptionMethod | N | Y | Y\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nCurrently Zip4j the implementation used for encrypted zip files does not have access methods for `file.permissions` `file.creationTime` and `file.lastAccessTime`.

However, as we near the release of 2.0.0, now is an appropriate time to make such a change.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed odd that there is a service named StandardRestrictedSSLContextService with both \"standard\" and \"restricted\" in its name. Historically, there is logic to this naming. There is an interface, RestrictedSSLContextService, which at one time was distinctly different from the SSLContextService interface. However, the two are now identical.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to consolidate naming conventions. The RestrictedSSLContextService interface has been removed. All references to it have been updated to SSLContextService. Removing the interface also allows the implementation name to become RestrictedSSLContextService rather than StandardRestrictedSSLContextService.\r\n\r\nThere are no functional changes here. Rather this only updates the naming of interfaces and corresponding implementations.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13587)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13575) Enables the `throwUnavailableOnStartupException` property for configured Web Applications in the framework Jetty Server. This property instructs Jetty to throw exceptions caught when starting a configured Web Applications, instead of just capturing and storing the exception. This approach removes the need for iterating over configured Jetty Server Handlers, and avoids potential issues related to nested handlers, ensuring that a Web Application exception will cause the Jetty Server to shutdown instead of continuing the startup process.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13562) Migrates the `nifi-web-api-context.xml` Spring Framework configuration to Java Configuration classes with annotations. This migration completes the move from XML to Java configuration for components managed through the Spring Framework.\r\n\r\nThe migration introduces stereotype annotation-based scanning for selected components, using `Controller` for REST Resource classes, `Service` for Auditor classes, and `Repository` for DAO implementation classes. This approach limits component scanning to selected packages and uses the `Bean` annotation to define wiring for other services, following the pattern of existing framework and web security components.\r\n\r\nThe use of `Autowired` on scanned classes enables the migration without other code changes. Several `Autowired` annotations have the `required` property set to `false` as a small set of components can be `null` in non-clustered deployments.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Start NiFi Registry and create a bucket. Import a flow to that bucket. \r\n2. Open the controller settings modal in the NiFi UI and add a registry client. Point the url to the NiFi Registry url. \r\n3. Add a Process Group and import the flow you just created in registry. \r\n4. Make some changes to the flow (can be as simple as renaming a processor). Right click on the process group and select Version > Commit local changes. Save your changes.\r\n5. Repeat step 4 so you have another set of committed changes (so 3 versions total, though you could do more if you’d like).\r\n6. Right click on the process group and select Version > Change version\r\n7. You’ll see a new icon to the left of the Version column in the versions table (see 1st image below). Click on an icon that isn’t the current version. You should see a modal launch listing the differences between the two versions (see 2nd image below). \r\n8. Try adjusting the version selection dropdowns. If you compare the same version, you should see a message informing you that there are no differences (see 3rd image below).\r\n9. The filter should apply whatever input it has across the 3 columns (component name, change type, and difference).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 4 49 06

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13577) Corrects `null` value handling in the `StandardParameterValueMapper` used to serialize values prior to writing the flow
