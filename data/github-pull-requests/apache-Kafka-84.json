PR changes the `TimeOrderedKeySchema` composite key from `time-seq-key` -> `time-key-seq` to allow deletion of duplicated time-key records using the RocksDB `deleteRange`  API. It also removes all duplicates when `put(key, null)` is called. Currently, the `put(key, null)` was a no-op, which was causing problems because there was no way to delete any keys when duplicates are allowed.\r\n\r\nThe RocksDB `deleteRange(keyFrom, keyTo)` deletes a range of keys from `keyFrom` (inclusive) to `keyTo` (exclusive). To make `keyTo` inclusive, I incremented the end key by one when calling the `RocksDBAccessor`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

NPE arrises, if we cannot setup topics quickly enough, and run into a timeout -- for this case, we try to call `admit.delete` (note that `admin` is mocked) that returns `null`.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should never actually \"abort\" the internal topic creation. -- Using `MockTime` instead of `SystemTime` should avoid this issue, as time won't advance at all.

change serves two purposes:\r\n1. Eliminate unnecessary log messages for offset commit of tasks that don't need to perform offset commits (e.g., a task that has failed and for which all data has been flushed and committed)\r\n2. Stop blocking the offset commit thread unnecessarily for flushes that will never succeed because the task's producer has failed to send a record in the current batch with a non-retriable error\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests for the `OffsetStorageWriter` are tweaked to verify the small change made to it. Several new unit tests are added for the `WorkerSourceTask` that cover various cases where offset commits should not be attempted, and some existing tests are modified to cover cases where offset commits either should or should not be attempted.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-12T15:08:24Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T16:39:20Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T14:15:43Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T14:15:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"18e60cb0001f72018d9d00221253f69b8761a2e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ebaeeaaf95b167ce1c83c02d0fb1dc4129785bc4","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-12497","ref":"kafka-12497","sha":"ebaeeaaf95b167ce1c83c02d0fb1dc4129785bc4","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

address KAFKA-10816, the root resource (`GET /`) is modified to go through the worker's herder tick thread. This causes all requests to that resource to either not complete or be met with a 404 response before the worker has finished startup and is ready to handle requests.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being made a viable readiness probe, the root resource is also made into a health probe for the worker. If the worker is having trouble reading to the end of the config topic or (re-)joining the Connect cluster, requests to the root resource will not return and will eventually be met with a 500 timeout response.\r\n\r\nThe hacky workaround used to check for worker readiness in the `BlockingConnectorTest` is modified to use the root resource instead. No other tests are touched; existing coverage should be sufficient to vet this

The offsets can no longer be converted to relative offsets\r\n\r\nAnd the first 4 were already trackable from the existing debug log message, but 5 was missing so I'm suggesting to add it in the existing one. \r\nThere was also an extra `}`  that's a typo in the log string  that I've removed. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Since the previous\r\nrelease of KRaft did not support authorizers, this bug is not as severe\r\nas it could have been, but it still needs to be fixed.  This PR also\r\nadds unit tests to verify that all of the controller operations return\r\nauthorization failures when appropriate.  Fix how duplicate\r\nconfiguration resources are handled.\r\n\r\nAdd support for the ALTER_CONFIGS API, and stub functions for\r\ncluster reassignment, as specified in KIP-631.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,

is part of the implementation for [KIP-730](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-730%3A+Producer+ID+generation+in+KRaft+mode) \r\n\r\nThis change adds a new AllocateProducerIds RPC which is used by the broker to ask for a block of producer IDs from the controller. In particular, this PR only includes changes for the broker and zookeeper-based controller.\r\n\r\nIn [ProducerIdManager.scala](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10504/files#diff-ef2ac0c9264a461805e6c5ca5624428755a31239edf4057ae7a1c561bbec12c1), I've added a prefetch to avoid the case of an InitProducerId request being blocked waiting on an AllocateProducerIds request. Once the generated producer ID has reached 90% of the current block, the next block is fetched and stored locally until it is needed. This could lead to blocks being needlessly consumed in the case of a broker shutdown before it block is needed, but that's probably not a big concern.\r\n\r\nAnother change was to factor out the data class ProducerIsBlock into the shiny and new ✨server-common✨ module. The class is currently used by the broker and controller, and in the next PR it will be used by the KRaft controller.\r\n\r\nSome of the ZK-related code was reorganized, but the format of the ZK data is unchanged for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nIn [KafkaServer.scala](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10504/files#diff-3638ff970bc6766f9e570f76a6440966930b990af33e53e5b3db9d65f90264e9), I am reusing the same network channel as the forwarding manager. This was done to avoid proliferation of these broker to controller channels.","created_at":"2021-04-08T18:02:30Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T19:58:50Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T19:58:49Z","merged_at":"2021-05-21T19:58:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"72d108274c98dca44514007254552481c731c958","assignee":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3262171fa02df1f847ae5afc874133dd2582aafd","head":{"label":"mumrah:kafka-12620-producer-ids-controller","ref":"kafka-12620-producer-ids-controller","sha":"3262171fa02df1f847ae5afc874133dd2582aafd","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

introduces topic IDs to topics, but there is a small issue with how the metadata topic will interact with topic IDs. \r\n\r\nFor example, https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9944 aims to replace topic names in the Fetch request with topic IDs. In order to get these IDs, brokers must fetch from the metadata topic. This leads to a sort of \"chicken and the egg\" problem concerning how we find out the metadata topic's topic ID. \r\n\r\nOne solution proposed in KIP-516 was to introduce a \"sentinel ID\" for the metadata topic. This is a reserved ID for the metadata topic only.  This PR adds the sentinel ID when creating the metadata log.\r\nMore information can be found in the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12457) and in [KIP-516](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-516%3A+Topic+Identifiers)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

various build optimizations to take full advantage of Gradle's incremental build feature, and Gradle's local build caching feature. The optimizations will help to reduce build times for developers when running builds locally.\r\n\r\nSpecific optimizations:\r\n\r\n  - **Enable the local build cache**\r\n     The local build cache avoids re-running tasks whose inputs have not changed, even if the build output has been cleaned or if the build is executed in a different directory.\r\n\r\n  - **Instruct Gradle to ignore version files when doing up-to-date checks**\r\n     This can save a lot of developer time when working locally and creating a lot of commits. In particular, tests won't be re-executed simply because the commit ID changes (unless one of the other test inputs changes).\r\n\r\n  - **Update createVersionFile tasks support incremental builds**\r\n     The version files are no longer recreated unless one of their inputs changes (the commit ID or the version property).\r\n\r\n  - **Set the root project name in settings.gradle**\r\n     The root project name is used to name the build as a whole. It is used in reports and other types of artifacts. If a root project name is not set, then the containing directory's name is used as the root project name.\r\n\r\n     It is a best-practice to explicitly set the root project name. Otherwise, the root project name could change if the directory the project belongs to is different from the desired name (for example, of someone checks out the repository into a directory named differently from the default).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

[#5344](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5344#issuecomment-413350338) it came to our attention that the StreamsConfig overloads of the KafkaStreams constructors are actually quite useful for dependency injection, providing a cleaner way to configure dependencies and better type safety. \r\n\r\nWe considered removing these deprecated overloads in the upcoming 3.0 release, but decided against it for the above reasons. Since we no longer intend to remove these APIs it makes sense to drop the Deprecation entirely, so users can start or continue to use them without worry.","created_at":"2021-04-06T02:46:00Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T04:13:33Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T04:13:33Z","merged_at":"2021-04-08T04:13:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9c5a3995abcf5ddda16ff4ae4ad19be97035e9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cf520b432cadb349f2ca7d424da5b81cc77dc17d","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:7527-un-deprecate-StreamsConfig-overloads-of-KafkaStreams-constructors","ref":"7527-un-deprecate-StreamsConfig-overloads-of-KafkaStreams-constructors","sha":"cf520b432cadb349f2ca7d424da5b81cc77dc17d","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

In order to ensure that a newly elected leader's committed entries cannot get lost, it must commit one record from its own epoch. This guarantees that its latest entry is larger (in terms of epoch/offset) than any previously written record which ensures that any future leader must also include it. This is the purpose of the `LeaderChange` record which is written to the log as soon as the leader gets elected.\r\n\r\nAlthough we had this check implemented, it was off by one. We only ensured that replication reached the epoch start offset, which does not reflect the appended `LeaderChange` record. This patch fixes the check and clarifies the point of the check.

KafkaRaftClient has a field for the BatchAccumulator that is only used and set when it is the leader.

QuorumState makes sure to always close the previous state before transitioning to the next state.

this PR, I have refactored the recovery logic code introducing a new class `kafka.log.LogLoader` responsible for all activities related with recovery of log segments from disk. With this change, the recovery logic has been moved out of the `Log` class and into the new `LogLoader` class. \r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\nThis refactor has the following advantages over the existing code:\r\n\r\n * As such, the recovery logic is invoked once only during `Log` instantiation. Some parts of the recovery logic are fairly independent from the rest of the `Log` class. By moving the independent private logic to a separate `LogLoader` class, the existing  `Log` class has become more modular, and the constructor behavior is a lot simpler now. Therefore, this makes the code more maintainable.\r\n * This PR takes us a step closer towards the Log layer reactor work (KAFKA-12554). The Log recovery logic reads and writes to `LeaderEpochFileCache` and `ProducerStateManager` instances, so as such the logic does not fit very well into the definition of a \"local log\". By extracting it out of the `Log` class, in the future this will make it much easier to clearly define the separation of concerns between `LocalLog` and `UnifiedLog`.\r\n\r\n**Note to reviewers:**\r\nMost of this PR is about moving code around (including tests) and sharing static functions wherever possible. In order to start reviewing this PR, it is best to start looking at the sequence of operations when a `Log` instance is created (see `Log.apply()`):\r\n1. First `LogLoader` loads/recovers the segments from disk and using the metadata it also suitably sets up the related components viz. log start offset, recovery point, next offset, leader epoch cache and producer state manager. The entry point for the `LogLoader` is the `LogLoader.load()` API. The implementation is pretty much identical to the previously existing `Log` recovery logic.\r\n2. Next, the log components setup by the `LogLoader` are passed to the `Log` instance during construction. Some of these components are further mutable by the `Log` instance during its lifecycle. The rest of the `Log` class pretty much remains intact, except that some private methods have been converted to static functions to be shared with the recovery logic.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nI'm relying on the newly added `LogLoaderTest.scala` for testing. I have moved 35 recovery related tests out of `LogTest.scala` and into the new `LogLoaderTest.scala` test suite.","created_at":"2021-04-05T15:57:02Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T16:51:28Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T16:20:40Z","merged_at":"2021-04-20T16:20:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b464419e2e4f28444fca653ae5aa8dd7feae9ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/eaf8519fa26ecfe6278edadee83e3604ae496be8","head":{"label":"kowshik:refactor_extract_recovery_logic","ref":"refactor_extract_recovery_logic","sha":"eaf8519fa26ecfe6278edadee83e3604ae496be8","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

methods have been deprecated since 0.11 without replacement since\r\nmessage format 2 moved the checksum to the record batch (instead of the\r\nrecord).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we did not deprecate the constructors that take a checksum\r\n(even though we intended to) so we cannot remove them. I have deprecated\r\nthem for removal in 4.0 and added a single non deprecated constructor to\r\n`ConsumerRecord` and `RecordMetadata` that take all remaining parameters.\r\n`ConsumerRecord` could do with one additional convenience constructor, but\r\nthat requires a KIP and hence should be done separately.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n* Removed `ChecksumMessageFormatter`, which is technically not public\r\nAPI, but may have been used with the console consumer.\r\n* Updated all usages of `ConsumerRecord`/`RecordMetadata` constructors\r\nto use the non deprecated ones.\r\n* Added tests for deprecated `ConsumerRecord/`RecordMetadata`\r\nconstructors.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

the issue with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10847.\r\n\r\nTo fix the above problem, the left/outer stream-stream join processor uses a buffer to hold non-joined records for some time until the window closes, so they are not processed if a join is found during the join window time. If the window of a record closes and a join was not found, then this should be emitted and processed by the consequent topology processor.\r\n\r\nA new time-ordered window store is used to temporary hold records that do not have a join and keep the records keys ordered by time. The `KStreamStreamJoin` has a reference to this new store . For every non-joined record seen, the processor writes it to this new state store without processing it. When a joined record is seen, the processor deletes the joined record from the new state store to prevent further processing. \r\n\r\nRecords that were never joined at the end of the window + grace period are emitted to the next topology processor. I use the stream time to check for the expiry time for determinism results . The `KStreamStreamJoin` checks for expired records and emit them every time a new record is processed in the join processor.\r\n\r\nThe new state store is shared with the left and right join nodes. The new store needs to serialize the record keys using a combined key of `<joinSide-recordKey>`. This key combination helps to delete the records from the other join if a joined record is found. Two new serdes are created for this, `KeyAndJoinSideSerde` which serializes a boolean value that specifies the side where the key is found, and `ValueOrOtherValueSerde` that serializes either V1 or V2 based on where the key was found. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

PR is a precursor to the recovery logic refactor work (KAFKA-12553).\r\n\r\nI've renamed the file: `core/src/test/scala/unit/kafka/log/LogUtils.scala` to `core/src/test/scala/unit/kafka/log/LogTestUtils.scala`. Also I've renamed the underlying lass from `LogUtils` to `LogTestUtils`. This is going to help avoid a naming conflict with a new file called `LogUtils.scala` that I plan to introduce in `core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/` as part of the recovery logic refactor. The new file will also contain a bunch of static functions.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nRelying on existing tests to catch regressions (if any) since this is a simple
