What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when the event reordering happens, especially onJobStart event come after onExecutionEnd event, SQL page in the UI displays weirdly.(for eg:test mentioned in JIRA and also this issue randomly occurs when the TPCDS query  fails due to broadcast timeout etc.)\r\n\r\nThe reason is that, In the SQLAppstatusListener, we remove the liveExecutions entry once the execution ends. So, if a jobStart event come after that, then we create a new liveExecution entry corresponding to the execId. Eventually this will overwrite the kvstore and UI displays confusing entries.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT, Also manually tested with the eventLog, provided in the jira, of the failed query.\r\n\r\nBefore fix:\r\n![screenshot from 2019-03-03 03-05-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/53687929-53e2b800-3d61-11e9-9dca-620fa41e605c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemoved unnecessary conversion of microseconds in `DateTimeUtils.timestampToString` to `java.sql.Timestamp` which aims to output fraction of seconds by casting it to string. This was replaced by special `TimestampFormatter` which appends the fraction formatter to `DateTimeFormatterBuilder`: `appendFraction(ChronoField.NANO_OF_SECOND, 0, 9, true)`. The former one means trailing zeros in second's fraction should be truncated while formatting. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test suites like `CastSuite`, `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `JDBCSuite`, and by new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPySpark's Binarizer docstring had two issues:\r\n1) The values did not need to be in the range [0, 1].\r\n2) It can be used for binary classification prediction.\r\n\r\nThis change corrects both of these issues by making it consistent with Scala's docstring for Binarizer. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot applicable because I only changed the docstring.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCreating an Netty `EventLoopGroup` leads to creating a new Thread pool for handling the events. For stopping the threads of the pool the event loop group should be shut down which is properly done for transport servers and clients by calling for example the `shutdownGracefully()` method (for details see the `close()` method of `TransportClientFactory` and `TransportServer`). But there is a separate event loop group for shuffle chunk fetch requests which is in pipeline for handling fetch request (shared between the client and server) and owned by the `TransportContext` and this was never shut down. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith existing unittest.\r\n\r\nThis leak is in the production system too but its effect is spiking in the unittest. \r\n\r\nChecking the core unittest logs before the PR:\r\n```\r\n$ grep \"LEAK IN SUITE\" unit-tests.log | grep -o shuffle-chunk-fetch-handler | wc -l\r\n381\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd after the PR without whitelisting in thread audit and with an extra `await` after the \r\n` chunkFetchWorkers.shutdownGracefully()`:\r\n```\r\n$ grep \"LEAK IN SUITE\" unit-tests.log | grep -o shuffle-chunk-fetch-handler | wc -l\r\n0\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-01T18:53:05Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T20:33:30Z","closed_at":"2019-03-05T20:33:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3f1a5c5959e19afa18572cec3b097ef411eec92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b469d7710cff094a65329367050c720df4610bd","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-27021","ref":"SPARK-27021","sha":"3b469d7710cff094a65329367050c720df4610bd","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt adds Kafka delegation token support for DStreams. Please be aware as Kafka native sink is not available for DStreams this PR contains delegation token usage only on consumer side.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Usage of token through dynamic JAAS configuration\r\n* `KafkaConfigUpdater` moved to `kafka-0-10-token-provider`\r\n* `KafkaSecurityHelper` functionality moved into `KafkaTokenUtil`\r\n* Documentation\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests + on cluster.\r\n\r\nLong running Kafka to file tests on 4 node cluster with randomly thrown artificial exceptions.\r\n\r\nTest scenario:\r\n\r\n* 4 node cluster\r\n* Yarn\r\n* Kafka broker version 2.1.0\r\n* security.protocol = SASL_SSL\r\n* sasl.mechanism = SCRAM-SHA-512\r\n\r\nKafka broker settings:\r\n\r\n* delegation.token.expiry.time.ms=600000 (10 min)\r\n* delegation.token.max.lifetime.ms=1200000 (20 min)\r\n* delegation.token.expiry.check.interval.ms=300000 (5 min)\r\n\r\nAfter each 7.5 minutes new delegation token obtained from Kafka broker (10 min * 0.75).\r\nWhen token expired after 10 minutes (Spark obtains new one and doesn't renew the old), the brokers expiring thread comes after each 5 minutes (invalidates expired tokens) and artificial exception has been thrown inside the Spark application (such case Spark closes connection), then the latest delegation token picked up correctly.\r\n\r\ncd docs/\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll build\r\nManual webpage check.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-01T14:51:27Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T19:14:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T19:39:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"924f5d5b0d4fbc023e5bc5ac4db8e396f8a031b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07bb7165557c624c1b8b086377949e8949dfd192","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-27022","ref":"SPARK-27022","sha":"07bb7165557c624c1b8b086377949e8949dfd192","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is another attempt to fix the more-than-one-active-task-set-managers bug.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17208 is the first attempt. It marks the TSM as zombie before sending a task completion event to DAGScheduler. This is necessary, because when the DAGScheduler gets the task completion event, and it's for the last partition, then the stage is finished. However, if it's a shuffle stage and it has missing map outputs, DAGScheduler will resubmit it(see the [code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1416-L1422)) and create a new TSM for this stage. This leads to more than one active TSM of a stage and fail.\r\n\r\nThis fix has a hole: Let's say a stage has 10 partitions and 2 task set managers: TSM1(zombie) and TSM2(active). TSM1 has a running task for partition 10 and it completes. TSM2 finishes tasks for partitions 1-9, and thinks he is still active because he hasn't finished partition 10 yet. However, DAGScheduler gets task completion events for all the 10 partitions and thinks the stage is finished. Then the same problem occurs: DAGScheduler may resubmit the stage and cause more than one actice TSM error.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21131 fixed this hole by notifying all the task set managers when a task finishes. For the above case, TSM2 will know that partition 10 is already completed, so he can mark himself as zombie after partitions 1-9 are completed.\r\n\r\nHowever, #21131 still has a hole: TSM2 may be created after the task from TSM1 is completed. Then TSM2 can't get notified about the task completion, and leads to the more than one active TSM error.\r\n\r\n#22806 and #23871 are created to fix this hole. However the fix is complicated and there are still ongoing discussions.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a simple fix, which can be easy to backport: mark all existing task set managers as zombie when trying

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the maven plugin option `treatWarningsAsErrors` to make sure the warnings are treated as errors while generating the parser file. In the absence of it, we may inadvertently introducing problems while making grammar changes.  Please refer to [PR-23897](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23897) to know more about the context.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nWe can use two ways to build Spark 1) sbt 2) Maven\r\nThis PR, we made a change to configure the maven antlr plugin to include a parameter that makes antlr4 report error on warning. However, when spark is built using sbt, we use the sbt antlr plugin which does not allow us to pass this additional compilation flag.  More info on sbt-antlr plugin can be found at [link](https://github.com/ihji/sbt-antlr4/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/simplytyped/Antlr4Plugin.scala) \r\nIn summary, this fix only applicable when we use maven to build.","created_at":"2019-02-28T21:20:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-03T18:02:56Z","closed_at":"2019-03-03T16:06:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92e77bbb8834cb16866853bbf329f892700ea3ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df0f530255c3b01f05aa8ca3712a9f0bf4cf33d5","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:antlr_fix","ref":"antlr_fix","sha":"df0f530255c3b01f05aa8ca3712a9f0bf4cf33d5","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRetrieve enableFetcherCache option from submission conf rather than dispatcher conf. This resolves some confusing behavior where Spark drivers currently get this conf from the dispatcher, whereas Spark executors get this conf from the submission. After this change, the conf will only need to be specified once.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith (updated) existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe classloader of spark-shell is IMainsTranslatingClassLoader which is loaded from IMain (scala.tools.nsc.interpreter). But on the first select, it registers the function and loads the hiveUDF jar to sparkContext classloader which is NonClosableMutuableClassLoader. While selecting the function on the second time, function is already registered so it tries to fetch from IMainTranslatingClassLoader  which is giving analysis exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging of the classLoader of currentThread to NonClosableMutuableclassLoader will solve this issue.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-28T14:48:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T11:44:33Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T11:44:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28e35b7837f2d9ce5e223702465707fcde18cfd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51405b06be5cb120db0cc0b7cad8b87ab223a5a3","head":{"label":"nivo091:udf_fix","ref":"udf_fix","sha":"51405b06be5cb120db0cc0b7cad8b87ab223a5a3","user":{"login":"nivo091","id":8516175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8516175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091","html_url":"https://github.com/nivo091","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":173119399,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzMxMTkzOTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"nivo091/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nivo091","id":8516175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8516175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091","html_url":"https://github.com/nivo091","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nivo091/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nivo091/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter we cache a table, we can see its details in Storage Tab of spark UI. If the executor has shutdown ( graceful shutdown/ Dynamic executor scenario) UI still shows the rdd as cached and when we click the link it throws error. This is because on executor remove event, we fail to adjust rdd partition details @ org.apache.spark.status.AppStatusListener#onExecutorRemoved\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHave tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a v2 API for adding new catalog plugins to Spark.\r\n\r\n* Catalog implementations extend `CatalogPlugin` and are loaded via reflection, similar to data sources\r\n* `Catalogs` loads and initializes catalogs using configuration from a `SQLConf`\r\n* `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` is used to pass configuration to `CatalogPlugin` via `initialize`\r\n\r\nCatalogs are configured by adding config properties starting with `spark.sql.catalog.(name)`. The name property must specify a class that implements `CatalogPlugin`. Other properties under the namespace (`spark.sql.catalog.(name).(prop)`) are passed to the provider during initialization along with the catalog name.\r\n\r\nThis replaces #21306, which will be implemented in two multiple parts: the catalog plugin system (this commit) and specific catalog APIs, like `TableCatalog`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test suites for `CaseInsensitiveStringMap` and for catalog loading.","created_at":"2019-02-28T01:35:23Z","updated_at":"2024-08-17T03:01:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T11:34:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcd8cbb2d2bcc8fb0ccfcb9ec4f6dccfc81022e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c64a2678de28224e1dda8c662ca750c5438fc9b","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-24252-add-v2-catalog-plugins","ref":"SPARK-24252-add-v2-catalog-plugins","sha":"7c64a2678de28224e1dda8c662ca750c5438fc9b","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new Catalyst type converter for `DateType`. It should be able to convert `java.time.LocalDate` to/from `DateType`.\r\n\r\nMain motivations for the changes:\r\n- Smoothly support Java 8 time API\r\n- Avoid inconsistency of calendars used inside of Spark 3.0 (Proleptic Gregorian calendar) and `java.sql.Date` (hybrid calendar - Julian + Gregorian).\r\n- Make conversion independent from current system timezone.\r\n\r\nBy default, Spark converts values of `DateType` to `java.sql.Date` instances but the SQL config `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` can change the behavior. If it is set to `true`, Spark uses `java.time.LocalDate` as external type for `DateType`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new testes to `CatalystTypeConvertersSuite` to check conversion of `DateType` to/from `java.time.LocalDate`, `JavaUDFSuite`/ `UDFSuite` to test usage of `LocalDate` type in Scala/Java

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to stop the underlying streaming queries when a spark session is stopped.\r\n\r\nWithout this, the streaming query continues to run and fails with exception during the next trigger.\r\n\r\nFor E.g.\r\n```\r\nval lines = spark.readStream.format(\"socket\").option(\"host\", \"localhost\").option(\"port\", \"9999\").load()\r\nlines.writeStream.format(\"console\").start\r\n...\r\n> send some input\r\n...\r\nspark.stop\r\n...\r\n> send more input\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe job fails with exception\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually. Would add unit tests once I receive feedback on the approach.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T21:02:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T00:07:21Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T00:07:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f0cb700595bb0c4b9ef17912409d33ef6725dc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark not always picking up the latest Kafka delegation tokens even if a new one properly obtained.\r\nIn the PR I'm setting delegation tokens right before `KafkaConsumer` and `KafkaProducer` creation to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLong running Kafka to Kafka tests on 4 node cluster with randomly thrown artificial exceptions.\r\n\r\nTest scenario:\r\n* 4 node cluster\r\n* Yarn\r\n* Kafka broker version 2.1.0\r\n* security.protocol = SASL_SSL\r\n* sasl.mechanism = SCRAM-SHA-512\r\n\r\nKafka broker settings:\r\n* delegation.token.expiry.time.ms=600000 (10 min)\r\n* delegation.token.max.lifetime.ms=1200000 (20 min)\r\n* delegation.token.expiry.check.interval.ms=300000 (5 min)\r\n\r\nAfter each 7.5 minutes new delegation token obtained from Kafka broker (10 min * 0.75).\r\nBut when token expired after 10 minutes (Spark obtains new one and doesn't renew the old), the brokers expiring thread comes after each 5 minutes (invalidates expired tokens) and artificial exception has been thrown inside the Spark application (such case Spark closes connection), then the latest delegation token not always picked up.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T11:00:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T18:10:13Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T18:10:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c010135bbafe0f7498e405ab0f26b3099f8e1aff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c7052345b3c30996adc94aede7274a66c876a34","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-27002","ref":"SPARK-27002","sha":"9c7052345b3c30996adc94aede7274a66c876a34","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading cloudpickle to 0.6.1 at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20691, one regression was found. Cloudpickle had a critical https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/240 for that.\r\n\r\nBasically, it currently looks existing globals would override globals shipped in a function's, meaning:\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def hey():\r\n...     return \"Hi\"\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: hey()).collect()\r\n['Hi']\r\n>>> def hey():\r\n...     return \"Yeah\"\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: hey()).collect()\r\n['Hi']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def hey():\r\n...     return \"Hi\"\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: hey()).collect()\r\n['Hi']\r\n>>>\r\n>>> def hey():\r\n...     return \"Yeah\"\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(1).rdd.map(lambda _: hey()).collect()\r\n['Yeah']\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR upgrades cloudpickle to 0.8.0.\r\n\r\nNote that cloudpickle's release cycle is quite short.\r\n\r\nBetween 0.6.1 and 0.7.0, it contains minor bug fixes. I don't see notable changes to double check and/or avoid.\r\n\r\nThere is virtually only this fix between 0.7.0 and 0.8.1 - other fixes are about testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, tests were added. Verified unit tests were added in cloudpickle.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T04:41:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:47Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T17:36:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11ebe9f5233f642d730201be3dbec912ad793797","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e0afd105ed77c21218fb61f9086f6e5612eb606","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-27000","ref":"SPARK-27000","sha":"3e0afd105ed77c21218fb61f9086f6e5612eb606","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkSQLCLIDriver parse sql statement incorrectly, because its processLine method is not correct.\r\nThe processLine method is one method of CLIDriver, which is a class of hive-cli.\r\nSparkSQLCLIDriver extends CLIDriver, but it does't override processLine method.\r\nThe spark-hive-cliet version of master branch is hive-1.2.1.spark2.\r\nIn hive-1.2.1, the processLine method splits statement directly by \";\",  however, there may be a quote.\r\nFor example:\r\nThe statement:\r\n```\r\n select * from table_a where column_a not like '%;';\r\n```\r\nWill be parsed to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from table_a where column_a not like '%\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I override the processLine of CLIDriver in SPARKSQLCLIDriver based on the implement of apache/hive master branch.\r\nAnd it process the input sql statement correctly.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n \r\nmanual test with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhile processing the Rowdata in the server side ColumnValue BigDecimal type value processed by server has to converted to the HiveDecmal data type

Spark in Docker image with Alpine Linux 3.9.0 throws errors when using snappy. \r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced for example as follows: `Seq(1,2).toDF(\"id\").write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"DELETEME1\")` \r\nThe key part of the error stack is as follows `SparkException: Task failed while writing rows. .... Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/snappy-1.1.7-2b4872f1-7c41-4b84-bda1-dbcb8dd0ce4c-libsnappyjava.so: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Noded by /tmp/snappy-1.1.7-2b4872f1-7c41-4b84-bda1-dbcb8dd0ce4c-libsnappyjava.so)` \r\n\r\nThe source of the error appears to be that libsnappyjava.so needs ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 and looks for it in /lib, while in Alpine Linux 3.9.0 with libc6-compat version 1.1.20-r3 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is located in /lib64.\r\nNote: this issue is not present with Alpine Linux 3.8 and libc6-compat version 1.1.19-r10 \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA possible workaround proposed with this PR is to modify the Dockerfile by adding a symbolic link between /lib and /lib64 so that linux-x86-64.so.2 can be found in /lib. This is probably not the cleanest solution, but I have observed that this is what happened/happens already when using Alpine Linux 3.8.1 (a version of Alpine Linux which was not affected by the issue reported here).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by running a simple workload with spark-shell, using docker on a client machine and using Spark on a Kubernetes cluster. The test workload is: `Seq(1,2).toDF(\"id\").write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"DELETEME1\")` \r\n\r\nAdded a test to the KubernetesSuite /

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to expose an official approach for Java API to create a Row with schema.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis only exposes the way to leverage existing class in official API, hence no UT added.\r\nManually tested against below query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSparkSession sparkSession = SparkSession.builder().master(\"local\").getOrCreate();\r\nStructType inSchema = DataTypes.createStructType(\r\n        new StructField[] {\r\n                DataTypes.createStructField(\"id\", DataTypes.StringType      , false),\r\n                DataTypes.createStructField(\"ts\", DataTypes.TimestampType   , false),\r\n                DataTypes.createStructField(\"f1\", DataTypes.LongType        , true)\r\n        }\r\n);\r\nDataset<Row> rawSet = sparkSession.sqlContext().readStream()\r\n        .format(\"rate\")\r\n        .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", 1)\r\n        .load()\r\n        .map(   (MapFunction<Row, Row>) raw -> {\r\n                    Object[] fields = new Object[3];\r\n                    fields[0] = \"id1\";\r\n                    fields[1] = raw.getAs(\"timestamp\");\r\n                    fields[2] = raw.getAs(\"value\");\r\n                    return RowFactory.createWithSchema(inSchema, fields);\r\n                },\r\n                RowEncoder.apply(inSchema)\r\n        )\r\n        .filter((FilterFunction<Row>) row -> !row.getAs(\"f1\").equals(0L))\r\n        .withWatermark(\"ts\", \"10 seconds\");\r\n\r\nStreamingQuery streamingQuery = rawSet\r\n        .select(\"*\")\r\n        .writeStream()\r\n        .format(\"console\")\r\n        .outputMode(\"append\")\r\n        .start();\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    streamingQuery.awaitTermination(30_000);\r\n} catch (StreamingQueryException e) {\r\n    System.out.println(\"Caught exception at 'awaitTermination':\");\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we change the map function to `return RowFactory.create(fields);`, filter function fails.","created_at":"2019-02-25T21:34:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-06T07:46:52Z","closed_at":"2019-04-06T07:46:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d399ca8035a5c4ced481b6b290af800b295a074c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b98580112b752042d7099e787b6adc4226281652","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-26987","ref":"SPARK-26987","sha":"b98580112b752042d7099e787b6adc4226281652","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMost SQL functions defined in `spark.sql.functions` have two calling patterns, one with a Column object as input, and another with a string representing a column name, which is then converted into a Column object internally.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few notable exceptions:\r\n\r\n- lower()\r\n- upper()\r\n- abs()\r\n- bitwiseNOT()\r\n- ltrim()\r\n- rtrim()\r\n- trim()\r\n- ascii()\r\n- base64()\r\n- unbase64()\r\n\r\nWhile this doesn't break anything, as you can easily create a Column object yourself prior to passing it to one of these functions, it has two undesirable consequences:\r\n\r\n1. It is surprising - it breaks coder's expectations when they are first starting with Spark. Every API should be as consistent as possible, so as to make the learning curve smoother and to reduce causes for human error;\r\n\r\n2. It gets in the way of stylistic conventions. Most of the time it makes Python code more readable to use literal names, and the API provides ample support for that, but these few exceptions prevent this pattern from being universally applicable.\r\n\r\nThis patch is meant to fix the aforementioned problem.\r\n\r\n### Effect\r\n\r\nThis patch **enables** support for passing column names as input to those functions mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Side effects\r\n\r\nThis PR also **fixes** an issue with some functions being defined multiple times by using `_create_function()`.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\n`_create_function()` was redefined to always convert the argument to a Column object. The old implementation has been kept under `_create_name_function()`, and is still being used to generate the following special functions:\r\n\r\n- lit()\r\n- col()\r\n- column()\r\n- asc()\r\n- desc()\r\n- asc_nulls_first()\r\n- asc_nulls_last()\r\n- desc_nulls_first()\r\n- desc_nulls_last()\r\n\r\nThis is because these functions can only take a column name as their argument. This is not a problem, as their semantics require so.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan ./dev/run-tests and tested it manually.","created_at":"2019-02-24T13:04:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T23:22:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-17T18:00:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35bc72493e3901808b981fb6bb189cca220f0a5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23d0222c755e43018fa936c12cafb7f6756976d5","head":{"label":"asmello:col-name-support-pyspark","ref":"col-name-support-pyspark","sha":"23d0222c755e43018fa936c12cafb7f6756976d5","user":{"login":"asmello","id":3285133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODUxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3285133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello","html_url":"https://github.com/asmello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":172223826,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyMjM4MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"asmello/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asmello","id":3285133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODUxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3285133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello","html_url":"https://github.com/asmello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asmello/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an optional solution for #22806 . \r\n\r\n#21131 firstly implement that a previous successful completed task from zombie TaskSetManager could also succeed the active TaskSetManager, which based on an assumption that an active TaskSetManager always exists for that stage when this happen.  But that's not always true as an active TaskSetManager may haven't been created when a previous task succeed, and this is the reason why #22806 hit the issue.\r\n\r\nThis pr extends #21131 's behavior by adding `stageIdToFinishedPartitions` into TaskSchedulerImpl, which recording the finished partition whenever a task(from zombie or active) succeed. Thus, a later created active TaskSetManager could also learn about the finished partition by looking into `stageIdToFinishedPartitions ` and won't launch any duplicate tasks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd.","created_at":"2019-02-22T09:57:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T02:22:42Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T17:55:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ef5d7e62ee10563ab8e6bef95f1f5515cd131a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/989c9d3a60f2caf8db89068571ac67193c7f0c2f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:dev-23433-25250","ref":"dev-23433-25250","sha":"989c9d3a60f2caf8db89068571ac67193c7f0c2f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fix addresses the issue raised in SPARK-26957.  If a spark.scheduler.pool is set to a name that was not a preconfigured pool, the pool was always created with the default properties.  This fix allows the default scheduler pool properties to be configured through configuration parameters.  Previously they were hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThe fix is fully backwards compatible because the configuration properties default to the existing hardcoded values.  This PR just allows those values to be updated.  The specific use case where we needed this was explained in SPARK-26957\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA unit test was added to PoolSuite that sets the config values, generates a pool, and checks that the pool is using the configured values.  An existing test verifies that with no special configuration settings, the original defaults are used.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this unit testing, we are currently using a version of this patch in production on AWS EMR for Spark 2.4.0.\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and that I license the work to the project under the project’s open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to address flakiness I've observed in MLEventsSuite in these tests:\r\n*  test(\"pipeline read/write events\")\r\n*  test(\"pipeline model read/write events\")\r\n\r\nThe issue is in the \"read/write events\" tests, which work as follows:\r\n* write\r\n* wait until we see at least 1 write-related SparkListenerEvent\r\n* read\r\n* wait until we see at least 1 read-related SparkListenerEvent\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the last step does NOT allow any write-related SparkListenerEvents, but some of those events may be delayed enough that they are seen in this last step. We should ideally add logic before \"read\" to wait until the listener events are cleared/complete. Looking into other SparkListener tests, we need to use `sc.listenerBus.waitUntilEmpty(TIMEOUT)`.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the waitUntilEmpty() call.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt's a test!","created_at":"2019-02-21T19:39:25Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T03:24:27Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T02:11:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7807384299d4d6ddf26d9634ec3f9d48750d8a3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12f7a75d856c7e223bc45410bc3a1dad9f3694b2","head":{"label":"jkbradley:SPARK-26960","ref":"SPARK-26960","sha":"12f7a75d856c7e223bc45410bc3a1dad9f3694b2","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimilar to `SaveMode`, we should remove streaming `OutputMode` from data source v2 API, and use operations that has clear semantic.\r\n\r\nThe changes are:\r\n1. append mode: create `StreamingWrite` directly. By default, the `WriteBuilder` will create `Write` to append data.\r\n2. complete mode: call `SupportsTruncate#truncate`. Complete mode means truncating all the old data and appending new data of the current epoch. `SupportsTruncate` has exactly the same semantic.\r\n3. update mode: fail. The current streaming framework can't propagate the update keys, so v2 sinks are not able to implement update mode. In the future we can introduce a `SupportsUpdate` trait.\r\n\r\nThe behavior changes:\r\n1. all the v2 sinks(foreach, console, memory, kafka, noop) don't support update mode. The fact is, previously all the v2 sinks implement the update mode wrong. None of them can really support it.\r\n2. kafka sink doesn't support complete mode. The fact is, the kafka sink can only append data.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark expects the type of column and the type of matching field is same when deserializing to Object, but Spark hasn't actually restrict it (at least for Java bean encoder) and some users just do it and experience undefined behavior (in SPARK-22000, Spark throws compilation failure on generated code because it calls `.toString()` against primitive type.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't produce error in Scala side because `ScalaReflection.deserializerFor` properly inject Upcast if necessary. This patch proposes applying same thing to `JavaTypeInference.deserializerFor` as well.\r\n\r\nCredit to @srowen, @maropu, and @cloud-fan since they provided various approaches to solve this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT which query is slightly modified based on sample code in attachment on JIRA issue.","created_at":"2019-02-21T09:19:34Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T05:55:12Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T05:50:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db204c35048863608b9c5df94cff9f6321b3adc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24a1b195bad49e05353b80c85d30e32e8c898a52","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-22000","ref":"SPARK-22000","sha":"24a1b195bad49e05353b80c85d30e32e8c898a52","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

Actually it would only break when latest compaction batch is requested to be purged, but caller wouldn't be aware of this so safer to just prevent it. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix some outdated comments about task schedulers.\r\n\r\n1. Change \"ClusterScheduler\" to \"YarnScheduler\" in comments of `YarnClusterScheduler`\r\n\r\nAccording to [SPARK-1140 Remove references to ClusterScheduler](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1140), ClusterScheduler is not used anymore.\r\n\r\nI also searched \"ClusterScheduler\" within the whole project, no other occurrences are found in comments or test cases. Note classes like `YarnClusterSchedulerBackend` or `MesosClusterScheduler` are not relevant.\r\n\r\n2. Update comments about `statusUpdate` from `TaskSetManager`\r\n`statusUpdate` has been moved to `TaskSchedulerImpl`. StatusUpdate event handling is delegated to `handleSuccessfulTask`/`handleFailedTask`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A. Fix comments only.","created_at":"2019-02-20T09:04:58Z","updated_at":"2019-02-23T16:56:33Z","closed_at":"2019-02-23T16:56:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e7e18e640e0f22729063c3a29b8e6d8e874da3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/916be33d25ffe5c820f4801c77fc42042a86b4b0","head":{"label":"seancxmao:taskscheduler-comments","ref":"taskscheduler-comments","sha":"916be33d25ffe5c820f4801c77fc42042a86b4b0","user":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121346712,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEzNDY3MTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"seancxmao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao/spark","description":"Mirror
