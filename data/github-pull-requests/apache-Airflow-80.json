on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34790\r\n\r\nPreviously, when there were no logs, we would just use [] or {} and continue to process them through functions such as \"group by host\" and such.  But if no logs are found, it's odd to go down those paths.\r\n\r\nOne example of the confusion is the return type in `es_read` was `list | ElasticSearchResponse`.  This makes it look like it would either be a list (presumably of logs?) or an ElasticSearchResponse object (presumably also containing logs?).  But in reality, the only time list was returned, was when there _were no logs at all!_  This was just to adhere to the contract that we handle \"no logs\" the same as \"logs\".  _(And it turns out that ElasticSearchResponse magically also behaves like at iterable which is also confusing but that's a separate issue.)_","created_at":"2023-10-05T22:18:03Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T06:40:38Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T06:40:37Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T06:40:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3be18b36f6dd96dd57717d6fa0484fc8f02805e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5714936966,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABVKMEhg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:elasticsearch","name":"provider:elasticsearch","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/34793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/34793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/34793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5ad579c6768d40a4eb32b9a47c834b25b992794b","head":{"label":"astronomer:use-none-instead-of-empty-object","ref":"use-none-instead-of-empty-object","sha":"5ad579c6768d40a4eb32b9a47c834b25b992794b","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

I've made the change here, there are a few other places in this hook where `DB[issue]Fault` is used where perhaps `DB[issue]` should be used instead. But I wanted to get this PR up with a minimal change at least to get folks' thoughts :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n\n\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\n---\n**^ Add meaningful

was setting up Airflow with Breeze when I encountered this error: \r\n`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'airflow_breeze.params'`\r\n\r\nCame across this PR (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34701) with the same issue, which also provided the fix. Accordingly, I did try to test with the latest main, but the problem wasn't solved. \r\nWas able to resolve it when I ran `python3 -m pip install pipx packaging==23.1` (from the commit of the above PR) and then ran the breeze command. \r\n\r\nDid anyone else also face this issue? (I installed pipx via brew.)\r\n\r\nIf significant, I've edited the `CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst` to address this potential error.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

A new config item is introduced to allow customer to opt-in to the \"new\" serialization format.\r\n\r\n### Watchtower functionality\r\nWatchtower introduced a change whereby they use `repr` for any non-serializable objects in place of what was just `null`.\r\n\r\n#### Source\r\n```python\r\n{\"datetime\": datetime(2023,1,1), \"customObject\": SomeCustomObject(1, 2, 3)}\r\n```\r\n#### Was\r\n`{\"datetime\": \"2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\", \"customObject\": null}`\r\n\r\n#### Now\r\n`{\"datetime\": \"2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\", \"customObject\": \"SomeCustomSerializationProvidedByRepr(...)\"}`\r\n\r\n### Airflow functionality\r\nThe default behavior for `airflow` will be to maintain the `null` serialization, but allow the option to use the new style (or provide your own).\r\n\r\nThe new config is `logging.json_serializer` which is an import path (string). The import should be a callable taking an object and returning a string.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses: #25019\r\n\r\n@ferruzzi

See [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/#labels) for more details \r\n\r\nA lot of files are being affected but in short\r\n- a new definition `kubernetes_recommended_labels` is added into `_helpers.yaml`\r\n- Apply this new definition to each yaml file, and if applicable, add a new label `app.kubernetes.io/component` (with the value being the same as `component` if the resource was originally labeled with `component`\r\n- Modify a few helm tests as a result of this

to AIP-58](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=263430565) for convenience. — @uranusjr)\r\n\r\n**updated: 2023-10-17**\r\n\r\nThis adds Airflow Store, which is a generic abstraction on top of a filesystem or object storage. It's inspired by databricks fs (dbfs), partially ported from Apache Iceberg and based on `fsspec`. The idea is that you can do the following\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.io.store.path import ObjectStoragePath\r\n\r\nbase = ObjectStoragePath(\"s3://warehouse\", conn_id=\"aws_default\")\r\n\r\n@dag\r\ndef my_dag:\r\n\r\n  @task\r\n  def load_file(src):\r\n     with src.open(\"rb\") as f:\r\n       return f.read()\r\n\r\n  x = load_file(base / \"my_data.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# you can use it the same way in an operator\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nStandard python file operations work (e.g. see shutil.copyfileobj in the generic FileTransfer Operator).\r\n\r\nAs this is based on `fsspec`, any objectstorage or filesystem implementing fsspec is supported. For now s3, gcs, adl and local file systems are supported. There are options for e.g. webhdfs.\r\n\r\nAs fsspec brings a key/value mapper it can be used as a XCom backend in the future. It can also work as a backend for DAGs, so we are not necessarily dependent on git-sync or the likes any more. \r\n\r\nThe astro-sdk abstractions, like `load_file` could be build on top.\r\n\r\nThis is work in progress. An Apache Arrow extension is forthcoming. The intention is to gather feedback :-).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 18 33 03](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/4282712/78f4867c-aae1-400d-87f2-66c08f2e072a)\r\n\r\n\r\n@potiuk

inntializing _timeout_sec of TaskStateTrigger \r\n\r\nPreviously, the state 'self._timeout_sec = 60' fixed timeout seconds to check if dag run exists.\r\nIt caused timeout even if the dag run state is in queued or scheduled due to resource issue like hundreds of dag runs exists and they are pending transitting into running states.\r\n\r\nSo I changed to use execution_timeout instead of fixed 60

This was discussed in a different [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34693) which will be blocked by this PR now. both PRs would be pre-work for completing https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33619 and adding Open Search log integration. \r\n\r\n### Open questions to more experienced contributors:\r\n\r\n1. For system test DAG to succeed would an OpenSearch domain need to be setup and if so what is the approach for standing up such infrastructure for integration tests?\r\n2. Any advice on mypy for some of the operator parameters? The goal is to allow users to either pass in the arguments directly or by passing in a class in the case of Search which works but in the case of adding a document the end user of the Operator needs to subclass the Document class. I am not sure what the best approach is for the typing for that parameter. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmail sent for Lazy Consensus to the dev-list. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

#34624\r\n\r\nCurrently, `max_active_tis_per_dag` and `max_active_tis_per_dagrun` don't consider `deferred` state as an active state, and it's not a bug, since the TI with this state is not running on the worker, but sometimes we use this two parameters to control the interaction with an external system instead of creating a new pool.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new parameter to BaseOperator to specify whether to consider deferred state as an active state when checking these two configurations.","created_at":"2023-10-01T20:38:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T09:08:14Z","closed_at":"2023-12-03T00:12:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efadcb1626214a489ba2e86f84e689bf5ffdfbf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

I took a look at the issue in `looker_sdk` and it didn't quite seem like the same thing.\r\n\r\nAfter digging in, I believe this is simply a typo in the hook's `get_looker_sdk()` method and the `40` was left off by mistake. Adding the `40` back on here fixes the issues in my local environment. I can't seem to find any reason it would be desirable to use `serialize.serialize` there, and in fact looker_sdk uses `serialize40` here.\r\n\r\nYou can see [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/blob/f7783890bbe7edaea58f7f849f494f6c9ed69df4/python/looker_sdk/__init__.py#L85) in the `looker_sdk` repo that during init we use `serialize.serialize40`, whereas in `LookerHook` we use `serialize.serialize`.\r\n\r\n`serialize.serialize` points [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/blob/f7783890bbe7edaea58f7f849f494f6c9ed69df4/python/looker_sdk/rtl/serialize.py#L78C2-L78C2), where it expects a `converter` to be passed in.\r\n\r\n`serialize.serialize40` points [here](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/blob/f7783890bbe7edaea58f7f849f494f6c9ed69df4/python/looker_sdk/rtl/serialize.py#L117C10-L117C10), where there is a default `converter` set.\r\n\r\nThis becomes problematic when you want to do something with the sdk from `LookerHook` when calling a method using `post`, like `create_query`.\r\n\r\nAn example - when we try to do something like this, we get an error due to the missing `converter`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\ndef example():\r\n  sdk = LookerHook(\"looker_conn\").get_looker_sdk()\r\n\r\n  query = sdk.create_query(\r\n    body=models.WriteQuery(\r\n      model=\"my_model\",\r\n      view=\"my_explore\",\r\n      fields=[\"field1\"],\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\nwith DAG(...) as dag:\r\n  PythonOperator(task_id=\"example\", python_callable=example)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis generates the error: `TypeError: serialize() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'converter'`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

User injects a callable as `pagination_function`. As long as this callable returns the parameters for a next call, the Operator keep calling the API (with the new parameters).\r\n- **Refactors the ~Simple~HttpOperator**:\r\n  - Rename it to `HttpOperator` and add a deprecated SimpleHttpOperator class\r\n  - Make it more modular, to facilitate the creation of other Operators on top of it\r\n  - Load the Hook based on the connection_id (like the BaseSQLOperator)\r\n\r\n#### Use case\r\nI do a lot of data pulling from APIs. The SimpleHttpOperator is a great tool for that, but:\r\n- I've faced an API which returns data in a paginated way, do not provide the number of pages, and send a cursor (random id) to paginate over. *Dynamic Tasks?*  I need to know in advance the number of pages. Which means calling the API two times, which is inefficient, and do not guarantee all pages are traversed during the second call.\r\n- For some exotic APIs, a custom HttpHook is nice to have (e.g to customize the Connection form, to pass multiple hidden string into custom auth_class, ...). Just like the SQLExecuteQueryOperator, I'd like to use the same HttpOperators which would load the right Hook based on the connection id.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.
