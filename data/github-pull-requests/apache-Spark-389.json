I converted `cars_iso-8859-1.csv` into `cars_utf-16.csv` as below:\n\n``` bash\niconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-16 < cars_iso-8859-1.csv > cars_utf-16.csv\n```\n\nand run the codes below:\n\n``` scala\nval cars = \"cars_utf-16.csv\"\nsqlContext.read\n  .format(\"csv\")\n  .option(\"charset\", \"utf-16\")\n  .option(\"delimiter\", 'þ')\n  .load(cars)\n  .show()\n```\n\nThis produces a wrong results

race condition can occur in MemoryStore's unrollSafely() method if two threads that\nreturn the same value for currentTaskAttemptId() execute this method concurrently. This\nchange makes the operation of reading the initial amount of unroll memory used, performing\nthe unroll, and updating the associated memory maps atomic in order to avoid this race\ncondition.\n\nInitial proposed fix wraps all of unrollSafely() in a memoryManager.synchronized { } block. A cleaner approach might be introduce a mechanism that synchronizes based on task attempt ID. An alternative option might be to track unroll/pending unroll memory based on block ID rather than task attempt ID.\n","created_at":"2016-02-02T01:17:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T03:37:03Z","closed_at":"2016-02-03T03:37:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58bf270d97b6672ebbd6f09e33f9b72e9588685c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5207fb4756dc563c27d8e71e6fa4a4d2dbcf24ba","head":{"label":"budde:master","ref":"master","sha":"5207fb4756dc563c27d8e71e6fa4a4d2dbcf24ba","user":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25752964,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc1Mjk2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"budde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/budde/spark","description":"Mirror

is a follow up to 9aadcffabd226557174f3ff566927f873c71672e that extends Spark SQL to allow users to _repeatedly_ optimize and execute structured queries.  A `ContinuousQuery` can be expressed using SQL, DataFrames or Datasets.  The purpose of this PR is only to add some initial infrastructure which will be extended in subsequent PRs.\n## User-facing API\n- `sqlContext.streamFrom` and `df.streamTo` return builder objects that are analogous to the `read/write` interfaces already available to executing queries in a batch-oriented fashion.\n- `ContinuousQuery` provides an interface for interacting with a query that is currently executing in the background.\n## Internal Interfaces\n- `StreamExecution` - executes streaming queries in micro-batches\n\nThe following are currently internal, but public APIs will be provided in a future release.\n- `Source` - an interface for providers of continually arriving data.  A source must have a notion of an `Offset` that monotonically tracks what data has arrived.  For fault tolerance, a source must be able to replay data given a start offset.\n- `Sink` - an interface that accepts the results of a continuously executing query.  Also responsible for tracking the offset that should be resumed from in the case of a failure.\n## Testing\n- `MemoryStream` and `MemorySink` - simple implementations of source and sink that keep all data in memory and have methods for simulating durability failures\n- `StreamTest` - a framework for performing actions and checking invariants on a continuous query\n","created_at":"2016-02-01T19:08:11Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T00:07:05Z","closed_at":"2016-02-02T18:15:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee8352eb1625dd2bf388db1c588b262628acd85d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/735e113dfd0a2eda60f01d8974c6f00df34c415f","head":{"label":"marmbrus:structured-streaming","ref":"structured-streaming","sha":"735e113dfd0a2eda60f01d8974c6f00df34c415f","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

currently use the Hive implementations for the `collect_list`/`collect_set` aggregate functions. This has a few major drawbacks, the use of HiveUDAF (which has quite a bit of overhead) and the lack of support for struct datatypes. This PR adds native implementation of these functions to Spark.\n\nThe size of the collected list/set vary, this means we cannot use the fast, Tungsten, aggregation path to perform the aggregation, and that we fallback to the slower sort based path. Another big problem with these operators is that when the size of the collected list/set grows too large, we can start experiencing large GC pauzes and OOMEs.\n\nThis PR implements these UDAFs as `ImperativeAggregate`s and uses a custom mutable `ArrayData` structure in order to efficiently collect the items. The current PR allows for partial aggregates, but I am not sure yet if we should support this.\n\nComments and feedback are appreciated.\n\ncc @yhuai

Spark 1.6 and earlier, Spark SQL does not support `NATURAL JOIN` queries. However, its SQL parser does not consider `NATURAL` to be a reserved word, which causes natural joins to be parsed as regular joins where the left table has been aliased. For instance,\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM foo NATURAL JOIN bar\n```\n\ngets interpreted as `foo JOIN bar` where `foo` is aliased to `natural`.\n\nRather than doing this, which leads to confusing / wrong results for users who expect NATURAL JOIN behavior, Spark should immediately reject these queries at analysis time and should provide an informative error message.\n\nThis patch is targeted at Spark 1.6 and earlier because Spark 2.0 will add NATURAL JOIN support.\n\nI chose to implement this check entirely within the parser in order to minimize the scope of the changes and to not introduce any new classes into the logical plan layer. I considered introducing a new `NaturalJoin` join type, parsing the query, then detecting and throwing an error from the analyzer but ended up rejecting this approach because I was concerned that adding a new class to a sealed trait would break compilation for third-party code which pattern-matches on Catalyst join types.\n","created_at":"2016-01-31T02:00:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-31T20:44:28Z","closed_at":"2016-01-31T20:42:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2fc7e968d98a45060383fe5039fca66700669e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21e42d893283a754f3d25758562864ceb57043d4","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-13105","ref":"SPARK-13105","sha":"21e42d893283a754f3d25758562864ceb57043d4","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

is the next iteration of @tnachen's previous PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4027\n\nIn that PR, we resolved with @andrewor14 and @pwendell to implement the Mesos scheduler's support of `spark.executor.cores` to be consistent with YARN and Standalone.  This PR implements that resolution.\n\nThis PR implements two high-level features.  These two features are co-dependent, so they're implemented both here:\n- Mesos support for spark.executor.cores\n- Multiple executors per slave\n\nWe at Mesosphere have been working with Typesafe on a Spark/Mesos integration test suite: https://github.com/typesafehub/mesos-spark-integration-tests, which passes for this PR.\n\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.

history server functionality from standalone Master.  Previously, the Master process rebuilt a SparkUI once the application was completed which sometimes caused problems, such as OOM, when the application event log is large (see SPARK-6270).  Keeping this functionality out of the Master will help to simplify the process and increase stability.\n\nTesting for this change included running core unit tests and manually running an application on a standalone cluster to verify that it completed successfully and that the Master UI functioned correctly.  Also added 2 unit tests to verify killing an application and driver from MasterWebUI makes the correct request to the Master.\n","created_at":"2016-01-29T22:50:02Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T15:47:57Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T21:31:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c4191640a2aae08f055f5103179df2e70ce6951","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1814a3a58a59f4bb51118c8992831d6909d4330","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:remove-history-master-SPARK-12299","ref":"remove-history-master-SPARK-12299","sha":"d1814a3a58a59f4bb51118c8992831d6909d4330","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

pull request creates an internal catalog API. The creation of this API is the first step towards consolidating SQLContext and HiveContext. I envision we will have two different implementations in Spark 2.0: (1) a simple in-memory implementation, and (2) an implementation based on the current HiveClient (ClientWrapper).\n\nI took a look at what Hive's internal metastore interface/implementation, and then created this API based on it. I believe this is the minimal set needed in order to achieve all the needed

issue is causing tests to fail consistently in master with Hadoop 2.6 / 2.7. This is because for Hadoop 2.5+ we overwrite existing values of `InputMetrics#bytesRead` in each call to `HadoopRDD#compute`. In the case of coalesce, e.g.\n\n```\nsc.textFile(..., 4).coalesce(2).count()\n```\n\nwe will call `compute` multiple times in the same task, overwriting `bytesRead` values from previous calls to `compute`.\n\nFor a regression test, see `InputOutputMetricsSuite.input metrics for old hadoop with coalesce`. I did not add a new regression test because it's impossible without significant refactoring; there's a lot of existing duplicate code in this corner of Spark.\n\nThis was caused by #10835.\n","created_at":"2016-01-29T02:43:59Z","updated_at":"2016-01-30T02:06:47Z","closed_at":"2016-01-30T02:04:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ee7ffed0376571021307620012c360034a140ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5a97fcf3cc3e827eb9067abdc24d0d7fbe1f76c","head":{"label":"andrewor14:fix-input-metrics-coalesce","ref":"fix-input-metrics-coalesce","sha":"c5a97fcf3cc3e827eb9067abdc24d0d7fbe1f76c","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

For example, the listener gets the `internal.metrics.shuffleRead.remoteBlocksFetched`, which is an Int, then it proceeds to cast the Int to a Long, which fails.\n\nThe fix is to mark accumulators representing SQL metrics using some internal metadata. Then we can identify which ones are SQL metrics and only process those in the `SQLHistoryListener`.\n","created_at":"2016-01-28T23:42:21Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T00:46:21Z","closed_at":"2016-01-29T21:46:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aeea6a46a8c4d5533bc11edcb2a6fda599d0cb45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6f41d11de7c91cb3297face914b764361e6a7b5","head":{"label":"andrewor14:fix-sql-history","ref":"fix-sql-history","sha":"c6f41d11de7c91cb3297face914b764361e6a7b5","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

were ignored because they are incorrectly written; they don't actually trigger stage retries, which is what the tests are testing. These tests are now rewritten to induce stage retries through fetch failures.\n\nNote: there were 2 tests before and now there's only 1. What happened? It turns out that the case where we only resubmit a subset of of the original missing partitions is very difficult to simulate in tests without potentially introducing flakiness. This is because the `DAGScheduler` removes all map outputs associated with a given executor when this happens, and we will need multiple executors to trigger this case, and sometimes the scheduler still removes map outputs from all executors.\n","created_at":"2016-01-28T18:48:04Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T18:46:36Z","closed_at":"2016-02-04T18:36:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c641792806ee69eda44f04541cde6e8f3ffa1960","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13727669abef2f8f4403236b470ca63e1ee92f4a","head":{"label":"andrewor14:unignore-accum-test","ref":"unignore-accum-test","sha":"13727669abef2f8f4403236b470ca63e1ee92f4a","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

@yhuai @marmbrus @cloud-fan : Hello All, I tried to run the failing query with PR 10678 from Spark-12705, still got the same failure. \n\nActually for this jira problem, I can recreate it without using order by and window function. It just needs select a column with aliases and aggregate function , group by with the aliases. \n\nthe query looks like below:\n\nselect a  r, sum(b) s FROM testData2 GROUP BY r\n\n(if I replace r in the group by with a, it will work)\n\nI think this jira is different than Xiao's jira. \n\nFor this Jira, it looks like the Aliases  in the Group By clause (r)  can't be resolved in the rule ResolveReferences. \n\nCurrently, the ResolveReferences only deal with the aggregate function if the argument contains Stars, so for other aggregate function, it falls into this case: case q: LogicalPlan , and it will try to resolve it in the child. In this case, the group by contains alias r, the child is LogicalRDD contains column a and b, that is why we can't find r in the child.\n\nHere is the plan looks like.\n\nplan = {Aggregate@9173} \"'Aggregate ['r], [a#4 AS r#43,(sum(cast(b#5 as bigint)),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS s#44L]\\n+- Subquery testData2\\n   +- LogicalRDD [a#4,b#5], MapPartitionsRDD[5] at beforeAll at BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:187\\n\"\n groupingExpressions = {$colon$colon@9176} \"::\" size = 1\n  (0)  = {UnresolvedAttribute@9190} \"'r\"\n aggregateExpressions = {$colon$colon@9177} \"::\" size = 2\n  (0)  = {Alias@9110} \"a#4 AS r#43\"\n  (1)  = {Alias@9196} \"(sum(cast(b#5 as bigint)),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS s#44L\"\n child = {Subquery@7456} \"Subquery testData2\\n+- LogicalRDD [a#4,b#5], MapPartitionsRDD[5] at beforeAll at BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:187\\n\"\n  alias = {String@9201} \"testData2\"\n  child = {LogicalRDD@9202} \"LogicalRDD [a#4,b#5], MapPartitionsRDD[5] at beforeAll at BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:187\\n\"\n  _analyzed = false\n  resolved = true\n  cleanArgs = null\n  org$apache$spark$Logging$$log_ = null\n  bitmap$0 = 1\n  schema = null\n  bitmap$0 = false\n  origin = {Origin@9203} \"Origin(Some(1),Some(27))\"\n  containsChild = {Set$Set1@9204} \"Set$Set1\" size = 1\n  bitmap$0 = true\n resolved = false\n bitmap$0 = true\n _analyzed = false\n resolved = false\n\nthe proposal fix is that we create another case for aggregate function, if there is unresolved attribute in the groupingExpressions, and all the attributes are resolved in the aggregateExpressions, we will search the unresolved attribute in the aggregateExpressions first. \n\nThanks for reviewing.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12989\n\nIn the rule `ExtractWindowExpressions`, we simply replace alias by the corresponding attribute. However, this will cause an issue exposed by the following case:\n\n``` scala\nval data = Seq((\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 3), (\"c\", \"b\", \"a\", 3)).toDF(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"num\")\n  .withColumn(\"Data\", struct(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"))\n  .drop(\"A\")\n  .drop(\"B\")\n  .drop(\"C\")\n\nval winSpec = Window.partitionBy(\"Data.A\", \"Data.B\").orderBy($\"num\".desc)\ndata.select($\"*\", max(\"num\").over(winSpec) as \"max\").explain(true)\n```\n\nIn this case, both `Data.A` and `Data.B` are `alias` in `WindowSpecDefinition`. If we replace these alias expression by their alias names, we are unable to know what they are since they will not be put in `missingExpr` too.

off, many thanks and credit to @nikit-os for starting this work. I am building up on his good work done at #10681.\n\nHere is some context: Kafka has a new consumer API starting Apache Kafka 0.9 (Kafka 0.9.0.0, to be precise). This API supports security features like authentication (via Kerberos) and encryption (via SSL). This new API is in beta but is the only way we can integrate Spark and Kafka in a secure environment.\n\nKafka 0.9 ships with both the new and old consumer API. So, we can up our dependency of Kafka from 0.8\\* to 0.9.  However, the old consumer API in Kafka 0.9 is binary incompatible with the old consumer API in Kafka 0.8_. There are also some minor API compatibility issues between the old API of Kafka 0.8._ and Kafka 0.9, mostly around ZkClient and ZkUtils API. In almost all cases, when users are using the old API whether they are using Kafka 0.8 or Kafka 0.9 with Spark, they won't have to modify any code on their side. It's only when they use the _new_ consumer API from Kafka 0.9, they will have to modify their code.\n\nIn addition to supporting to the new API from Kafka 0.9, we can support the old API from Kafka 0.8 only (which works with Kafka 0.8 and Kafka 0.9 brokers), or old API from Kafka 0.9 (which only works with Kafka 0.9 brokers). If we support the old API from 0.8.0, we complicate our integration. We will have to build 2 artifacts (kafka-assembly jars, that is), one for Kafka 0.8 and Kafka 0.9. We'll have to do maven profiles, one for Kafka 0.8 and one for 0.9. Alternatively, if we only support old API from 0.9, users will have upgrade Kafka brokers to 0.9, when using Spark 2.0.\n\nIn fact, users should ideally upgrade Kafka brokers before they upgrade Spark since old 0.8.0 clients can work with the new 0.9.0 brokers). I am personally ok with requiring users to upgrade Kafka brokers to 0.9.0 since 1) this is going in Spark 2.0, 2) that's what the Kafka community is pushing for, 3) I think the baggage of supporting Kafka 0.8's old consumer API might be too much to carry until another major release of Spark. Again, with Kafka 0.9's old consumer API, which we support, no user code needs to be changed, they do need to upgrade their brokers though.\n\nAs far as the code in this PR goes, we decided to put code for the new API in a new package (called org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka.newapi*), creating a separate maven artifact spark-streaming-kafka-newapi_2.10.\n\nIn essence, this means that there are two KafkaCluster classes and two KafkaUtils classes, etc. (similar to how we have NewHadoopRDD) because there wasn't enough duplication between the two implementations. Where there was enough duplication, example KafkaTestUtils, there is only one implementation.\n\nI'd love to get this reviewed. Thanks in advance!\n\nThe examples of the new API have some extra required parameters, I will change it shortly for them to have reasonable defaults and be optional. \n\nFollow on work:\n- This is only scala/java implementation. I am working on and currently testing a python implementation in a separate branch at https://github.com/markgrover/spark/tree/kafka09-integration-python I want to get this PR out and committed first. It'll also help me gather feedback sooner than later.\n- Add and test authentication with kerberos. For that, we need delegation tokens in Kafka (which is currently unresolved: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1696). This is because, especially in the case of DirectStream, all executors can consume from Kafka brokers and initializing credentials at each executor can been seen as a DoS attack by the Ticket Granting server.\n- Encryption exists in this patch but I haven't spent much time integration testing it. If folks prefer, taking that out until I have gotten a chance to integration test it on my own cluster, I am open to that. It's only a few lines and a test that needs to be taken out.\n","created_at":"2016-01-27T20:32:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T22:29:10Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T22:29:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61a410a44bb62d399036e50ad65f41409eec1156","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/229b773f9c5c894088a29937f241ad0db48991ba","head":{"label":"markgrover:kafka09-integration","ref":"kafka09-integration","sha":"229b773f9c5c894088a29937f241ad0db48991ba","user":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17418333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQxODMzMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"markgrover/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12850\n\nThis PR is to support bucket pruning when the predicates are `EqualTo`, `EqualNullSafe`, `IsNull`, `In`, and `InSet`. \n\nLike HIVE, in this PR, the bucket pruning works when the bucketing key has one and only one column.\n\nSo far, I do not find a way to verify how many buckets are actually scanned. However, I did verify it when doing the debug. Could you provide a suggestion how to do it properly? Thank you! @cloud-fan @yhuai @rxin @marmbrus \n\nBTW, we can add more cases to support complex predicate including `Or` and `And`. Please let me know if I should do it in this PR.\n\nMaybe we also need to add test cases to verify if bucket pruning works well for each data type.

of SPARK-12834 for branch-1.6\n\nOriginal PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10772\n\nOriginal commit message:\nWe use `SerDe.dumps()` to serialize `JavaArray` and `JavaList` in `PythonMLLibAPI`, then deserialize them with `PickleSerializer` in Python side. However, there is no need to transform them in such an inefficient way. Instead of it, we can use type conversion to convert them, e.g. `list(JavaArray)` or `list(JavaList)`. What's more, there is an issue to Ser/De Scala Array as I said in

is a bug that appears while fitting a Logistic Regression model with and `setFitIntercept(false)`. If the data matrix has one column with identical value, the resulting model is often not correct. Specifically, the special column will always get a weight of 0, due to the logic that checks columns with std=0. However, the correct solution, which is unique for L2 logistic regression, usually has non-zero weight.\n\nThe fix is to update the special handing logic to make it compatible with columns that has 0 variance.\n\nTwo unit tests are included in this PR where one of them is for review only. I'll remove it if this is going to be merged.\n\ncc @mengxr @dbtsai

It ends up creating MetastoreRelation which does not have ORC PPD. Purpose of this JIRA is to convert MetastoreRelation to OrcRelation in HiveMetastoreCatalog, so that users can benefit from PPD even when connecting to spark-thrift server.\nFor e.g, Query \"select count(1) from  tpch_flat_orc_1000.lineitem where l_shipdate = '1990-04-18'\" which is fired against spark-thrift-server or sqlContext would end up using \"OrcRelation\" to make use of PPD instead of

`changed_modules`.\n","created_at":"2016-01-26T23:56:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T16:35:18Z","closed_at":"2016-01-27T16:33:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b82962d41e7f6fc40cebfa9f5e5db12b852dc563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2799788be7fc161ca0cce5e32f9168e61f0e3609","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:build-module-fix","ref":"build-module-fix","sha":"2799788be7fc161ca0cce5e32f9168e61f0e3609","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

`Partition` and `RDD.partitions` APIs have a contract which requires custom implementations of `RDD.partitions` to ensure that for all `x`, `rdd.partitions(x).index == x`; in other words, the `index` reported by a repartition needs to match its position in the partitions array.\n\nIf a custom RDD implementation violates this contract, then Spark has the potential to become stuck in an infinite recomputation loop when recomputing a subset of an RDD's partitions, since the tasks that are actually run will not correspond to the missing output partitions that triggered the recomputation. Here's a link to a notebook which demonstrates this problem: https://rawgit.com/JoshRosen/e520fb9a64c1c97ec985/raw/5e8a5aa8d2a18910a1607f0aa4190104adda3424/Violating%2520RDD.partitions%2520contract.html\n\nIn order to guard against this infinite loop behavior, this patch modifies Spark so that it fails fast and refuses to compute RDDs' whose `partitions` violate the API contract.\n","created_at":"2016-01-26T23:31:50Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T21:30:01Z","closed_at":"2016-01-27T21:29:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d28cf5e6511c88ff0a5e8a89a5f5dc636ed93677","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/10932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/10932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0dd1e793cae7e7795f3afce349483602b98a286","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-13021","ref":"SPARK-13021","sha":"a0dd1e793cae7e7795f3afce349483602b98a286","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

is to fix a long-time annoyance: Whenever we add a new algorithm to pyspark.ml, we have to add it to the `__all__` list at the top.  Since we keep it alphabetized, it often creates a lot more changes than needed.  It is also easy to add the Estimator and forget the Model.
