SUMMARY\r\nThis is a continuation of #23888 and addresses two issues that were identified after this PR was merged:\r\n- On MySQL, large key-value entries that had been persisted prior to #20385 and exceeded the column size would cause the migration to fail, as the pickled value was truncated. This checks for truncation errors during deserialization, and replaces the value with an empty dict to ensure that the value is deserializable in the future.\r\n- Deserializing Explore permalinks failed, as one of the values in the dict was a string Enum that hadn't been cast to a pure `str` (apparently my devenv didn't have a single Explore permalink when I ran the migration üôÅ). For this reason we add a check to `find_class` to make sure `superset.utils.core.DatasourceType` is a valid class. Note that this problem will now go away, as the JSON codec ensures that the Enum becomes a simple string in the future. In addition and to be more explicit, we cast `datasourceType` in the Explore payload of the create command to a `str` which is the correct type based on the `ExplorePermalinkValue` type: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d96b72d46fe6e7b8a0a4749032c13322396633e1/superset/explore/permalink/types.py#L25-L34\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. downgrade your devenv to `7e67aecbf3f1`, checkout master prior to `f1fa1a733d247ec4793c17b69c4eb40c631c5080`  and create an Explore permalink\r\n2. checkout latest master branch, run `superset db upgrade` and notice the error\r\n3. checkout this PR, rerun `superset db upgrade` and see the migration complete\r\n4. To validate that downgrading and re-upgrading works, run `superset db downgrade 7e67aecbf3f1 && superset db upgrade\"\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen invoking `super` we shouldn't explicitly be specifying the `MySQLEngineSpec` for the `type` and `object_or_type` arguments as there's no guarantee that the `MySQLEngineSpec` class is the class which gets instantiated, i.e., this could serve as a base class for another connector such as a custom StarRocks connector.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the current implementation is if you provide logic of the following, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass StarRocksEngineSpec(MySQLEngineSpec):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    The StarRocks engine specification.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    disallow_uri_query_params = set()\r\n    enforce_uri_query_params = {}\r\n    engine = \"starrocks\"\r\n    engine_name = \"StarRocks\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen `adjust_engine_params` is invoked it's using the `MySQLEnginSpec.enforce_uri_query_params` et al. class level parameters. Simply invoking `super` without parameters resolves this issue.\r\n\r\nI grokked the entire engine specs and made sure that all `super` calls were of the form `super()` which mean updating the Ocient connector as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdd codeQL to our CI workflow.\r\n\r\n> CodeQL is the code analysis engine developed by GitHub to automate security checks. You can analyze your code using CodeQL and display the results as code scanning alerts.\r\n\r\nMain docs: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security\r\n\r\nWill perform python code scanning when:\r\n- A PR is merged to master\r\n- A PR is opened -> Results for the PR are available to everyone as annotations \r\n- Daily at 04:00am -> Results are only available to repo writers\r\n\r\nFor Pull requests:\r\nIf you have read permission for a repository, you can see annotations on pull requests. With write permission, you can see detailed information and resolve code scanning alerts for that repository.\r\n\r\nHeres an example from a test PR:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"917\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 14 23 34\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/236469416-2869ee69-dd20-468c-83d6-b42246bfa0e7.png\">\r\n\r\nList of common weakness detection: https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python-cwe/\r\n\r\nThis will work as a trial, if may be proven unproductive to have codeQL enabled for every PR. So disabling for PR's or further tweaking will probably be needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

`[Presto|Trino]EngineSpec._partition_query` functions provide arguments for both the schema and table name, however the later can include the schema‚Äîin the case when invoked from the `extra_table_metadata` method‚Äîwhich is somewhat confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes said logic ensuring that the `table_name` only includes the table name (which is guaranteed from the various calling endpoints [[1](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b7689fbe539038e939b6ae9a59855d131dc2b963/superset/databases/api.py#L699-L760),

method.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes the Multiple Line Charts.\r\n\r\n- Removes the legacy chart code and unregisters the plugin.\r\n- Removes old plugin references throughout the codebase\r\n- Updates unit tests\r\n- Updates E2E tests\r\n- Updates the example dashboards\r\n- Updates translation files\r\n\r\nThe Multiple Line Charts description says that it's deprecated and people should use the Mixed chart instead. The problem is that Multiple Line Charts allows you to select 2 charts which may reference different datasets while Mixed Chart only allows 1 dataset. This means that to compare values from different datasets using a Mixed chart you would need to create another dataset combining the source datasets. Given that this chart is marked as deprecated for a long time, a migration would required significant effort, and its adoption is pretty low, we decided to remove it. If someone still has this chart and tries to access it, the following screen will be displayed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1776\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 09 58 54\"

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR splits `Service` resource definitions into separate files according to Helm [Best Practices Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/#structure-of-templates):\r\n> - Each resource definition should be in its own template file.\r\n\r\nAlso `service-account.yaml` renamed to `serviceaccount.yaml` according to:\r\n> - Template file names should use dashed notation

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes the base migration class so that if `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled when migrating a chart, the temporal filter will be created for the new viz type. It also fixes an issue where renaming a key was not deleting the old key and ensures that the `form_data` backup is a deep copy of the original `form_data`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [

As a result, users may accidentally click the stop button, causing unintended interruption of the query's execution.\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes to modify the color of the stop button to make it more distinct from the run button during query execution. By doing so, it will be easier for users to differentiate between the two buttons and avoid accidentally clicking the stop button, thereby preventing unintentional interruption of the query's execution.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAs part of this PR, we have also updated the explore view's stop button icon, to match it with sql lab stop button icon, for the sake of consistency.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nSince the permalink and app resources were already using simple primitive types that serialize well with `json.dumps`, we don't really need to use `pickle` to serialize them. Therefore, to simplify the main key-value resources, we replace pickle with json where applicable. However, the metastore cache will still use `pickle`, as it needs to be able to handle arbitrary binary types. This should be ok, as it's opt-in, so it won't be enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo test this permalinks were created on master branch, the branch checked out, the database migrated, and the permalinks validated to work as before.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWith `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` enabled we're producing queries that are invalid for Dremio, eg:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', pickup_date) AS pickup_date,\r\n       COUNT(*)\r\nFROM \"reporting\".\"nyc_trips_weather\"\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', pickup_date)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because Dremio gets confused by the alias `pickup_date` and the actual column `pickup_date`.\r\n\r\nThe solution I found was to turn off projection aliases for Dremio.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe often to update(add) the useEffect dependencies to fix the dependency warnings (i.e. #22974)\r\nThis work has potential performance degrade issue.\r\n\r\nFor example, #22974 updated the following useEffect dependancies. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/097f47519433aa7892f1993a33afb3e0a12296a4/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor/index.jsx#L382-L397\r\n\r\nThis means `setHeight` and window event allocation can be triggered anytime handleWindowResizeWithThrottle/onBeforeUnload or/and updated.\r\n\r\nThe problem is `onBeforeUnload` also has dependancies by useCallback \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/097f47519433aa7892f1993a33afb3e0a12296a4/superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor/index.jsx#L365-L380\r\n\r\nSo whenever database is updated or latestQuery state updated, the above useEffect triggers the additional setHeight(which triggers re-rendering) and new event allocation (no memory leaked but unnecessary addEventListener/removeEventListener operation triggered)\r\n\r\nThis is common issue on react useEffect usage, so there's an official solution (useEffectEvent) is introduced.\r\nFor more detail, please check [the blog link /w video clip](https://morioh.com/p/994ce3afc1d3) or [official proposal document](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/useevent/text/0000-useevent.md)\r\n\r\n**FYI: currently eslint rule of exhaustive-deps related to useEffectEvent is [under experimental](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/25881), this commit uses use-event-callback to avoid the warning**\r\n\r\nIn addition to introduce the useEffectEvent, this commit also tune up L365-L380 to avoid the unnecessary setHeight triggered during database is updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nResize sqllab editor to verify the query panel height adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nSome legacy charts (e.g. Heatmap and Bar Chart) were not getting dashboard time range filters applied with GENERIC_CHART_AXES enabled. This PR manually converts the time range into an adhoc filter, similarly how it's done for v1 charts.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR brings back the time section for Calendar Heatmap chart, which was broken without it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/235162705-66399bd0-018f-4b63-bcae-24c7b13893f9.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1686\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/235162781-f6b90ff6-828d-41dd-8a0c-13678ccd53e3.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

failing ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/4823298353/jobs/8591610034?pr=23832)) as `SELECT` statements do not guarantee deterministic ordering unless an `ORDER BY` clause is used. It's unclear why these unit tests are failing somewhat consistently now, though it _might_ be due to a non-deterministic file ordering when adding files to a zip file.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR deprecates the `superset/warm_up_cache` endpoint and creates the `api/v1/charts/warm_up_cache` and `api/v1/dataset/warm_up_cache` endpoints to replace it.\r\n\r\nThe new endpoint has the following key differences:\r\n* Follows command pattern\r\n* uses `PUT` instead of `GET`\r\n* accepts a json body validated by marshmallow instead of query params\r\n* added openapi spec\r\n\r\nAlso improves test coverage\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

the join clause;\r\nand then we change our database to clickhouse, but the sql changed with same filters\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT DATE(date) AS __timestamp,\r\n       movie_title AS movie_title,\r\n       sum(uv) AS `SUM(uv)`\r\nFROM movie\r\nINNER JOIN\r\n  (SELECT movie_title AS movie_title__,\r\n          sum(uv) AS mme_inner__\r\n   FROM movie\r\n   WHERE time_type =

join clause\r\n\r\nif change the ```time_groupby_inline``` to True, it works as mysql engine \r\n\r\nso we  want this flag   True , because If we have several years of data in our table, it will error .\r\n\r\noh, i find that this question is unrelated to that issue Ôºåsorry about this and I have changed the

SUMMARY\r\nMany of our stories in Storybook are throwing errors. After intensive investigation and the help of `git bisect`, I was able track the inclusion of `storybook-addon-mock` dependency in #23429 as the root cause for the errors. I investigated for a couple of hours to understand the reason why it was generating the errors but I wasn't able to resolve the issue. During the investigation I found that there is an [open issue](https://github.com/linearlabs-workspace/storybook-addon-mock/issues/139) with the addon that also need to be addressed. Given that this is affecting many stories, this PR reverts that dependency to give us time to further investigate the problem without blocking Storybook development.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `clickhouse-connect` library `0.4.1` did not handle a `no_proxy` environment variable. This is eventually problematic when using the [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose) in an environment that requires a forward proxy (e.g., in an enterprise environment) and where Clickhouse should be used as a database. In such case the call to the database should remain inside the docker network to allow addressing the database via its container name. Calls to external data sources should be rerouted via the forward proxy. Version `0.4.1` handles all connections via the proxy and thus misses the local network connection inside docker network and thus eventually fails host name resolution, given the forward proxy sits outside the docker network and is not aware of the inside docker network container names.\r\n\r\nThe issue has been fixed in the `clickhouse-connect` library in version `0.5.19` via [#PR163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect/issues/163), hence bumping version here in the superset docs accordingly.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n* Follow the [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-using-docker-compose)\r\n* Follow the existing [Clickhouse Installation Guide](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/clickhouse) referencing version `0.4.1`\r\n* Add a clickhouse container named `clickhouse` to `docker-compose-non-dev.yml`, e.g.:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  x-clickhouse-volumes:\r\n    &clickhouse-volumes\r\n    - clickhouse_home:/var/lib/clickhouse\r\n\r\n  clickhouse:\r\n    image: clickhouse/clickhouse-server:23\r\n    container_name: clickhouse\r\n    env_file: .env\r\n    user: \"root\"\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"8123:8123\"\r\n      - \"9003:9000\"\r\n    volumes: *clickhouse-volumes\r\n\r\n  volumes:\r\n    clickhouse_home:\r\n      external: false\r\n  ```\r\n* Update `docker/.env` to contain `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` environment variables, e.g.:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  # Local Proxy Settings\r\n  http_proxy=\"http://host.docker.internal:8888\"\r\n  https_proxy=\"http://host.docker.internal:8888\"\r\n  no_proxy=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,db,redis,superset,superset-init,superset-worker,superset-beat,clickhouse\"\r\n  ```\r\n* Provide the forward proxy on the host OS (e.g., Fiddler - in above example on port 8888)\r\n* Start all containers and log in to superset\r\n* Try to add Clickhouse database via connection string `clickhousedb://clickhouse/default`\r\n\r\nThe connection will fail. See eventually logs in the ¬¥superset_app` container. Superset UI shows an error message on the dialog with the connection string, but not on the one where you provide host, port etc. in separate fields.\r\n\r\n* Change `docker/requirements-local.txt` to contain new version `clickhouse-connect>=0.5.19`\r\n* Repeat the test to add the database and all works\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is
