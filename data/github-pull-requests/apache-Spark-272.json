What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe invalidate table relation once table data is changed by [SPARK-21237](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21237).

`table.stats.isEmpty`):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/07c4b9bd1fb055f283af076b2a995db8f6efe7a5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/command/CommandUtils.scala#L44-L54\r\n\r\nThis will introduce some issues, e.g. [SPARK-19784](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19784), [SPARK-19845](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19845),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently spark webui doesn't have an option of auto refresh page. Because of this, user has to reload\r\nevery time to see the updates in the page. \r\n\r\nFor SQL page and Streaming page, currently we are passing the refresh interval, but it is not implemented in the 'headerSparkPage' method. This PR, added the refresh functionality to the webui.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-13

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we compare attributes, in general, we should always refer to semantic equality, as the default `equal` method can return false when there are \"cosmetic\" differences between them, but still they are the same thing; at least we have to consider them so when analyzing/optimizing queries.\r\n\r\nThe PR focuses on the usage and comparison of the `output` of a `LogicalPlan`, which is a `Seq[Attribute]` in `AliasViewChild`. In this case, using equality implicitly fails to check the semantic equality. This results in the operator failing to stabilize.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nrunning the tests with the patch provided by @maryannxue in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAvro schema allows recursive reference, e.g. the schema for linked-list in https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html#schema_record\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"name\": \"LongList\",\r\n  \"aliases\": [\"LinkedLongs\"],                      // old name for this\r\n  \"fields\" : [\r\n    {\"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"long\"},             // each element has a long\r\n    {\"name\": \"next\", \"type\": [\"null\", \"LongList\"]} // optional next element\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn current Spark SQL, it is impossible to convert the schema as `StructType` . Run `SchemaConverters.toSqlType(avroSchema)` and we will get stack overflow exception.\r\n\r\nWe should detect the recursive reference and throw exception for it.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test case.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-12T15:22:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T06:54:10Z","closed_at":"2018-10-13T06:54:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e380bd5f0cf852547863b79c937a0f469398fb81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c97f54347cf08edfa1f31ab7026700170a67c848","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:avroRecursiveRef","ref":"avroRecursiveRef","sha":"c97f54347cf08edfa1f31ab7026700170a67c848","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|count(1)|\r\n+--------+\r\n|     100|\r\n+--------+\r\n\r\n+--------+\r\n|count(1)|\r\n+--------+\r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges to core allow for a K8S to pass a SparkConf specifying whether the `obtainDelegationTokens()` logic fetches `renewalInterval` (as in some uses cases where the DT renewal may be external to Spark i.e. K8s Cluster Mode) and whether this renewal interval calculation is done by retrieving a second DT, as YARN does. \r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we try run\r\n```\r\n./start-history-server.sh -h\r\n```\r\nWe will get such error\r\n```\r\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: File -h does not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. This is not User-Friendly.  For option `-h` or `--help`, it should be parsed correctly and show the usage of the class/script.\r\n2. We can remove deprecated options for setting event log directory through command line options.\r\n\r\nAfter fix, we can get following output:\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./sbin/start-history-server.sh [options]\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --properties-file FILE      Path to a custom Spark properties file.\r\n                              Default is conf/spark-defaults.conf.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options can be set by setting the corresponding JVM system property.\r\nHistory Server options are always available; additional options depend on the provider.\r\n\r\nHistory Server options:\r\n\r\n  spark.history.ui.port              Port where server will listen for connections\r\n                                     (default 18080)\r\n  spark.history.acls.enable          Whether to enable view acls for all applications\r\n                                     (default false)\r\n  spark.history.provider             Name of history provider class (defaults to\r\n                                     file system-based provider)\r\n  spark.history.retainedApplications Max number of application UIs to keep loaded in memory\r\n                                     (default 50)\r\nFsHistoryProvider options:\r\n\r\n  spark.history.fs.logDirectory      Directory where app logs are stored\r\n                                     (default: file:/tmp/spark-events)\r\n  spark.history.fs.updateInterval    How often to reload log data from storage\r\n                                     (in seconds, default: 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `Range` reports metrics in batch granularity. This is acceptable, but it's better if we can make it row granularity without performance penalty.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR,  the metrics are updated when preparing the batch, which is before we actually consume data. In this PR, the metrics are updated after the data are consumed. There are 2 different cases:\r\n1. The data processing loop has a stop check. The metrics are updated when we need to stop.\r\n2. no stop check. The metrics are updated after the loop.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests and a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to partially revert https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5fef6e3513d6023a837c427d183006d153c7102b so that it does make a readsupport and read schema when it writes in branch 2-4 since it's too breaking change.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5fef6e3513d6023a837c427d183006d153c7102b happened to create a readsupport in write path, which ended up with reading schema from readsupport at write path.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this breaks `spark.range(1).format(\"source\").write.save(\"non-existent-path\")` case since there's no way to read the schema from \"non-existent-path\".\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22009#discussion_r223982672\r\nSee also

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen determine table statistics, if the `totalSize` of the table is not defined, we fallback to HDFS to get the table statistics when `spark.sql.statistics.fallBackToHdfs` is `true`, otherwise the default value(`spark.sql.defaultSizeInBytes`) will be taken, which will lead to tables without `totalSize` property may not be broadcast(Except parquet). \r\n\r\nFortunately, in most case the data is written into the table by a insertion command which will save the data-size in metastore, so it's possible to use metastore to calculate the table statistics.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T06:57:02Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T07:42:39Z","closed_at":"2018-11-05T12:05:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a13703b4c870f3bf681c970093006f1cb91e34b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e610477063b4f326b8261d59b55abce83cbb82e7","head":{"label":"fjh100456:StatisticCommit","ref":"StatisticCommit","sha":"e610477063b4f326b8261d59b55abce83cbb82e7","user":{"login":"fjh100456","id":26785576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg1NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26785576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456","html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115198070,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTUxOTgwNzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"fjh100456/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fjh100456","id":26785576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg1NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26785576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456","html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjh100456/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fjh100456/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we enable event log compression and compression codec as 'zstd', we are unable to open the webui of the running application from the history server page. \r\nThe reason is that, Replay listener was unable to read from the zstd compressed eventlog due to the zstd frame was not finished yet. This causes truncated error while reading the eventLog. \r\n\r\nSo, when we try to open the WebUI from the History server page, it throws \"truncated error \", and we never able to open running application in the webui, when we enable zstd compression.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, when the IO excpetion happens, and if it is a running application, we  log the error,\r\n\"Failed to read Spark event log: evetLogDirAppName.inprogress\", instead of throwing exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest steps:\r\n1)spark.eventLog.compress =  true\r\n2)spark.io.compression.codec = zstd \r\n3)restart history server\r\n4) launch bin/spark-shell\r\n5) run some queries\r\n6) Open history server page\r\n7) click on the application\r\n\r\n**Before fix:**\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-10 23-52-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/46757387-9b4fa580-cce7-11e8-96ad-8938400483ed.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-10 23-52-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/46757393-a0145980-cce7-11e8-8cb0-44b583dde648.png)\r\n\r\n**After fix:**\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-10 23-43-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/46756971-6858e200-cce6-11e8-946c-0bffebb2cfba.png)\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-10 23-44-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/46756981-6d1d9600-cce6-11e8-95ea-ff8339a2fdfd.png)\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid to make a readsupport and read schema when it writes in other save modes.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5fef6e3513d6023a837c427d183006d153c7102b happened to create a readsupport in write path, which ended up with reading schema from readsupport at write path.\r\n\r\nThis breaks `spark.range(1).format(\"source\").write.save(\"non-existent-path\")` case since there's no way to read the schema from \"non-existent-path\".\r\n\r\nSee also

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, in ParquetFilters, predicates inside `Not` operator are considered as unable to perform partial push down.\r\nHowever, the following cases is still possible for push down:\r\n1. `Not(Or(left, right))` can be conversed as `And(Not(left), Not(right))`\r\n2. `Not(Not(pred))` can be conversed as `pred`\r\n\r\nBoth cases should be quite trivial, since the `Not` operator should be pushed down by optimization rule `BooleanSimplification` already.\r\nBut I think it should be good to handle such cases in Parquet data source module as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-10T09:57:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T13:40:05Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T12:35:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ae5e7445e3febe27e54cf6f3695405366d63c83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f43db656c3567ab7f8b711c8f0b27b16caa4bf7","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:parquetNotFilters","ref":"parquetNotFilters","sha":"0f43db656c3567ab7f8b711c8f0b27b16caa4bf7","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid to make a readsupport and read schema when it writes in other save modes.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5fef6e3513d6023a837c427d183006d153c7102b happened to create a readsupport in write path, which ended up with reading schema from readsupport at write path.\r\n\r\nThis breaks `spark.range(1).format(\"source\").write.save(\"non-existent-path\")` case since there's no way to read the schema from \"non-existent-path\".\r\n\r\nSee also

They work fine in single line mode because the line separation is done by Hadoop, which can handle all the different types of line separators. This PR fixes it by enabling Univocity's line separator detection in multiline mode, which will detect '\\r\\n', '\\r', or '\\n' automatically as it is done by hadoop in single line mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test with a file with crlf line endings.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-09T17:49:52Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T17:51:17Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T17:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a613326a690482b1c2c09aae3c5041c68ac924e","head":{"label":"palantir:palantirspark/fix-clrf-multiline","ref":"palantirspark/fix-clrf-multiline","sha":"1a613326a690482b1c2c09aae3c5041c68ac924e","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Move `CSVDataSource.makeSafeHeader` to `CSVUtils.makeSafeHeader` (as is).\r\n\r\n    - Historically and at the first place of refactoring (which I did), I intended to put all CSV specific handling (like options), filtering, extracting header, etc.\r\n\r\n    - See `JsonDataSource`. Now `CSVDataSource` is quite consistent with `JsonDataSource`. Since CSV's code path is quite complicated, we might better match them as possible as we can.\r\n\r\n2. Create `CSVHeaderChecker` and put `enforceSchema` logics into that.\r\n\r\n    - The checking header and column pruning stuff were added (per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20894 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21296) but some of codes such as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22123 are duplicated\r\n\r\n    - Also, checking header code is basically here and there. We better put them in a single place, which was quite error-prone. See (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22656).\r\n\r\n3. Move `CSVDataSource.checkHeaderColumnNames` to `CSVHeaderChecker.checkHeaderColumnNames` (as is).\r\n\r\n    - Similar reasons above with 1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this.","created_at":"2018-10-09T07:55:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:41:57Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T01:20:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04eee24a22434e6b7d93727f420ce4921aa6434e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c504356b847e183f571a09ce5f808d4a7f229255","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:refactoring-csv","ref":"refactoring-csv","sha":"c504356b847e183f571a09ce5f808d4a7f229255","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI'm adding `spark.sql.files.allowReordering`, defaulting to `true`. When set to `true` the behavior is as before. When set to `false`, the input files are read in alphabetical order. This means partitions are read in the `part-00001`, `part-00002`, `part-00003`... order, recovering the same ordering as before.\r\n\r\nWhile [**SPARK-20144**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20144) has been closed as \"Not A Problem\", I think this is still a valuable feature. Spark has been [touted](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/11/14/setting-new-world-record-apache-spark.html) as the best tool for sorting. It certainly can sort data. But without this change, it can not read back sorted data on the DataFrame API.\r\n\r\nMy practical use case is that we allow users to run their SQL expressions through our UI. We also allow them to ask for the results to be persisted to Parquet files. We noticed that if they do an `ORDER BY`, the ordering is lost if they also ask for persistence. For example they might want to rank data points by a score, so they can later get the top 10 or top 10,000,000 entries easily. With this change we could fulfill this use case.\r\n\r\nThanks for hearing me out! :blush: \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function - *schema_of_csv()* which infers schema of CSV string literal. The result of the function is a string containing a schema in DDL format. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect schema_of_csv('1|abc', map('delimiter', '|'))\r\n``` \r\n```\r\nstruct<_c0:int,_c1:string>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests to `CsvFunctionsSuite`, `CsvExpressionsSuite` and SQL tests to `csv-functions.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-07T20:05:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T20:18:38Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T01:18:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ad4a7636ab6a98338498e0eba8de268e5b23453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3aa79d4e438a84ea7566f38afd3f2a18fd7cfbed","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:schema_of_csv-function","ref":"schema_of_csv-function","sha":"3aa79d4e438a84ea7566f38afd3f2a18fd7cfbed","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the first row of dataset of CSV strings is compared to field names of user specified or inferred schema independently of presence of CSV header. It causes false-positive error messages. For example, parsing `\"1,2\"` outputs the error:\r\n\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: CSV header does not conform to the schema.\r\n Header: 1, 2\r\n Schema: _c0, _c1\r\nExpected: _c0 but found: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose:\r\n- Checking CSV header only when it exists\r\n- Filter header from the input dataset only if it exists\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to `CSVSuite` which reproduces the issue.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-06T13:09:02Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:24Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T06:39:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a86722d82abd72e082c2f09db52e0822e9a45a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/676e5580e5f01c7800c734634911b65a91531d4b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:inferred-header-check","ref":"inferred-header-check","sha":"676e5580e5f01c7800c734634911b65a91531d4b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

it.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-06T10:15:48Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:27Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T19:08:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"897c38f3a341cd89bdc7b601ea9c181e93d72ca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20856b4132cbc6aa34484144112f3463e47c4906","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:csv-slash-delim","ref":"csv-slash-delim","sha":"20856b4132cbc6aa34484144112f3463e47c4906","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently SQL tab in the WEBUI doesn't support pagination. Because of that following issues are happening.\r\n1) For large number of executions, SQL page is throwing OOM exception (around 40,000)\r\n2) For large number of executions, loading SQL page is taking time.\r\n3) Difficult to analyse the execution table for large number of execution.\r\n[Note: spark.sql.ui.retainedExecutions = 50000]\r\n\r\nAll the tabs, Jobs, Stages etc. supports pagination. So, to make it consistent with other tabs\r\nSQL tab also should support pagination.\r\n\r\nI have followed the similar flow of the pagination code in the Jobs and Stages page for SQL page.\r\nAlso, this patch doesn't make any behavior change for the SQL tab except the pagination support.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nbin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.ui.retainedExecutions=50000\r\nRun 50,000 sql queries.\r\n**Before this PR**\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-05

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere was 5 suites extends `HadoopFsRelationTest`,  for testing \"orc\"/\"parquet\"/\"text\"/\"json\" data sources. \r\nThis PR refactor the base trait `HadoopFsRelationTest`:\r\n1. Rename unnecessary loop for setting parquet conf\r\n2. The test case `SPARK-8406: Avoids name collision while writing files` takes about 14 to 20 seconds. As now all the file format data source are using common code, for creating result files, we can test one data source(Parquet) only to reduce test time.\r\n\r\nTo run related 5 suites:\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt \"hive/testOnly *HadoopFsRelationSuite\"\r\n```\r\nThe total test run time is reduced from 5 minutes 40 seconds to 3 minutes 50 seconds.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this test case, we are verifying that the result of an UDF  is cached when the underlying data frame is cached and that the udf is not evaluated again when the cached data frame is used.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the runtime we do : \r\n1) Use a single partition dataframe, so the total execution time of UDF is more deterministic.\r\n2) Cut down the size of the dataframe from 10 to 2.\r\n3) Reduce the sleep time in the UDF from 5secs to 2secs.\r\n4) Reduce the failafter condition from 3 to 2.\r\n\r\nWith the above change, it takes about 4 secs to cache the first dataframe. And subsequent check takes a few hundred milliseconds.\r\nThe new runtime for 5 consecutive runs of this test is as follows : \r\n```\r\n[info] - cache UDF result correctly (4 seconds, 906 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - cache UDF result correctly (4 seconds, 281 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - cache UDF result correctly (4 seconds, 288 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - cache UDF result correctly (4 seconds, 355 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - cache UDF result correctly (4 seconds, 280 milliseconds)\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is s test fix.","created_at":"2018-10-05T08:04:13Z","updated_at":"2018-10-06T04:32:23Z","closed_at":"2018-10-06T00:30:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be905011bec21ab77774c5bd5b40635fa16ba4a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97d18feeb8713da42b9f97d2343063bac1cba4b6","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-25610","ref":"SPARK-25610","sha":"97d18feeb8713da42b9f97d2343063bac1cba4b6","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

working on another PR, I noticed that there is quite some legacy Java in there that can be beautified. For example the use of features from Java8, such as:\r\n- Collection libraries\r\n- Try-with-resource blocks\r\n\r\nNo logic has been changed. I think it is important to have a solid codebase with examples that will inspire next PR's to follow up on the best practices.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nThis makes code easier to read, and using try-with-resource makes is less likely to forget to close something.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNo changes in the logic of Spark, but more in the aesthetics of the code.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsing the existing unit tests. Since no logic is changed, the existing unit tests should pass.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-05T04:59:56Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T19:20:46Z","closed_at":"2018-10-08T15:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1d2a851dbe2cca1507e6ad22c4825f7be1ad016","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c9f065ceb2c8458a67b2a0fb24664a36ef67484","head":{"label":"Fokko:SPARK-25408","ref":"SPARK-25408","sha":"9c9f065ceb2c8458a67b2a0fb24664a36ef67484","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49888791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTg4ODc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Fokko/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is inspired by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22524, but proposes a safer fix.\r\n\r\nThe current limit whole stage codegen has 2 problems:\r\n1. It's only applied to `InputAdapter`, many leaf nodes can't stop earlier w.r.t. limit.\r\n2. It needs to override a method, which will break if we have more than one limit in the whole-stage.\r\n\r\nThe first problem is easy to fix, just figure out which nodes can stop earlier w.r.t. limit, and update them. This PR updates `RangeExec`, `ColumnarBatchScan`, `SortExec`, `HashAggregateExec`.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is hard to fix. This PR proposes to propagate the limit counter variable name upstream, so that the upstream leaf/blocking nodes can check the limit counter and quit the loop earlier.\r\n\r\nFor better performance, the implementation here follows `CodegenSupport.needStopCheck`, so that we only codegen the check only if there is limit in the query. For columnar node like range, we check the limit counter per-batch instead of per-row, to make the inner loop tight and fast.\r\n\r\nWhy this is safer?\r\n1. the leaf/blocking nodes don't have to check the limit counter and stop earlier. It's only for performance. (this is same as before)\r\n2. The blocking operators can stop propagating the limit counter name, because the counter of limit after blocking operators will never increase, before blocking operators consume all the data from upstream operators. So the upstream operators don't care about limit after blocking operators. This is also for performance only, it's OK if we forget to do it for some new blocking operators.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the test introduced for SPARK-22226, so that we don't run analysis and optimization on the plan. The scope of the test is code generation and running the above mentioned operation is expensive and useless for the test.\r\n\r\nThe UT was also moved to the `CodeGenerationSuite` which is a better place given the scope of the test.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nrunning the UT before SPARK-22226 fails, after it passes. The execution time is about 50% the original one. On my laptop this means that the test now runs in about 23 seconds (instead of 50 seconds).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-04T14:52:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T01:57:01Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T01:57:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"700bf0d63347d0be6ea1d44fbdb67323733d3f53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2cdb7e446dcd709ef96bca60ab5df46c6a00a69a","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-25609","ref":"SPARK-25609","sha":"2cdb7e446dcd709ef96bca60ab5df46c6a00a69a","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe want to change the default percentage to 100 for spark.shuffle.server.chunkFetchHandlerThreadsPercent. The reason being\r\ncurrently this is set to 0. Which means currently if server.ioThreads > 0, the default number of threads would be 2 * #cores instead of server.io.Threads. We want the default to server.io.Threads in case this is not set at all. Also here a default of 0 would also mean 2 * #cores\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review
