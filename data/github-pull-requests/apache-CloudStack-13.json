Description\r\n\r\nAfter the changes in #4774, when an account other than the root admin lists templates/ISOs with pagination, count gets set to the number of items returned in that page. For example, when the user lists 10 templates/ISOs and 15 entries are found, in the first page, count is set to 10 (the number of items being returned), as opposed to 15 (the total number of items). As a result, the deploy VM wizard only shows the first page of templates/ISOs.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this behavior and makes count return the correct number of found entries.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nEverything has been tested in a local lab.\r\n\r\nIn the tested scenario, the following domains have templates:\r\n- `ROOT`: 13 public and featured templates;\r\n- `ROOT/test`: 4 public and featured templates.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nCloudMonkey command used to list templates.\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist templates templatefilter=featured page=1 pageSize=5\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIn every test, the expected number of templates/ISOs was returned.\r\n\r\nWith `share.public.templates.with.other.domains` set to `true` in both domains:\r\n- In the root admin account, I listed the templates.

Description\r\n\r\nThe concept of public roles was introduced in the PR [#6960](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6960), however this resource was not extended to the UI. Thus, a field was added in the role creation, update and import form that allows you to choose whether the role is public or not.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created, imported and updated some roles, then I checked the result of these operations in the database.\r\n\r\n| N° | Test | isPublic | Expected result |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows admin to set a \"cloud-name\" for cloud-init metadata. Configdrive has no special handling to determine what cloud it is being run on, it just generically sets the cloud-name to the datasource name. By providing this metadata key, we can allow admin to configure this for users.\r\n\r\nFollowed the same pattern for adding \"cloud-domain\" and other metadata.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or

Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested locally by first keeping the value unset and confirming there is no change to the data\r\n\r\n```\r\n# cloud-init query cloud-name\r\nconfigdrive\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen set the config key `metadata.custom.cloud.name` and confirmed it was reflected in the VM\r\n\r\n```\r\n# cloud-init query cloud-name\r\nmarcuscloud\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tested it works with VR as userdata provider:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl

Description\r\nPushing this to get some feedback, trying to provide a feature and reusing some functionality like the existing VM power state reporting, rather than inventing whole new messaging.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows KVM to detect guests that stop or crash, and immediately trigger a power state report to update the VM state in CloudStack.\r\n\r\nIn current design, Agent is responsible for sending pings on interval. These pings contain a state report for each VM. If something changes in between these pings, it can potentially take a long time for discovery of VM state change.\r\n\r\nWhen Agent first starts, it loads the `ServerResource` (implementation is `LibvirtComputingResource` in the shipping agent) and initializes it. Then later it calls the ServerResource `getCurrentStatus()` to collect the host and VM status to send `PingCommand` on intervals. This change adds two interfaces - if the `ServerResource` implements `ResourceStatusUpdater`, then the agent registers itself as an `AgentStatusUpdater`, which gives the `ServerResource` a way to trigger an update, by calling `AgentStatusUpdater.triggerUpdate()`. This keeps the implementation of monitoring and collecting the VM status in the ServerResource, while allowing the `Agent` to still handle sending the update, and not requiring all existing implementations of `ServerResource` and `IAgentControl` to implement these by changing the existing interfaces. There may be a cleaner way to do this.\r\n\r\nIn LibvirtComputingResource, we register an event listener, and process domain lifecycle events, looking only for `STOPPED` events that are due to a crash or a shutdown. Domain stop due to things like `virsh destroy`\" or cloudstack issuing a stop will have a detail of `DESTROYED` or `MIGRATED` in the case of migration, rather than `CRASHED` or `SHUTDOWN`. I considered briefly adding some code to track if we were in the middle of a StopCommand or similar to filter out superfluous events, this seems simpler, at the expense of not being able to update on admin `virsh destroy`.\r\n\r\nThe PingCommand has been given a boolean to indicate if the Ping is out of band. This is important, because the code that processes pings on the management server will ignore pings that come more often than the expected interval (presumably to avoid state thrashing?). This boolean gives us the ability to force processing of pings if they are out of band. Therefore it's also important that we are only triggering these on valid state change events, and not issuing superfluous updates any time a VM stops due to cloudstack issuing stop, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested locally by shutting down VM within guest, vs `virsh destroy` or stopping via CloudStack API. Tested to ensure listener still works after libvirt restart.\r\n\r\nThere are no existing tests for VirtualMachienPowerStateSyncImpl, and the change here is very minor (reacting to the

PR aims at improving the CloudStack dashboard and introduces the following:\r\n\r\n- Admin dashboard: six cards that are responsive to screen sizes and show zone specific compute, storage and network allocation, as well as instance/hosts stats, alerts and events. Now, by default, the admin dashboard shows aggegate data from all zones, with option for admin to select individual zone to see individual zone stats\r\n- Account/project dashboard: six cards that are responsive to screen sizes and show account or project specific resource lists/counts, and limits shown in three cards as (a) compute (with running stopped instances), (b) storage and (c) network allocation, an admin-defined links/docs card (via config.json) and events cards. Admin is allowed to configure project limits on project dashboards.\r\n- A global create button on the top global header/user-menu to allow for quick actions such as to deploy a VM, CKS cluster and create a volume (more actions can be added as desired via code changes) etc.\r\n\r\nDoc PR - https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/349\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\nQuick create

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR increases the overhead calculated for ScaleIO encrypted volumes slightly from 32MB to 128MB, due to edge cases found with lots of small writes over many weeks causing excessive fragmentation.  Ideally discard/fstrim is being issued in the guest to free some meaningful amount of space occasionally, but this should help for situations where that isn't guaranteed.\r\n\r\n### Types of

Description\r\n\r\nWhile creating a VM using VMware, if the template does not have a nic adapter configured, CloudStack will default to `E1000`. There is a global configuration called `VmwareSystemVmNicDeviceType` that allows the operator to choose the default nic adapter for system VMs, however, no such configuration exists for user VMs.\r\n\r\nA new global configuration was created to allow the operator to choose the default nic adapter for user VMs.\r\n\r\n<!---

PR - https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/352\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows listing files in a primary storage (for KVM, VMWare & XenServer hypervisors) and secondary storage (via SSVM). We also link the templates, snapshots and volumes with the files in the UI.\r\nThis will also help to list files which are not in cloudstack db but left over due to some failed action.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n#### Implementation Overview\r\nWe send a command to endpoint for a datastore (SSVM for secondary storage and Hypervisor manager or hosts) to list files at a path. Using the answer, we link tempate id, snapshot id and volume id by querying the database and send the response.\r\n\r\n#### Commands Added\r\n* **Command** - `listImageStoreObjects`\r\n* params\r\n  * `id` - id of the image store\r\n  * `path` - path to list on image store\r\n* **Command** - `listStoragePoolObjects`\r\n* **params**\r\n  * `id` - id of the storage pool\r\n  * `path` - path to list on storage pool\r\n* **Command** - `migrateResourceToAnotherSecondaryStorage`\r\n* params\r\n  * `srcpool` - id of the image store from where the data is to be migrated\r\n  * `destpool` - id of the destination secondary storage pool to which the resources are to be migrated\r\n  * `templates` - id(s) of the templates to be migrated\r\n  * `snapshots` - id(s) of the snapshots to be migrated\r\n\r\n#### Response for `listImageStoreObjects` and `listStoragePoolObjects`\r\nList response containing the following keys:\r\n* `name` - Name of the data store object\r\n* `isdirectory` - Is it a directory\r\n* `size` - Size is in Bytes\r\n* `templateid` - Template ID associated with the data store object\r\n* `format` - Format of template associated with the data store object\r\n* `snapshotid` - Snapshot ID associated with the data store object\r\n* `volumeid` - Volume ID associated with the data store object\r\n* `lastupdated` - Last modified date of the file/directory\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When

Description\r\nCloudStack allows you to change host tags and storage tags of system offerings through the API, but it was missing from the UI. This just added the fields so the UI window is the same as the compute offering's window.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/22242548/219ad68e-353b-4b81-91da-58793d48974c)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI created a system offering without host or storage tags, added them through the edit window and verified they were added.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the PowerFlex plugin to gracefully handle the case where volume has already been removed from the backend PowerFlex storage and a user attempts to expunge volume.  \r\n\r\nWithout this, attempting to also clean up in cloudstack results in volumes that are stuck in `Destroy` state, unless an admin manually edits the database.  If the volume is missing on the back end and admins want to recover, they can still attempt to fix this in some way and the record would be preserved in CloudStack as long as a volume expunge is not attempted.\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to expunge the volume Vol[37950|name=testvol|vm=null|DATADISK] in Primary data store : Unable to delete PowerFlex volume: xxxxx:xxxxx due to API failed due to: {\"message\":\"Could not find the volume\",\"httpStatusCode\":500,\"errorCode\":79}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe catch this error case and match the error message to determine if the volume is already gone. There may be some document for handling the error codes more directly, but currently the PowerFlex client doesn't handle errors in this way.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change

Description\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/7181\r\n\r\nAdded a new getter 'allProjects' and mutation 'RELOAD_ALL_PROJECTS' to centralize the tracking of available projects in the state. \r\n\r\nThis eliminates direct manipulation of the Project list in separate components and improves data consistency across the application. \r\n\r\nA watcher in ProjectMenu.vue has been implemented to handle changes to the 'allProjects' getter. \r\n\r\nThe 'RELOAD_ALL_PROJECTS' mutation was also added where necessary to ensure the projects list is updated in the state whenever changes occur.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nBefore fix:

Description\r\n\r\nCurrent properties on `db.properties` are limited and focused only on mysql. This PR adds a new property on `db.properties`, `db.cloud.uri`, that when set, will be used for the connection with the DBMS. This enables URI configuration and use with other DBMSs, such as mariaDB.\r\n\r\nWhen using the `db.cloud.uri` property, the following properties will be **ignored**:\r\n- `db.cloud.host`;\r\n- `db.cloud.port`;\r\n- `db.cloud.name`;\r\n- `db.cloud.autoReconnect`;\r\n- `db.cloud.url.params`;\r\n- `db.cloud.replicas`;\r\n- `db.cloud.autoReconnect`;\r\n- `db.cloud.failOverReadOnly`;\r\n- `db.cloud.reconnectAtTxEnd`;\r\n- `db.cloud.autoReconnectForPools`;\r\n- `db.cloud.secondsBeforeRetrySource`;\r\n- `db.cloud.queriesBeforeRetrySource`;\r\n- `db.cloud.initialTimeout`;\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using the `db.usage.uri` property, the following properties will be **ignored**:\r\n- `db.usage.host`;\r\n- `db.usage.port`;\r\n- `db.usage.name`;\r\n- `db.usage.autoReconnect`;\r\n- `db.usage.url.params`;\r\n- `db.usage.replicas`;\r\n- `db.usage.autoReconnect`;\r\n- `db.usage.failOverReadOnly`;\r\n- `db.usage.reconnectAtTxEnd`;\r\n- `db.usage.autoReconnectForPools`;\r\n- `db.usage.secondsBeforeRetrySource`;\r\n- `db.usage.queriesBeforeRetrySource`;\r\n- `db.usage.initialTimeout`;\r\n\r\nWhen using both, the following properties will also be **ignored**:\r\n- `db.ha.enable`;\r\n- `db.ha.loadBalanceStrategy`;\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds support for the MariaDB driver.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nUsing the current version in a setup with mariaDB and Galera, with a cluster size of 3 and the following configuration on the `db.properties` file:\r\n```\r\n# High Availability And Cluster Properties\r\ndb.ha.enabled=true\r\ndb.ha.loadBalanceStrategy=com.cloud.utils.db.StaticStrategy\r\n# cloud stack Database\r\ndb.cloud.replicas=192.168.201.161,192.168.201.162\r\ndb.cloud.autoReconnect=false\r\ndb.cloud.failOverReadOnly=false\r\ndb.cloud.reconnectAtTxEnd=false\r\ndb.cloud.autoReconnectForPools=true\r\ndb.cloud.secondsBeforeRetrySource=1800\r\ndb.cloud.queriesBeforeRetrySource=5000\r\ndb.cloud.initialTimeout=3600\r\n```\r\nWhen the mysql service stops in the main node, ACS is able to switch to one of the other two. But if the host is shut down, this switch never occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the changes proposed in this PR, by configuring the `db.cloud.uri`:\r\n```\r\ndb.cloud.uri=jdbc:mariadb:sequential://192.168.201.160:3306,192.168.201.161:3306,192.168.201.162:3306/cloud?autoReconnect=true&prepStmtCacheSize=517&cachePrepStmts=true&sessionVariables=sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'&serverTimezone=UTC\r\n```\r\nI was able to configure and use the `sequential` fail over mode. This way, when the mysql service stops in the main node and even if the host is shut down, ACS was able to switch to the other DBs.","created_at":"2023-08-22T16:56:57Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T03:27:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-10T16:27:35Z","merged_at":"2023-11-10T16:27:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"30ca5d1a196f45e43fc585e251591685421a6e23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":916085075,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTYwODUwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:database","name":"component:database","color":"2CFACC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1152978013,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUyOTc4MDEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:build","name":"component:build","color":"6e1ec9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/24","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/24","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/24/labels","id":7742093,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AdiKN","number":24,"title":"4.19.0.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":317,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-03-07T09:30:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:27Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-02T12:49:11Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7895/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/7895/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/7895/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/8fa0f4e6b08c3a409455a653fdcf790029c37cad","head":{"label":"scclouds:flexible-db-uri","ref":"flexible-db-uri","sha":"8fa0f4e6b08c3a409455a653fdcf790029c37cad","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1

Multipath SCSI for KVM, Pure Flash Array and HPE-Primera Support\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR provides a new primary storage volume type called \"FiberChannel\" that allows access to volumes connected to hosts over fiber channel connections.  It requires Multipath to provide path discovery and failover.  Second, the PR adds an AdaptivePrimaryDatastoreProvider that abstracts how volumes are managed/orchestrated from the connector to communicate with the primary storage provider, using a ProviderAdapter interface, allowing the code interacting with the primary storage provider API's to be simpler and have no direct dependencies on Cloudstack code.  Lastly, the PR provides an implementation of the ProviderAdapter classes for the HP Enterprise Primera line of storage solutions and the Pure Flash Array line of storage solutions.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTesting involves the following setup:\r\n1.

run locally then there is faster feedback to the developer before opening a pr.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the capability in CloudStack to convert VMware Instances disk(s) to KVM using virt-v2v and import them as CloudStack instances. It enables CloudStack operators to import VMware instances from vSphere into a KVM cluster managed by CloudStack. vSphere/VMware setup might be managed by CloudStack or be a standalone setup.\r\n\r\n- CloudStack will let the administrator select a VM from an existing VMware vCenter in the CloudStack environment or external vCenter requesting vCenter IP, Datacenter name and credentials.\r\n- The migrated VM will be imported as a KVM instance\r\n- The migration is done through virt-v2v: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473, https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/virt/virt-v2v-integration.html\r\n- The migration process timeout can be set by the setting `convert.instance.process.timeout`\r\n- Before attempting the virt-v2v migration, CloudStack will create a clone of the source VM on VMware. The clone VM will be removed after the registration process finishes.\r\n- CloudStack will delegate the migration action to a KVM host and the host will attempt to migrate the VM invoking virt-v2v. In case the guest OS is not supported then CloudStack will handle the error operation as a failure\r\n- The migration process using virt-v2v may not be a fast process\r\n- CloudStack will not perform any check about the guest OS compatibility for the virt-v2v library as indicated on: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the case where someone updates the VM details via API and the non-displayable details that cloudstack uses for managing config internally get deleted.  An example of a non-displayable detail is `configDriveLocation`. If a user is using host based config drive, then configDriveLocation = \"HOST\".  If any detail is updated/changed, then this non-displayable detail is wiped. It was never visible via the API, so there's no chance someone could preserve it during a detail update.\r\n\r\nIn the case that the VM is stopped, a detail is updated, and then the VM delete is attempted, VM deletion can fail because it can't find the proper config drive location. A workaround for this specific situation is to start the VM, which will rewrite the missing detail. However, this surfaced the issue that these hidden details aren't preserved if details are updated.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested as user and as admin manually.\r\n\r\nProvided a Marvin test for updateVirtualMachine to cover common situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-19T21:13:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T08:45:39Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T08:45:39Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T08:45:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0702279aae011316a5a5af7e206ad0309f06b41","assignee":{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR publishes an action event for VM.STOP when the power state processor detects a VM is gone from hypervisor. Currently only a power state event is published on the message bus. This allows events to be seen and processed when VM is detected to be stopped out of band.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it was discovered that the existing missing VM code is triggered when a VM is taking awhile to start. For example if we are waiting on the router VM to come up, the report can possibly see no VM when one is expected. The VM is assigned to the host, but doesn't exist yet, and triggers the missing VM code.  A check was added to ignore the VM if it is still in \"Starting\" state.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ]

band stop by shutting down guest within the VM, confirmed new event triggered.\r\n\r\nTested startup of VM where power state is processed while waiting on router to come up, confirmed events no longer triggered detecting a \"missing VM\" when VM is in starting state.\r\n\r\nTested live migration, confirmed we processed power state reports for both source and destination hypervisor hosts and did not issue the new VM.STOP event.\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #7433 \r\n\r\nIt was a bit strange that cloudstack only tries to deploy VRs with at most two hypervisors. If there are more than 2 hypervisors (e.g. kvm/vmware/xen) on the environment, the VR deployment might fail.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\nThis PR adds new functionality to copy snapshots across zones and take snapshots for multiple zones.\r\n\r\nCopy functionality is similar to template copy. The source zone acts as the web server from where the destination zone(s) can download the snapshot files. For this purpose, a new API - `copySnapshot` has been added. The response for copySnapshot will be returning zone and download details from the first destination zone of the request. This behaviour is similar to the `copyTemplate` API.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, multiple zones can be selected while taking the snapshots or creating snapshot policies. For this snapshot will be taken in the base zone(in which volume is present) and then copied to the additional zones. A new parameter - `zoneids` has been added to `createSnapshot` and `createSnapshotPolicy` APIs.\r\n\r\nAs snapshots can be present on multiple zones (secondary stores), a new parameter `zoneid` has been added to delete the snapshot copy on a specific zone.\r\n\r\n`listSnapshots` API has been updated to allow listing snapshot entries for different zones/datastores. New parameters - `showUnique`, `locationType` have been added.\r\n\r\nEvents generated during snapshot operations will now be linked to the snapshot itself rather than the volume of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n`listSnapshotPolicies` and `createSnapshotPolicy` APIs will return zone details of the zones in which backup will be scheduled for the policy.\r\n\r\n----\r\nNew API added\r\n`copySnapshot`\r\n\r\nRequest and response params updated for APIs\r\n```\r\n- listSnapshots\r\n- deleteSnapshot\r\n- createTemplate\r\n- listZones\r\n- listSnapshotPolicies\r\n- createSnapshotPolicy\r\n```\r\nUI updated for\r\n- Snapshot detail view\r\n- Create snapshot form\r\n- Create snapshot policy form\r\n- Create volume (from snapshot) form\r\n- Create template (from snapshot) form\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/344\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-05 17-28-26](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/d6ed39d8-b604-481a-85af-bba3ca6d7971)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-05 17-27-52](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/58134c8e-a7aa-4e7d-9a0f-ae222d9a9382)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-05 17-28-13](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/a64d7ec8-5ad1-4a89-a712-2bc6d2967096)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-05 17-27-06](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/e5abca80-d8a0-4a4e-8c6b-ea77b401adc3)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-05 17-27-20](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/5e93d3ac-fd7f-4c73-ac68-822d7827bb16)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-27 16-06-54](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/153340/1253b986-e0e3-40a9-b1ee-d50aa41879d1)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n\r\nManual snapshot operations in a multi-zone environment\r\n\r\nSmoke test added:\r\n```\r\n[root@ref-trl-5659-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-marvin marvin]# nosetests --with-xunit --xunit-file=results.xml --with-marvin --marvin-config=./ref-trl-5659-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-advanced-cfg -s -a tags=advanced --hypervisor=KVM tests/component/test_snapshot_copy.py\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py:32: CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team.

Description\r\n\r\nThe `listHostsMetrics` API returns the number of user VMs on the host. Although it doesn't return any data from the system VM instances on it.\r\n\r\nDue to this, the `systeminstances` field was created in the `listHostsMetrics` API, which returns how many system VMs are running on the host and how many system VMs the host has in total.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nAdmins should be able to disable the 2FA of users that lost their second factor; however, the `setupUserTwoFactorAuthentication` API only allows them to disable the 2FA of users in the same domain. This means that, if the root admin wants to disable the 2FA of a user in ROOT/test, he must create a domain admin account in ROOT/test and log into that account to do this.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by allowing admins to disable the 2FA of users in their subdomains.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ]

This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI did the following tests in a local lab:\r\n\r\n| Number | Test | Previous result | New result | New result was expected (Y/N)? |\r\n| - | - | - | - | - |\r\n| 1 | Disable

Description\r\n\r\nIn the deploy VM wizard, the settings inherited from a template (`iothreads`, `iothreads`, `io.policy`, `keyboard`, `UEFI` and dynamically scalable) are not automatically inferred after selecting the template. This would not matter for most of these settings if the user did not change the fields, since they would still be inherited when the parameters were null; however, the boot type and mode would always default to BIOS and LEGACY, even when set to something else in the template.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to address this issue by making the deploy VM wizard automatically infer the settings inherited from a template.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn the deploy VM wizard:\r\n1. I selected a template with dynamic scaling enabled and the settings `keyboard=jp`, `io.policy=io_uring`, `UEFI=LEGACY` and `iothreads=enabled`. Then, I verified that the fields were automatically inferred and, after deploying, that the expected parameters were present in the API call.\r\n2. I selected the same template as in item 1, changed the value in the fields and verified that the parameters also changed in the API call.\r\n3. I selected a template that had dynamic scaling disabled and no settings. Then, I verified that the fields were not automatically inferred (except dynamic scaling) and, after deploying, that the corresponding parameters were not in the API call (with the exception of `dynamicscalingenabled=false`).\r\n4. I selected the template from item 1 and then selected the template from item 3. Finally, I verified that the fields in the UI and the parameters in the API call had the same values as in item 3.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-14T17:15:29Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T10:35:08Z","closed_at":"2023-08-25T14:36:36Z","merged_at":"2023-08-25T14:36:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"57d4d0d94a73da781b23ef332a0ad2056678db91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"harikrishna-patnala","id":3348673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala","html_url":"https://github.com/harikrishna-patnala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/27/labels","id":8830986,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AhsAK","number":27,"title":"4.18.1.0","description":"first

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the Super-Linter action which was running `flake8` and moves this check to pre-commit.\r\n\r\nWe are running an older version of the GitHub Super-Linter which should be updated.\r\n\r\nSo we can now run flake8 locally with pre-commit to speed up review time.  Finding issues on our local machine first instead of waiting for the Super-Linter action to finish when opening a pr.\r\n\r\nAlso the GitHub Actions policy of the ASF says: \r\n\r\n\"You MAY use all actions internal to the apache/*, github/* and actions/* namespaces without restrictions.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\nSince the most current version of the Super-Linter is no longer under \"github/*\" we need to remove this action.\r\n\r\n\"NOTICE: If your use of the super-linter action failed around April 26th, 2023, we changed the organization name from github to super-linter so you will need to update your references to this action from github/super-linter to super-linter/super-linter.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/super-linter/super-linter\r\n\r\nhttps://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/using-hooks.html\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/flake8\r\n\r\nWhen run locally with pre-commit the flake8 check found some Python files which had issues which I have ignored and these can be cleaned up or processed later if needed.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in

Description\r\n\r\nACS allows you to add NICs to a VM without them, although it is not possible to set them as default since the `updateDefaultNicForVirtualMachine` API only updates the default NIC if a default NIC already exists, otherwise an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, when a NIC is added and the VM that the NIC is being created for has no default NIC, the NIC will be marked as default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aligns the use of terminology, renaming VM / virtual machine references to 'Instance' and also capitalising the terms Templates, Network, Snapshot, User, Account in CloudStack APIs, error and log messages, events, tooltips, etc. Many typos, grammar and spelling mistakes were fixed, also terms like IPv4, VPN, VPC, etc. were properly capitalised. Some error messages were cleaned for better readability. The test cases, expecting some exception strings were adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n###

Description\r\n\r\nWhile checking an account access to prevent the role escalation, the `checkAccess` method is using both `DynamicRoleBasedAPIAccessChecker` and `StaticRoleBasedAPIAccessChecker` (legacy) classes and that is causing some inconsistences in the validations, consequently allowing the role escalation.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the `StaticRoleBasedAPIAccessChecker` was disabled if `DynamicRoleBasedAPIAccessChecker` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code

created a domain admin custom role (DA2) and allowed all API's to it using the `*` regex;\r\n- Removed an API that it had in common with default domain admin role;\r\n- Tried to create a default domain admin account using a DA2 account;\r\n- Received an exception from the role eslacation prevention.","created_at":"2023-08-10T19:33:34Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T07:33:08Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T07:33:05Z","merged_at":"2023-08-18T07:33:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b339673109400ff949b91c1c74c709b72f91178","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":928084492,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MjgwODQ0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Critical","name":"Severity:Critical","color":"900606","default":false,"description":"Critical

Description\r\n\r\nTwo new settings at domain level were added to allow definition of header and footer of Quota emails:\r\n- `quota.email.header`: defines the header of all Quota emails.\r\n- `quota.email.footer`: defines the footer of all Quota emails.\r\n\r\nThe settings are added directly to the body of the text, so if you want a line break between the header/footer and the body of the text, you need to make it explicit (e.g. `<br/>`). By default the header/footer are not defined.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code

introduces change in AutogenView to do the following:\r\n\r\n- Cancel old list API requests when the route is changed (between different list view or list and resource views)\r\n- In the handler of an API call made in the fetchData(), to check if the json received is for the current route/id (API)\r\n- Add console log for debugging which may be removed if this passes code review and testing\r\n\r\nFixes #7840\r\n\r\nHow was this tested?\r\n- In my env the listVirtualMachines API takes time to complete, so I go to the instances page and go quick back/forth other views; for example, go to instances page that doesn't load and click on 2nd VM (or go to instance page and search something that returns faster than the whole list API and go the VM). When the original list API call completes, the current VM is replaced by the first VM in the list.\r\n- Check console log with the fix and network to see that old API (xhr) requests that haven't completed are cancelled when the route/view is changed between list and resource views of different resources\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause

Description\r\n\r\nThis change replaces Hashtable with LinkedHashMap in the `createIsoResponse` method of `ViewResponseHelper`.\r\nThis modification is to maintain the insertion order of entries, which isn't the case with Hashtable.\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem described here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/7278\r\n\r\nRelated to the ordering of the ISOs table in CloudStack.\r\nCurrently, the order is not maintained because, when using a Hashtable, the insertion order gets lost when it tries to create the list on the API side.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test
