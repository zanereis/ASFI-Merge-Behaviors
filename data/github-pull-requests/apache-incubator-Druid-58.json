Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #10649.\r\nThere are two minor shortcomings in Druid historical loading, which can be enhancement to improve the robustness.\r\n\r\n**Fitst** :\r\nWhen Historical start up or do compact action, Druid will check segments are loaded or not.\r\nThe existing logic is based on whether the directory exists. When directory exists but segment files are damaged during download and unzip from DeepStorage, like crashed, this simple check will pass. What's worse is that any action using this segments like segment loading or datasource compaction will fail unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n**Second** :\r\nWhen set `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.type=http`  using \"http\"  implementation to assign segment loads/drops to historical, there is a LRU cache design to maintain idempotent if same request shows up again and to return status of a completed request https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/b91a16943b03abbaea6215e9517f8bf62a442c71/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordination/SegmentLoadDropHandler.java#L95\r\n\r\nAnd only new requests can be executed\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/b91a16943b03abbaea6215e9517f8bf62a442c71/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordination/SegmentLoadDropHandler.java#L510\r\n\r\nIf last action loads damaged segment files mentioned above , this action is failed and cached.\r\n\r\nNext time coordinator asks historical to load this segment again, Historical Server will response failure based on cache rather than try to load again which will success.\r\n\r\nThis cycle may cause coordinator letting current historical node loading this segments over and over again. And Historical will keep response failure without a retry until LRU cache is Invalidation or Stream Index Task is failed because of completionTimeout limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n1. Do segment files integrity check before loading based on `downloadStartMarker`\r\n2. Try to load segments again after failure.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

What\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10643 by handling the case where the returned value of a query was null but was being formatted as a timestamp leading to a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nI've added a check to see if the value for a field we're returning is null. I've considered the behaviour of this change in two cases:\r\n\r\n1) `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=true`: We never receive a null value in this case but we can get the initial value of any aggregation buffer involved with the time column, i've opened https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10644 for this, im not sure if this is a bug or what the actual behaviour should be. In this PR the value returned from aggregation will get formatted as a timestamp\r\n\r\n2) `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`: In this case the value will be null and we pass it along to the output instead of attempting to format it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nAs the linked issue states, this image for local hadoop is based on a CentOS 6.6 image. The age of that base image seems to introduce some issues. First, the yum repositories are now in the centos vault and you can't use the old mirrorlist for them. To fix this, I am dropping in an edited CentOS-Base.repo during the image build. Second, curl seems to be having issues with ssl. I did not spend too much time looking into it because I figured the version is super old and using some stale protocol or something. Flipping to wget fixed it with no more interference, so I just went with it. After these two changes, I am now getting a successful image build and am able to run hadoop integration tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested ~~in a test Druid cluster.~~\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR implements requirements described in #10584\r\n\r\nIn this PR, 3 SQL functions and 3 corresponding native functions are provided to format numbers to different style.\r\n\r\n| SQL/Native function | Description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| human_readable_binary_byte_format(value[, precision]) | Returns the value in human-readable [IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) format. Supported unit suffix: `B`, `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, `TiB`, `PiB`, `EiB`. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). |\r\n| human_readable_decimal_byte_format(value[, precision]) | Returns the value in human-readable [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) format. Supported unit suffix: `B`, `KB`, `MB`, `GB`, `TB`, `PB`, `EB`. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). |\r\n| human_readable_decimal_format(value[, precision]) | Returns the value in human-readable SI format. Supported unit suffix:  `K`, `M`, `G`, `T`, `P`, `E`. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). |\r\n\r\nThe reason why 3 functions are provided to user instead of 1 function with different argument of format is that we think it's more simpler for a user to call these function. However in internal implementation, there's only one public format function exposed for all 3 format.\r\n\r\nWe've tested this feature in our clusters, and it works as we expect.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6525742/102842930-1aea6a80-4443-11eb-9314-42d97332f070.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb Console now looks like\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6525742/110092237-5656cd00-7dd4-11eb-8be9-850cee59c80b.png)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

bugs fixed:\r\n\r\n1) Indexers would not announce themselves as segment servers if they\r\n   did not have storage locations defined. This used to work, but was\r\n   broken in #9971. Fixed this by adding an \"isSegmentServer\" method\r\n   to ServerType and updating SegmentLoadDropHandler to always announce\r\n   if this method returns true.\r\n\r\n2) Certain batch task types were written in a way that assumed \"isReady\"\r\n   would be called before \"run\", which is not guaranteed. In particular,\r\n   they relied on it in order to initialize \"taskLockHelper\". Fixed this\r\n   by updating AbstractBatchIndexTask to ensure \"isReady\" is called\r\n   before \"run\" for these tasks.\r\n\r\n3) UnifiedIndexerAppenderatorsManager did not properly handle join\r\n    datasources. Introduced DataSourceAnalysis in order to fix this.\r\n\r\nTest changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add a new \"docker-compose.cli-indexer.yml\" config that spins up an\r\n   Indexer instead of a MiddleManager.\r\n\r\n2) Introduce a \"USE_INDEXER\" environment variable that determines if\r\n   docker-compose will start up an Indexer or a MiddleManager.\r\n\r\n3) Duplicate all the jdk8 tests and run them in both MiddleManager and\r\n   Indexer mode.\r\n\r\n4) Various adjustments to encourage fail-fast errors in the Docker\r\n   build scripts.\r\n\r\n5) Various adjustments to speed up integration tests and reduce memory\r\n   usage.\r\n\r\n6) Add another Mac-specific approach to determining a machine's own IP.\r\n   This was useful on my development machine.\r\n\r\n7) Update segment-count check in ITCompactionTaskTest to eliminate a\r\n   race condition (it was looking for 6 segments, which only exist\r\n   together briefly, until the older 4 are marked unused).\r\n\r\nJavadoc updates:\r\n\r\n1) AbstractBatchIndexTask: Added javadocs to determineLockGranularityXXX\r\n   that make it clear when taskLockHelper will be initialized as a side\r\n   effect. (Related to the second bug above.)\r\n\r\n2) Task: Clarified that \"isReady\" is not guaranteed to be called before\r\n   \"run\". It was already implied, but now it's explicit.\r\n\r\n3) ZkCoordinator: Clarified deprecation message.\r\n\r\n4) DataSegmentServerAnnouncer: Clarified deprecation

Description\r\n\r\nIntroduces a \"mapStringString\" complex type dimension column. All the code lives in an isolated contrib extension and implements relevant extensible Druid core interfaces e.g. ComplexColumn, ComplexMetricSerde, DimensionHandler, DimensionIndexer, DimensionMerger etc etc.\r\n\r\nIt allows ingestion of `Map<String,String>` column in users input data as a single `dimension` column . At query time, user can access individual keys in the map as if they were simple `string` dimension columns (see `MapStringStringKeyVirtualColumn.java` ) or column can be accessed as records of `Map<String,String>` type but that does not have much use in Druid query layer for now aside from `select` query.\r\n\r\nUser would have to implement their own `InputRowParser` to supply  `Map<String,String>` records for ingestion , we used one that was very specific to our needs.\r\n\r\nThis extension also serves as an example of how users can create their own dimension columns for the specific needs and also [indirectly] tests the dimension extensibility support introduced in #10277\r\n\r\nFuture: Now that `VirtualColumn` interface has been enhanced to support vectorization, maybe the virtual column implementation code in this extension could also be improved to support that for [potentially] better performance.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

option for maxBytesInMemory to be percentage of JVM memory\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n`maxBytesInMemory` can be hard to set when the user does not knows the actual value of max JVM heap memory set on the peon. Even if a user does know the value of max JVM heap memory, it can still be hard as most likely the value set will be very huge (since it is in byte). This can be confusing when there are many digits and zero (i.e. thinking how many MB or GB is 1395863657)\r\n\r\nWith this PR, setting `maxBytesInMemory` to any value between 0 and 100 will have the effect of setting number of bytes to aggregate in heap memory before persisting to the value of `maxBytesInMemory` percentage of max JVM heap memory. For example, if max JVM heap memory is 100MB and setting `maxBytesInMemory` to 25 then the actual number of bytes to aggregate in heap memory before persisting will be 25MB.\r\n\r\nThis is a change in existing behavior BUT only for any user that sets `maxBytesInMemory` between 0 byte to 100 bytes. I believe there is probably never a use case for this. So we should be good. Note that existing behavior of  `maxBytesInMemory` with values of -1 and 0 still remains the same.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

string byte calculation in StringDimensionIndexer\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDruid Ingestion has a guardrail of maxBytesInMemory. The default value of maxBytesInMemory is 1/6 of max java memory which should prevent the ingestion task (peon) from OOM. However, for this to work correctly, it relies on accurate calculation of bytes in memory from the `facts` in `FactsHolder` of the `OnheapIncrementalIndex`. When raw data has a lot of String dimension, the ingestion task (peon) can still OOM with default value of maxBytesInMemory. This is because the calculation of `estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize` in StringDimensionIndexer is underestimating the memory footprint of String. According to https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-codetoheap/index.html, String has the following memory usuage... 28 bytes of data for String metadata (class pointer, flags, locks, hash, count, offset, reference to char array) + 16 bytes of data for the char array metadata (class pointer, flags, locks, size) + 2 bytes for every letter of the string. (note that previously, we were only account for 2 bytes for every letter of the string)\r\n\r\nNote that the new implementation of `estimateEncodedKeyComponentSize` in StringDimensionIndexer has about the same performance. (OLD refers to the old calculation and New refers to the calculation proposed in this PR)\r\n \r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                        (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeOLD          10000          8  avgt   10  0.157 ± 0.014  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeNew          10000          8  avgt   10  0.148 ± 0.007  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                        (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeOLD          10000          1  avgt   10  0.022 ± 0.004  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeNew          10000          1  avgt   10  0.019 ± 0.001  us/op\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                        (cardinality)  (rowSize)  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeOLD          10000          4  avgt   10  0.073 ± 0.008  us/op\r\nStringDimensionIndexerBenchmark.estimateEncodedKeyComponentSizeNew          10000          4  avgt   10  0.070 ± 0.005  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This dynamic discovery is very user friendly. However, we have found, at my company, that on our multi-tenant cluster where many users submit ingestion jobs through a managed service that creates and submits ingestion specs, users can mistakenly start jobs that index more than they or we would like them to index in one job. For instance, a user may try to start a hadoop batch job that indexes a year of raw source data at hourly granularity. This generates up to 365 * 24 = 8,760 intervals that may have even more sharding within intervals. To combat this, we have decided to limit the number of segment intervals that a single HadoopIndexTask or IndexTask can create. We also limit the aggregate number of shards across the whole ingestion job when possible too. Doing so has allowed us to improve quality of service to our many tenants. Now we have decided to explore upstreaming a similar implementation of our tooling. Our thought is that we will open this PR and gauge the community interest in such a feature. I think others who run multi tenant clusters could benefit from this if merged.\r\n\r\n# Description of feature\r\n\r\nThese new configs are limited to only IndexTask (non-parallel) and HadoopIndexTask. While we have not fully explored implementation for ParallelIndexTask, it appears that it may be difficult or impossible to find a way to cleanly identify when and how to stop tasks if they hit limits.\r\n\r\nThe tuning config for the applicable tasks adds two new configurations.\r\n* `maxSegmentIntervalsPermitted`: The number of segment intervals that a single job can identify for ingest dynamically\r\n* `maxAggregateSegmentsPermitted`: The aggregate number of shards across all intervals a job can create if sharding is discovered dynamically before ingestion.\r\n\r\nThe limits are only applied when we are dynamically discovering the scope of what is going to be ingested from the raw source data:\r\n\r\n* IndexTask\r\n  * maxSegmentIntervalsPermitted\r\n    * Dynamic partitioning + null intervals\r\n    * Hashed partitioning + null intervals\r\n  * maxAggregateSegmentsPermitted\r\n    * Hashed partitioning + numShards == null\r\n * HadoopIndexTask\r\n   * maxSegmentIntervalsPermitted\r\n     * single_dim partitioning + non-null intervals\r\n     * hashed partitioning + numShards == null\r\n   * maxAggregateSegmentsPermitted\r\n     * single_dim partitioning + non-null intervals\r\n     * hashed partitioning + numShards == null\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n\r\n* Does not work for ParallelIndexTask\r\n* Is very niche feature. Since spec is user submitted, a user on a multi-tenant cluster may not feel need to use this config and they will continue on being bad actor. However, clusters with a services layer built in between user and druid that have have control over the final ingestion spec and can add key:value pairs like this as needed to enable this feature.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nThis PR improves `ExpressionVectorValueSelector` and `ExpressionVectorObjectSelector` to re-use evaluation results for the same selector. While I haven't measured this at all, it makes a relatively big difference when `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false` just because the previous behavior meant that the expression was evaluated twice for numeric primitive expressions: once to get the value vector and again to get the null vector. I was aware of this issue but didn't get to it in the first round of additions I did for the vectorized expression stuffs and sort of forgot about it until now 😅 .\r\n\r\nIt works by expanding `Expr.VectorInputBinding` to further mimic `ReadableVectorOffset`:\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns an integer that uniquely identifies the current position of the underlying vector offset, if this\r\n     * binding is backed by a segment. This is useful for caching: it is safe to assume nothing has changed in the\r\n     * offset so long as the id remains the same. See also: ReadableVectorOffset (in druid-processing)\r\n     */\r\n    int getCurrentVectorId();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich allows slightly modifying the backing of the `ExpressionVectorInputBinding` implementation to be based on `ReadableVectorOffset` which has a `getId` method, instead of `VectorSizeInspector` which only offers current and max vector size.\r\n\r\nThe size inspector provided by `VectorColumnSelectorFactory.getVectorSizeInspector` was already a `ReadableVectorOffset`, but to avoid exposing the entire offset interface which isn't going to be useful for most callers, I have added a new interface, `ReadableVectorInspector`, and pushed `getId` to it, reworked the method into `getReadableVectorInspector`.\r\n\r\nWith an identifier in place, the selectors can cache evaluation results and re-use them as long as the underlying offset does not change.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ExpressionVectorValueSelector`\r\n *

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for `ExpressionFilter` in vectorized query engines, and expands vectorization support for conditional expressions to support string typed columns.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the `Filter` interface method which checks if a matcher can be vectorized has been updated to accept a `ColumnInspector`, so that the `ExpressionVirtualColumn.canVectorize` method can do its thing to determine if the underlying expression can be vectorized:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  default boolean canVectorizeMatcher(ColumnInspector inspector)\r\n  {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpression filters on string typed expressions use a new `ObjectVectorValueMatcher` (since string expressions most naturally use a `VectorObjectSelector` instead of the dictionary encoded vector dimension selectors), and `DruidPredicateFactory` has been updated to include a method to make an object matching predicate to work with that.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  default Predicate<Object> makeObjectPredicate()\r\n  {\r\n    // default to try to use string predicate;\r\n    final Predicate<String> stringPredicate = makeStringPredicate();\r\n    return o -> stringPredicate.apply((String) o);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `VectorColumnProcessorFactory` has been expanded with a new method to allow constructing these `VectorObjectSelector` based matchers:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  T makeObjectProcessor(ColumnCapabilities capabilities, VectorObjectSelector selector);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI imagine that this potentially opens the door to someday having filters that could support any of the complex typed columns we support as inputs as well using the predicate factory pattern, though I haven't really spent time thinking of any use cases for this yet.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR fixes a bug when using a vectorizable string typed expression virtual column as an input to a filter, where the virtual column would report itself as vectorizable, but then not have implemented a single value dictionary selector. Instead, these non-dictionary string columns will now use the string object selector and should work correctly now. I've added additional virtual column inputs to filter tests to cover this case as well.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Filter`\r\n * `ExpressionFilter`\r\n *

After historical crashes in the process of downloading/creating segment files and startup again with lazyOnStart enable, there will no corrupted segments left on Historical disk.\r\n2. If served segments is damaged like manually damage `meta.smoosh` maliciously, Historical node with lazyOnStart enable will startup successfully but queries using these segments would fail at runtime.\r\n\r\nHere is the work flow of historical server loading segments.\r\n<img width=\"1783\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-11-26 下午5 30 08\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/100340728-94df2d80-3016-11eb-8a57-91fe7aeb2a3f.png\">\r\n\r\nCondition 1: When Historical Server re-start, it will try to load local cached segments listed in `info_dir`.\r\nCondition 2: Historical will create a specific file named by a corresponding segmentID in `info_dir` after downloading/creating segment files successfully.\r\n\r\nIf Historical crashed  in the process of downloading/creating segment files before `info_dir file` created, Historical would not try to load this segments when startup lazily. And the loading action of this segment will be triggered by ZKCurator which is a unLazy action.\r\nUn-lazy loading action will throw exception because of damaged segment files.\r\n```\r\n2020-11-26T05:37:45,121 INFO [SimpleDataSegmentChangeHandler-26] org.apache.druid.server.coordination.SegmentLoadDropHandler - Loading segment

Description\r\nThis PR picks up the commit from #10230, which adds bitwise math functions (`bitwiseAnd`, `bitwiseComplement` , `bitwiseOr`, `bitwiseShiftLeft`, `bitwiseShiftRight`, `bitwiseXor`) to the Druid native expression system, and adds `bitwiseConvertDoubleToLongBits` and `bitwiseConvertLongBitsToDouble` to allow use with double typed columns.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've added vectorization support so these expressions can be utilized in vectorized query engines, as well as tests.\r\n\r\nI'll save adding SQL support as a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nRelated #8560\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the Docker entrypoint script generated the config files, it would append the configuration without including a newline. This could result in incorrect configuration. This has been fixed by always appending a newline before any edited configuration.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a variable was set in Docker to change the zookeeper URL to `zookeeper`, the script would edit the `_common/common.runtime.properties` file so that the last line looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.lookup.enableLookupSyncOnStartup=falsedruid.zk.service.host=localhost\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn startup, Druid would crash because it would try to parse the string `falsedruid.zk.service.host=localhost` as a Boolean.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the script now correctly outputs this at the end of the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.lookup.enableLookupSyncOnStartup=false\r\ndruid.zk.service.host=localhost\r\n```\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#10494.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**Note:** This PR only affects tests and benchmarks.\r\nIt would help developers evaluate incremental-index extensions, such as oak-incremental-index (#10001).\r\n\r\n#10335 added a per incremental-index builder, but the parent class builder (`IncrementalIndex.Builder`) was not removed to avoid 100+ line changes in the test code.\r\nThis PR removes `IncrementalIndex.Builder` and refactor all its usage (only in tests the test/benchmarks code).\r\nIn addition, where needed, a parametrization was added so it will test/benchmark both builder implementations (on-heap and off-heap).\r\n\r\n#### Add test cases for each index type\r\nAll tests that are relevant to the incremental index were modified. The modifications include the parametrization of the tests for all incremental-index implementations: on-heap and off-heap. In addition, this PR includes a bug fix in `OffheapIncrementalIndex` that was found using these tests.\r\n\r\nTo support this, a new helper class was added: `IncrementalIndexCreator`.\r\nThis class handle creating the appropriate index according to its name and closing it at the end of each test.\r\n\r\n#### Add benchmark cases for each index type\r\nAll the benchmarks that are relevant to the incremental index were added an incremental-index parametrization: on-heap or off-heap.\r\nIn addition, some of these benchmarks were modified to resolve some issues that were encountered.\r\n\r\nWe list here the additional modifications we made to some of the benchmarks.\r\n\r\n  * Add some additional parametrization:\r\n     - rollup opportunity for the row generator\r\n     - number of rows per segment\r\n     - query order: descending/ascending\r\n  * Add a missing `tearDown()` procedure\r\n  * Properly close the queryable index in the `tearDown()` procedure\r\n  * Moved any temporary folder creation and deletion to the `setup()`/`tearDown()` methods so they would not affect the measurements of the results\r\n  * Use a predefined seed for reproducible results, to be compliant with most benchmarks\r\n  * Add scopes (`@State(Scope.Benchmark)`) that allow us to test the incremental index without the overhead of the setup procedure of the queryable index benchmark\r\n     - One scope for benchmarking queries on the incremental index\r\n     - One scope for benchmarking queries on the queryable index\r\n\r\nIn addition, to reduce code duplications, a few methods were added to `DataGenerator`:\r\n\r\n1. `void addToIndex(IncrementalIndex<?> index, int numOfRows)`: adds rows from this generator to an existing index\r\n1. `List<InputRow> toList(int numOfRows)`: adds rows from this generator to a new list\r\n\r\n## User Experience Changes\r\nAfter this PR, the user should not expect changes in most benchmarks results.\r\nHowever, some benchmarks behavior will change as follows:\r\n\r\n### Runtime\r\nExpected change: the following benchmarks will run much faster due to eliminating redundancy setup/teardown procedure calls.\r\nHowever, the benchmarks reported results should not change.\r\n`FilteredAggregatorBenchmark`, `GroupByBenchmark`, `ScanBenchmark`, `SearchBenchmark`, `TimeseriesBenchmark`, `TopNBenchmark`\r\n\r\n### Parametrization\r\nExpected change: the following benchmarks will have additional parametrization options, hence they might take longer to run and produce more results.\r\n* `indexType` parametrization (will also test the off-heap implementation): `FilteredAggregatorBenchmark`, `IncrementalIndexRowTypeBenchmark`, `IncrementalIndexReadBenchmark`, `IndexIngestionBenchmark`, `IndexPersistBenchmark`, `GroupByBenchmark`, `ScanBenchmark`, `SearchBenchmark`, `TimeseriesBenchmark`, `TopNBenchmark`\r\n* `descending` query parametrization: `FilteredAggregatorBenchmark`, `TimeseriesBenchmark`\r\n* `rollupOpportunity` ingestion parametrization: `IndexIngestionBenchmark`\r\n\r\n### Unified Benchmarks Behaviour\r\nExpected change: these changes affect some of the benchmarks' reported results as follows:\r\n\r\n* A `rowsPerSegment` parametrization was added to `IncrementalIndexRowTypeBenchmark`. Before the number of rows was not parametrized and it reported the time per single row insertion. Now it reports the total insertion time of all the rows, like the rest of the tests report.\r\n* `ScanBenchmark`, `SearchBenchmark`, `GroupByBenchmark`: now using a fixed seed, so the results are reproducible but might be slightly different than what was before with the random seed.\r\n* `IndexPersistBenchmark`: this benchmark previously cleaned the temporary data folder inside the tested method, instead of in the teardown procedure. For large index sizes, it affected the benchmark result significantly. With this modification, the results will be different (shorter times), but it will better reflect the \"persist\" performance.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows Parallel task to run without explicit intervals in granularitySpec. If intervals are missing, the parallel task executes an extra step for input sampling which collects the intervals to index.\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally fixes a bug when `numShards` is missing in hash partitioning. When `numShards` is missing, the parallel task computes it by scanning the whole input. However, the computed numShards was ignored when it's serialized into JSON. To fix it, this PR adds another field `intervalToNumShardsOverride` which stores the computed numShards per interval so that we can handle data skew well across intervals.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

reordering in the `Schema` step\r\n- Default data loader flow to ingest with `rollup: false`\r\n- Added ability to `AutoForm` to fold things into a \"Show more\" folder\r\n- Fixed bug where `totalNumMergeTasks`, and `maxNumSegmentsToMerge` were not showing up in the form\r\n- Extracted all the data loader callout messages into their own file for easy editing\r\n- Fix issue where all the tables were constantly being re-mounted (losing scroll position / column sizing)\r\n- Misc improvements to data loader flow\r\n- Allow adding dimensions to dimensionExclusion list via point-and-click\r\n- Disallow submitting of an unfinished spec\r\n- Lower cased the segment granularities for aesthetics\r\n- Extracted dynamic configs to the `druid-modals` directory\r\n- Added `repartitionTransitionDuration` to the form - it was missing\r\n- Added helpful warnings for non newline delimited

This will alter some of the metrics that are emitted by Druid (adding a dimension that was not previously there). Clients should plan to handle this new `context` dimension in their metrics pipeline. Since the dimension is a `json` formatted string, it is common for clients to parse the dimension and either flatten it or extract the bits they want and discard the full `json` formatted string blob.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nI was working on a contribution that involves this class and realized that the test `getRandomBalancerSegmentHolderTest` had some issues.\r\n\r\nIt was doing a bunch of recordings on mocks but not actually verifying any of them. Turns out that the recordings were bad so adding verify broke the test. After analyzing the code, I believe the recordings were done in error. Maybe copy/paste or by mistake? Either way, the expected methods cannot possibly be called by the code under test. I removed the non-applicable recordings for the mocks and added verification of them. The test still does what it was meant to at its core... which seems to test that this method will select segments in a pseudo random manner and given enough iterations all segments provided may be selected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR to #10464.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new query metric `query/timeout/count` that represents the number of timed out queries during the emission period. Timed out query counts were previously clubbed under `query/interrupted/count`. Having a separate metric for timed out queries can make it a little easier for cluster operators to diagnose query issues better.\r\n\r\nMarking this as `Incompatible` as `query/interrupted/count` no longer represents timed out query counts and user defined alerting/reports may need to be adjusted to factor in `query/timeout/count` along with `query/interrupted/count`.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to add metricsMonitors to integration tests so that it provides better testing for PRs such as this.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

And open source druid(from 0.15.0 to 0.20.0) only can support to consume messages from Kafka 0.11.x or better. And when consume Kafka 0.10.2.1, it throws UnsupportedVersionException :\r\n```json\r\n2020-11-03T07:40:03,539 WARN [KafkaSupervisor-xxxxx] org.apache.druid.indexing.seekablestream.supervisor.SeekableStreamSupervisor - Exception in supervisor run loop for dataSource [xxxxx]\r\norg.apache.druid.indexing.seekablestream.common.StreamException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: The broker does not support LIST_OFFSETS with version in range [2,5].

The supported range is [0,1].\r\n```\r\nAnd as the Druid docs says \r\n```\r\nThe Kafka indexing service supports transactional topics which were introduced in Kafka 0.11.x. These changes make the Kafka consumer that Druid uses incompatible with older brokers. Ensure that your Kafka brokers are version 0.11.x or better before using this functionality. Refer Kafka upgrade guide if you are using older version of Kafka brokers.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this exception (SDK 2.6.0 + Kafka 0.10.2.1) is Hard-coded ‘props.put(\"isolation.level\", \"read_committed\");’ in the ‘KafkaConsumerConfigs’ which is unnecessary.\r\nThis PR adds a new config named `consumeTransactionally ` in `KafkaIndexTaskIOConfig`. Default is true, druid can consume Kafka topics consumeTransactionally same as current Druid behavior. And users can set this config false. Set `consumeTransactionally` false here can disable druid to consume Kafka in a transactional way. And druid could consume lower version of Kafka now, such as 0.10.2.1, like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"kafka\",\r\n  \"dataSchema\": {\r\n    \"dataSource\": \"metrics-kafka\",\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #10530 by removing internal checking of zero period for `TIMESTAMPADD` SQL function and `timestamp_shift` native query.\r\n\r\nAs is described in the issue, `TIMESTAMPADD` uses shared code `PeriodGranularity`, which does not allow zero period for user configuration, to hold arguments passed to it. To fix the issue in a simple way, period and timezone are extracted from given arguments respectively instead of creating a `PeriodGranularity` object to hold them together.\r\n\r\nAnd also, there's another slight improvement in code where `TIMESTAMPADD` SQL is converted to native query `timestamp_shift` function call. By detecting SQL AST ahead, a period string such as `P1M` is generated instead of calling of `concat` function.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9053 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPlease read #9053 first and maybe https://groups.google.com/g/druid-development/c/tWnwPyL0Vk4/m/2uLwqgQiAAAJ?pli=1 for more background on HTTP based segment and task management that were introduced before.\r\n\r\nThis patch has been tested to successfully run a small Druid Test cluster with K8S and without Zookeeper. \r\n\r\nMost of the code introduced here goes in a new extension. At a high level, it introduces a new Druid Kubernetes Extension that implements 3 druid discovery and leader election related interfaces... \"DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider\", \"DruidLeaderSelector\", \"DruidNodeAnnouncer\" and provides necessary plumbing to use those when configured.\r\n\r\nInternally, it uses https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java for all the kubernetes interactions and https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/tree/master/extended/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/extended/leaderelection for the leader election.\r\n\r\nSee `kubernetes.md` for how to use it. It can support multiple Druid clusters running on same K8S cluster [in same namespace].\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Protocol buffers have much less overhead than Json and thus I would expect the transfer rate to be increased when using it. I'll try to build some benchmarking tools to test this, circumstantial evidence from test suites seems to indicate a speed increase:\r\n\r\n```\r\n... Time elapsed: 14.753 s - in org.apache.druid.sql.avatica.DruidAvaticaJsonHandlerTest\r\n... Time elapsed: 11.482 s - in org.apache.druid.sql.avatica.DruidAvaticaProtobufHandlerTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a side note, for the officially supported [Avatica Golang driver](https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica-go) there isn't any Json serialisation support and thus will only work with this patch.\r\n\r\nI was forced to add `org.apache.calcite.avatica` to druid-server in order to parse the pb messages and retrieve the connection id. The connection id is used to stabilise the choice of brokers when the request goes through the router.\r\n\r\nOne further note, I've chosen to add another url (`/druid/v2/sql/avatica-pb/`) for protocol buffers, ideally it would simply be controlled with a `content-type`, that is unfortunately not implemented in the JDBC driver so it will not work for the time being, however, the aforementioned golang driver does send content-type as `application/x-google-protobuf`.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

exposed only within VPN. \r\n\r\nthis PR adds a new config `druid.ingestion.http.allowListDomains` and  `druid.ingestion.http.denyListDomains` which allows/deny configured IP/domains from being

PR fixes an issue that in the data loader if you toggle the rollup it loses any previously entered type information because it will simply rescan the sample. It makes a couple of other fixes also.\r\nThis work was done as a result of 2 user studies where people loaded data into Druid via the data loader and then user a couple of other parts of the console.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactors all the druid concepts into the `druid-modals` directory and breaks them up a bit so they are not just huge files (bad code smell).\r\n\r\nIn addition to that this PR also:\r\n- Adds a `Partitioning` column (derived from `shardSpec`) to the segment view (see screenshot)\r\n- Adds a `Segment granularity` column to the datasource view (see screenshot)\r\n- Creates a framework where auto form fields could be used to verify the modal reducing redundancy\r\n- Adds an optional validator prop to the `JsonInput` to let it surface higher level errors\r\n- Allows for using a `__time` transform in the parse time step of the data loader\r\n- Fixes the issue the it was not possible to edit the `tuningConfig.partitionsSpec.type` from the `Edit spec` step of the data loader\r\n- Adds `oneOf` utility function to make `AutoForm` definitions more succinct \r\n- Fixes the height of the icons in the data loader splash screen so it does not bounce\r\n- Uses the improved escaping from druid-query-toolkit to make data view tables' filtering better\r\n- Fixes some typos\r\n\r\n### Partitioning column\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/97240597-ebedaa80-17ab-11eb-976f-a0d49d6d1a40.png)\r\n\r\n### Segment granularity

It has a few limitations :\r\n1.  When supervisor is running, we can't modify the task count number. We may meet data lag during sudden peak traffic period. Users have to re-submit the supervisor with a larger task number, aiming to catch up Kafka delay. But if there are too many supervisors, this re-submit operation is very complicated. In addition do scale in action manually after sudden traffic peak.\r\n2. In order to avoid Kafka lag during regular traffic peak, users have to set a large task count in supervisors. So that it will cause the waste of resource during regular traffic off-peak.\r\nFor example, \r\n<img width=\"1479\" alt=\"traffic-pattern\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/96677861-09cda080-13a3-11eb-9a88-d18ead0906db.png\">\r\nHere is our traffic pattern. I have to set taskCount to 8, avoiding Kafka lag during traffic peak. At other times, 4 tasks are enough.\r\nThis PR provides the ability of auto scaling the number of Kafka ingest tasks based on Lag metrics when supervisors are running. Enable this feature and ingest tasks will auto scale out during traffic peak and scale in during traffic off-peak.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nHere are the designs of this PR:\r\nThe work flow of supervisor controller based on druid source code\r\n<img width=\"1324\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-10-21 下午1 44 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/96679250-de988080-13a5-11eb-9d72-4c9396ef1177.png\">\r\nAs the picture shows, SupervisorManger controls all the supervisors in OverLord Service. Each Kafka Supervisor serially consume notices in LinkedBlockingQueue. Notice is an interface. RunNotice, ShutdownNotice and RestNotice are implementations of this interface. I design a new implementation named DynamicAllocationTasksNotice.

This is why the figure2 shows a peak of 4 from 10:38 to 10:42(3 new reading tasks and one writing task) and a peak of 5 from 11:06 to 11:08. In fact, what we really care about is the tasks in reading state. In other words, the real peak of task number is 3 all the time, which scale out at 10:39 due to Kafka lag and there is no gap between the traffic peak and task peak.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nHere are the benefits of Druid Auto Scale :\r\n1. Help improve data SLA: whenever there is heavy traffic, Druid can scale out automatically and sensitively  to provide stronger consuming power so that there is no delay for downstream.\r\n2. Resource Saving :\r\n    * Cost Saving, because the task number of each datasource is reduced, so that there is no need for as many task solts as before.\r\n    * Support Resource Saving, the entire process from scale out action to scale in action does not require human intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds [grouping_id function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/grouping-id-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)  in both SQL and native query layer. The function is modeled as an aggregate function, similar to how it is done in Calcite. Unlike regular aggregate functions, this one takes the grouping dimensions as arguments. \r\n\r\nThere were different ways, the aggregator result could have materialized for a particular subtotal spec. I initially tried putting the logic in the merge function inside `GroupByBinaryFnV2`.  That didn't work though since many input rows do not need merging if the grouping key is seen only once. So I have now added the logic as and when we iterate through base rows, modifying the dimensions and grouping aggregator at the same time. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

compaction integration test CI timeout\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCompaction integration test intermittently timeout (Travis job stuck until timeout of 50 minutes and/or Travis job terminates after 10 mins of not receiving new output) due to one of the test submitting/running too many tasks at the same time. Specifically, the test submits range partitioning compaction tasks with 2 subtasks each (for a total of 6 tasks). This causes the cluster to intermittently fails. I am not sure what is the _real_ maximum number of tasks the Druid cluster running in Travis can handle. It probably also depends on the type of tasks too. Anyhow, changed the task to only have 1 subtask each (for a total of 4 tasks) and the intermittent failure is now fixed.\r\n\r\nPlease see below for Travis build with 72 compaction integration test.\r\n- Without any change from this PR. We can see that about 25% failed due to the above issue. https://travis-ci.org/github/maytasm/druid/builds/735867518\r\n- Removing the test that submits range partitioning compaction tasks with 2 subtasks each (for a total of 6 tasks). We can see that 100% passed. https://travis-ci.org/github/maytasm/druid/builds/736172442\r\n- Changing the range partitioning compaction tasks to 1 subtask each.

is a style pass and color overhaul for the console. It was about time that a professional designer took a look at the console. The aim of this work was to make the console style tie in better with the Druid brand colors and to tighten up all the miscellaneous paddings and margins all over the place.\r\n\r\nThe true heavy lifting of this styling was was done by @asherbitter and all credit goes to him. I just helped with things like updating package versions and importing the new font.\r\n\r\n![localhost_18081_unified-console html(Doc screenshot)

The home view icons are now Druid brand colored\r\n- The logo in the top left corner was tightened up\r\n\r\n![localhost_18081_unified-console html(Doc screenshot)

the panels are much better defined\r\n- The padding in this view was tightened up\r\n- The font in the console has been changed from `apple system default` to Open Sans an open source (Apache-2.0) font which has monospaced numbers allowing us to align the numeric columns really nicely\r\n- Notice the flat buttons - the gradients have been removed as is the more modern style\r\n\r\n![localhost_18081_unified-console html(Doc screenshot) (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/96206474-cd6ef000-0f1d-11eb-9fa0-cf6f2b080f91.png)\r\n\r\n- One of the table

#10493 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplements better support for Avro unions in the Avro extensions.\r\nCurrently when ingesting data that contains unions unless the union is always the same value it will return mixed type results.\r\nThis PR addresses the problem by exploding union fields into maps keyed by the union member type or type name in the case of named types (enums, fixed, records).\r\nThe method was chosen as it's similar to what is done on other systems that support ingesting Avro data, such as Google BigQuery which details their Avro compatibility here: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-avro#avro_conversions\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n-

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for vectorizing expressions in cases where inputs are missing, using either null or default values as inputs, depending on the value of `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes non-vectorized expression type handling a bit more consistent across different types of expressions. Major changes here include operator expressions will now try to preserve the type when one of the arguments is null instead of always producing double values, and math functions now follow logic similar to the operators. \r\n\r\nTagging PR as release notes/incompatible because the changes cause some expressions to output slightly different results (typically longs instead of doubles). Examples:\r\n`longColumn + nonExistentColumn -> longColumn + 0L` instead of `(double) longColumn + 0.0`\r\n\r\nand math functions will produce output from non-existent inputs in default mode instead of always producing zeros:\r\n`max(longColumn, nonExistentColumn) -> max(longColumn, 0L)`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

of the general problem of Increase reusability of retention rule configurations is here [Issue #10237 ](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10237)\r\nThis pull request implements a new rule type that imports rules from any other rule set, including rules from other data sources. The back end code is the same as the previous PR #10129 and the UI changes have been ported to incorporate the recent UI changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis branch adds a new ImportRule type that specifies an imported rule set. Whenever rules are used, they are expanded to include the default rules for the cluster. This changes the getRulesWithDefault to also expand any import rules found at the time they are retrieved. This is functionally equivalent to the original list as the rules are replaced before evaluation. Rules are also used in CoordinatorRuleManager in the router, where getRulesWithDefault was implemented again. Here, that implementation is left at one place, in SQLRuleManager and a new method is added to RulesResource to allow CoordinatorRuleManager to retrieve the expanded list of rules without knowing how it was generated. \r\n\r\nIn the implementation, the function of getRulesWithDefault has diverged a little bit from the name, maybe a name like getExpandedRules would be better. Also, the implementation for ImportRule is specifically in SQLMetadataRuleManager maybe it should be interface methods or in a utility class for use by other implementations in the future. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"743\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-07 at 2 46 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8482587/95377733-f99cc800-08b0-11eb-9a1d-c8132a9de54d.png\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
