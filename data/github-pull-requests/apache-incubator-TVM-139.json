a few of our topi testcases relies on a reference numpy/scipy implementation which can be quite slow. This PR introduce a memoize function that tries to remember the input result pair generated by the function and pickle them to a ```.pkl_memoize_py2```  (or py3) folder, so next time function is called, the result is fetched from cache. This can enable cache across multiple run of testcase if CI workspace is preserved (which is our case)\r\n\r\nThe cache is done with keys in closure and function arguments, I have updated the testcases to use this syntax. In order to guarantee correctness, the restriction is that the memoized function can only capture or take int, str, float or tuple of them and these are used as cache

enables double buffering pre-fetching.

One advantage of double buffering is that the logic explicit prefetchs next stage's input to the shared memory buffer.\r\n\r\nSource\r\n```c++\r\nfor (i, 0, 100) {\r\n  allocate B[float32 * 4]\r\n  for (i, 0, 4) {\r\n    B[i] = A[((i*4) + i)]\r\n  }\r\n  for (i, 0, 4) {\r\n    A[i] = (B[i] + 1.000000f)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTarget\r\n```c++\r\nallocate B[float32 * 2 * 4]\r\nfor (i, 0, 4) {\r\n  B[i] = A[i]\r\n}\r\nfor (i, 0, 99) { \r\n  // prefetch next iteration\r\n  for (i, 0, 4) {\r\n    B[((((i + 1) % 2)*4) + i)] = A[(((i*4) + i) + 4)]\r\n  }\r\n  for (i, 0, 4) {\r\n    A[i] = (B[(((i % 2)*4) + i)] + 1.000000f)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i, 0, 4) {\r\n  A[i] = (B[(i + 4)] + 1.000000f)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nUsually when GPU fetches memory, there is a big latency before the data arrives. There are two ways to hide this cost:\r\n- Context switch to another GPU thread on the same block, this requires us to launch many GPU threads, limiting the resources(registers) used on each block\r\n- Do double buffering, to prefetch the data needed in next iteration.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradeoff here. Bigger tiles means more resources(registers) and more reuse, but harder to hide loading cost (because we launch less threads). Smaller tiles means more threads and easier to hide loading cost but less reuse. \r\n\r\nEnable double buffering allows us to get bigger tiles and more reuse with less requirement on the context switch.\r\n\r\nSo directly enable it may not speedup things(because the old schedule is tuned to contain enough thread to hide the latency). We might need to enable it and also increase tile size to get a schedule with more reuse and also hide loading
