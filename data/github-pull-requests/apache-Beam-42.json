the capacity for the buffered logger to print directly to the console or write directly over the logging service if available to cover the last print statements in the script. Routes through a buffered logger type to support the container prebuild workflow. Also adds the ability to periodically flush output during long-running operations (like PIP dependency resolution) rather than waiting for the end of the process. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Directly calling setup.py for installing the Python package is deprecated. python setup.py install will throw a warning:\r\n```\r\nSetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: setup.py install is deprecated.\r\nUse build and pip and other standards-based tools.\r\n```\r\n* The new replacement for setup.py is PEP 517 and PEP 621.\r\n     * PEP 621: The package's metadata is now specified in pyproject.toml. The TOML file is declarative and cannot contain arbitrary code unlike setup.py.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides\r\n1. Replace `setup.py sdist` with [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/). This will install the build dependencies in an isolated environments and then generates sdist. Setuptools itself strongly suggests using this and to avoid using `setup.py sdist` since it is treated as deprecated. You can find more at https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/245d72a8aa4d47e1811425213aba2a06a0bb64fa/docs/deprecated/commands.rst#L10\r\n   * Modify the CI to build the sdist with `python -m build` \r\n\r\n2. Remove the `build-requirements.txt` since we move those dependencies into `pyproject.toml`. \r\n3. Remove the code in `gen_protos.py` where we install `build dependencies`.  This is not required since build-requirements are always installed from pyporject.toml\r\n\r\nOther notable changes:\r\n* Change several Linux-based unit test suites to install SDK from a wheel. This speeds up suites consisting of multiple isolated builds by reusing the the binary distribution that is built once for entire suite.\r\n* `grpcio` is not importable during distribution creation, therefore call `gen_protos.py` in a subprocess. \r\n* The format of sdist is changed from `.zip` to `.tar.gz` since we are going to use `build` module for building sdist\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/20051\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26266\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses #28080 by removing an unnecessary try/block. The code in question updates a watermark via a callback wherein a SpannerException is caught and logged via a warning. Nothing in the tried code throws a SpannerException. Alternatively, a IllegalStateException could have been caught or thrown. However, analyzing the code further didn't suggest any thrown Runtime related exceptions.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
