Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10217\r\n\r\nThis pr does two things:\r\n1. Support `desc function s3()`\r\n2. modify the syntax of tvf\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Support `desc function s3()`\r\nUse `desc function s3()` to get table schema of S3 table valued function. It likes:\r\n```\r\nMySQL [(none)]> desc function s3(\"URI\" = \"http://127.0.0.1:9312/test2/student_with_names.csv\",\"ACCESS_KEY\"= \"minioadmin\", \"SECRET_KEY\" = \"minioadmin\", \"FORMAT\" = \"csv_with_names\");\r\n+-------+------+------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n| Field | Type | Null | Key   | Default | Extra |\r\n+-------+------+------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n| id    | TEXT | Yes  | false | NULL    | NONE  |\r\n| name  | TEXT | Yes  | false | NULL    | NONE  |\r\n| age   | TEXT | Yes  | false | NULL    | NONE  |\r\n+-------+------+------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n3 rows in set (0.32 sec)\r\n```\r\n2. modify the syntax of tvf\r\nIn the old syntax, the params of tvf is fixed order and is not flexible enough for S3 tvf. So, We change the syntax of table valued function. \r\n\r\nFor numbers tvf:\r\n```\r\n// old syntax:\r\nnumbers(\"n\", \"m\")\r\n\r\n// new syntax:\r\nnumbers(\r\n  \"number\" = \"n\",\r\n  \"backend_num\" = \"m\"\r\n  );\r\n```\r\nFor S3 tvf:\r\n```\r\n// old syntax:\r\ns3(\"http://127.0.0.1:9312/test2/student_with_names.csv\", \"minioadmin\",  \"minioadmin\", \"csv_with_names\");\r\n\r\n// new syntax:\r\ns3(\r\n\"URI\" = \"http://127.0.0.1:9312/test2/student_with_names.csv\",\r\nACCESS_KEY\"= \"minioadmin\", \r\n\"SECRET_KEY\" = \"minioadmin\", \r\n\"FORMAT\" = \"csv_with_names\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-07T13:54:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T06:12:43Z","closed_at":"2022-11-09T06:12:43Z","merged_at":"2022-11-09T06:12:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b74d0a4747ef77d589295d9516d180f33b5bfcec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1693771265,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkzNzcxMjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/docs","name":"kind/docs","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

These memory are consumed when initializing page builder, as it reserves 1MB for each column. So memory consumption grows in proportion with column number. Shrinking the reservation may reduce memory substantially in load process, as shown in the test results listed below. \r\n\r\nShrinking will not limit the size of dict page size -- it could still grow when needed. Thus, we can make the most of dict encoding while achive reasonable memory consumption. No performance degrading is observed in the tests, proving buffer growth brings little overheads.\r\n\r\nWe believe this commit will make Doris more capable for larger load concurrency.\r\n\r\nTest config:\r\n\r\n| CPU  | Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8255C CPU @ 2.50GHz 96 core        |\r\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| RAM  | 375G                                                         |\r\n| SSD  | Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NVMe SSD Controller PM9A1/PM9A3/980PRO |\r\n| Data | GithubEvent, 3.1G single json, 664 columns, dict size will trigger buffer growth |\r\n\r\nTest results:\r\n\r\n- single load\r\n\r\n  |                  | Resv 1M  (original) | Resv 64K + Grow |\r\n  | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |\r\n  | LoadTime:        | 99.4s               | 94.7s (-5%)     |\r\n  | Peak ProcessMem: | 12G                 | 11G (-1G)       |\r\n  | Peak LoadMem:    | 17G                 | 13G (-4G)       |\r\n  | Peak Orphan:     | 11G                 | 8G (-3G)        |\r\n\r\n- multiple loads (concurrency = 10)\r\n\r\n  |                  | Resv 1M  (original) | Resv 64K + Grow |\r\n  | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |\r\n  | LoadTime:        | 183.2s              | 182.9s (-1%)    |\r\n  | Peak ProcessMem: | 80G                 | 73G (-7G)       |\r\n  | Peak LoadMem:    | 55G                 | 51G (-4G)       |\r\n  | Peak Orphan:     | 57G                 | 54G (-4G)       |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n### 1. add a post processor: runtime filter pruner \r\n\r\nDoris generates RFs (runtime filter) on Join node to reduce the probe table at scan stage. But some RFs have no effect, because its selectivity is 100%. This pr will remove them.\r\nA RF is effective if\r\n1. the build column value range covers part of that of probe column, OR\r\n2. the build column ndv is less than that of probe column, OR\r\n3. the build column's ColumnStats.selectivity < 1, OR\r\n4. the build column is reduced by another RF, which satisfies above criterions.\r\n\r\n### 2. explain graph\r\n1. add RF info in Join and Scan node\r\n2. add predicate count in Scan node\r\n\r\n### 3. Rename session variable\r\n rename `enable_remove_no_conjuncts_runtime_filter_policy` to `enable_runtime_filter_prune` \r\n\r\n### 4. fix min/max column stats derive bug\r\n`select max(A) as X from T group by B`  \r\nX.min is A.min, not A.max\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

twice\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen the load mem hard limit reached, all load channel should wait on the lock of LoadChannelMgr, util current reduce mem work finished. In current implementation, there's a bug might cause some threads be woke up before reduce mem work finished:\r\n1. thread A found that soft limit reached, picked a load channel and waiting for reduce memory work finish.\r\n2. The memory keep increasing\r\n3. thread B found that hard limit reached (either the load mem hard limit, or process soft limit), it picked a load channel to reduce memory and set the variable `_should_wait_flush` to true\r\n4. thread C found that `_should_wait_flush` is true, waiting on `_wait_flush_cond`\r\n5. thread A finished it's reduce memory work, found that `_should_wait_flush` is true, set it to false, and notify all threads.\r\n6. thread C is woke up and pick a load channel to do the reduce memory work, and now thread B's work is not finished.\r\n\r\nWe can see 2 threads doing reduce memory work when hard limit reached, it's quite confusing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n8. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n9. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n10. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n11. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #10217\r\npr Number: close #10214\r\n\r\nThis pr does three things：\r\n\r\n1. Modified the framework of table-valued-function(tvf).\r\n2. be support `fetch_table_schema` rpc.\r\n3. Implemented `S3(path, AK, SK, format)` table-valued-function.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Modified the framework of table-valued-function(tvf).\r\nEach implementation of tvf requires a new `scan node` in the old framework of pr #10214 . Actually, different `scan nodes` should correspond to different data sources. I modified the tvf framework so that it can generate different `scan node` according to data source of this tvf.\r\nFor example, the data of `numbers(n,m)` tvf is derived from memory, so it generate `DataGenScanNode`. And the data of `s3(...)` tvf is derived from S3 Storage, so it generate `ExternalFileScanNode`.\r\n\r\n2. be support `fetch_table_schema` rpc.\r\nThere is no table schema in `s3()` advance, so we need `fetch_table_schema` rpc to parse table schema from file in S3 Storage.\r\n\r\n3. `S3(path, AK, SK, format)`\r\nThe initial implement of `s3(..)` tvf, use like:\r\n```\r\nMySQL [(none)]> select * from s3(\"http://127.0.0.1:9312/test2/student1.csv\", \"minioadmin\", \"minioadmin\", \"csv\");\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n| c1   | c2   | c3   |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n| 1    | ftw  | 12   |\r\n| 2    | zs   | 18   |\r\n| 3    | ww   | 20   |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n3 rows in set (0.04 sec)\r\n\r\nMySQL [(none)]> select * from s3(\"http://127.0.0.1:9312/test2/student_with_names.csv\", \"minioadmin\", \"minioadmin\", \"csv_with_names\");\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n| id   | name | age  |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n| 1    | ftw  | 12   |\r\n| 2    | zs   | 18   |\r\n| 3    | ww   | 20   |\r\n+------+------+------+\r\n3 rows in set (0.04 sec)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-03T15:56:26Z","updated_at":"2022-11-06T03:04:27Z","closed_at":"2022-11-06T03:04:27Z","merged_at":"2022-11-06T03:04:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"27549564a7000778ed02ae2f379cbb1126ea7bcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

As a consequence, the result of `std::vector<std::string> paths(tok.begin(), tok.end())` ([be/src/exprs/json_functions.cpp#329](https://github.com/apache/doris/blob/master/be/src/exprs/json_functions.cpp#L329)) is wrong.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5.

off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nIn unit test, if set Config.allow_replica_on_same_host=true, we can just start multi BE on same host, and replica can be \r\ncreated and assigned  by these BEs. But tablet repair & balance process can not be executed cause of some methods will check if the dest BE is on the same host. But sometimes, we need to trigger tablet repair & balance process with a multi BE cluster in unit test. This pr is to fix these validations so we can trigger tablet repair & balance process with a multi BE cluster.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5.
