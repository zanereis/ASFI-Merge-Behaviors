for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### Migrate invalidLiteralForWindowDurationError to error classes. This error will now throw AnalysisException with error class INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.\r\n\r\n#### Update error handling logic in FunctionRegistry.scala to propagate the error class AnalysisExceptions.\r\n- Without this change, if invalidLiteralForWindowDurationError is migrated to error classes, the error will continue to spit out the old non error class AnalysisException (UT will fail).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nIn PR #26508 (SPARK-26260) the SHS stage metric percentiles were updated to only include successful tasks when using disk storage. It did this by making the values for each metric negative when the task is not in a successful state. This approach was chosen to avoid breaking changes to disk storage. See [this comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26508#issuecomment-554540314) for context.\r\n\r\nTo get the percentiles, it reads the metric values, starting at 0, in ascending order. This filters out all tasks that are not successful because the values are less than 0. To get the percentile values it scales the percentiles to the list index of successful tasks. For example if there are 200 tasks and you want percentiles [0, 25, 50, 75, 100] the lookup indexes in the task collection are [0, 50, 100, 150, 199].\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\nFor metrics 1) shuffle total reads and 2) shuffle total blocks, PR #26508 incorrectly makes the metric indices positive. This means tasks that are not successful are included in the percentile calculations. The percentile lookup index calculation is still based on the number of successful task so the wrong task metric is returned for a given percentile. This was not caught because the unit test only verified values for one metric, `executorRunTime`.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThe index values for `SHUFFLE_TOTAL_READS` and `SHUFFLE_TOTAL_BLOCKS` should not convert back to positive metric values for tasks that are not successful. I believe this was done because the metrics values are summed from two other metrics. Using the raw values still creates the desired outcome. `negative + negative = negative` and `positive + positive = positive`. There is no case where one metric will be negative and one will be positive. I also verified that these two metrics are only used in the percentile calculations where only successful tasks are used. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is required so that the SHS stage percentile metrics for shuffle read bytes and shuffle total blocks are correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user will see the correct percentile values for the stage summary shuffle read bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI updated the unit test to verify the percentile values for every task metric. I also modified the unit test to have unique values for every metric. Previously the test had the same metrics for every field. This would not catch bugs like the wrong field being read by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nI manually validated the fix in the UI.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5604993/155433460-322078c5-1821-4f2e-8e53-8fc3902eb7fe.png)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5604993/155433491-25ce3acf-290b-4b83-a0a9-0f9b71c7af04.png)\r\n\r\nI manually validated the fix in the task summary API (`/api/v1/applications/application_123/1/stages/14/0/taskSummary\\?quantiles\\=0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0`).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPass an `IndexedSeq` (likely a `Vector`) to `ExtractWindowExpressions.extract` and `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow` rather than whatever sequence type was specified by the user (in the `Dataset.select` method).\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, we only need to pass an `IndexedSeq` to `ExtractWindowExpressions.extract`. `ExtractWindowExpressions.extract` will then return another `IndexedSeq` that we will pass on to `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider this query:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 20).map { x =>\r\n  (x % 4, x + 1, x + 2)\r\n}.toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions._\r\n\r\nval w = Window.partitionBy(\"a\").orderBy(\"b\")\r\nval selectExprs = Stream(\r\n  sum(\"c\").over(w.rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)).as(\"sumc\"),\r\n  avg(\"c\").over(w.rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)).as(\"avgc\")\r\n)\r\n\r\ndf.select(selectExprs: _*).show(false)\r\n```\r\nIt fails with\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) avgc#23 missing from c#16L,a#14L,b#15L,sumc#21L in operator !Project [c#16L, a#14L, b#15L, sumc#21L, sumc#21L, avgc#23].;\r\n```\r\nIf you change `Stream` to a `Seq`, it succeeds.\r\n\r\nAs with SPARK-38221 and SPARK-38528, this is due to the use of this code pattern:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def someMethod (seq: Seq[xxx]) {\r\n    ...\r\n    val outerDataStructure = <create outer data structure>\r\n    val newSeq = seq.map { x =>\r\n      ...\r\n      code that puts something in outerDataStructure\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n    code that uses outerDataStructure (and expects it to be populated)\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIf `seq` is a `Stream`, `seq.map` might be evaluated lazily, in which case `outerDataStructure` will not be fully populated before it is used.\r\n\r\nBoth `ExtractWindowExpressions.extract` and `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow` use this pattern, but the above example failure is due to the pattern's use in `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow` (`extractedWindowExprBuffer` does not get fully populated, so the Window operator does not produce the output expected by its parent projection).\r\n\r\nI chose `IndexedSeq` not for its efficient indexing, but because `map` will eagerly iterate over it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.","created_at":"2022-02-23T21:27:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:19:35Z","closed_at":"2022-03-27T00:29:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32db840e7b0d62d54e4c11da0284287ca4ef2631","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/852595e9e202452d840901ad4a5c2b5202a8a175","head":{"label":"bersprockets:window_expression_stream_issue","ref":"window_expression_stream_issue","sha":"852595e9e202452d840901ad4a5c2b5202a8a175","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the ExpressionTypeCheckingSuite and CollectionExpressionsSuite under ANSI mode. \r\nFor all the failed test cases, wrap with ANSI as false. For some test cases, also add exact same test input wrapping with ANSI true, but set the expectation to the exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo set up a new GA job to run tests with ANSI mode before 3.3.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest locally with both ANSI on and off, both

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to use Java 17 in K8s integration tests by default when setting spark-tgz.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen setting parameters `spark-tgz` during integration tests, the error that `resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile.java17` cannot be found occurs. \r\n\r\nThis is due to the default value of `spark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile` is a [relative path](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/pom.xml#L46).\r\n\r\nWhen using the tgz, the working directory is [`$UNPACKED_SPARK_TGZ`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/scripts/setup-integration-test-env.sh#L90), and the relative path is invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nRuning k8s integration test manaully:\r\n#### sbt\r\n```shell\r\n$ build/sbt -Pkubernetes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35534 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35534#discussion_r809708015) that proposes to make `RuntimeReplaceableAggregate` as an add-on of `AggregateFunction`. \r\n\r\nNow, `ReplaceableAggregateFunction` is a mix-in for `AggregateFunction` that makes the expression can be replaced runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the hierarchy of class similar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested that it compiles fine. CI in this PR will test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR fixes the following tests under ANSI mode:\r\n* DataExpressionSuite, \r\n* NullExpressionsSuite, \r\n* StringExpressionsSuite, \r\n* ComplexTypesSuite, \r\n* CastSuite\r\n\r\nMost of them should only work with ANSI off. The fix wrap the corresponding code with\r\n```scala\r\nwithSQLConf(SQLConf.ANSI_ENABLED.key -> \"false\") {\r\n  // code only works under ANSI off\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `CastSuite` intentionally tests the case of ANSI off. The fix explicitly set ANSI off in `beforeAll` and reset it in `afterAll`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo set up a new GA job to run tests with ANSI mode before 3.3.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest locally with both ANSI on and off, both passed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-23T06:16:03Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T03:57:41Z","closed_at":"2022-02-25T03:57:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21b8178b87e40b01397cd1f33d400eeea4c01add","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/249f4469d9dec019a765ec98608b671004722ec4","head":{"label":"anchovYu:ansi-tests-multiple","ref":"ansi-tests-multiple","sha":"249f4469d9dec019a765ec98608b671004722ec4","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrapping the DataInputStream in the SparkPlan.decodeUnsafeRows method with a NextIterator as opposed to a plain Iterator, this will allow us to close the DataInputStream properly. This happens in Spark driver only.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-34647 replaced the ZstdInputStream with ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer. This meant that all usages of `CompressionCodec.compressedInputStream` would need to manually close the stream as this would no longer be handled by the finaliser mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn SparkPlan, the result of `CompressionCodec.compressedInputStream` is wrapped in an Iterator which never calls close. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Spark Shell Configuration\r\n```bash\r\n$> export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS=\"-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -Xms1g\"\r\n$> $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --conf spark.io.compression.codec=zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Test Script\r\n```scala\r\nimport java.sql.Timestamp\r\nimport java.time.Instant\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\ncase class Record(timestamp: Timestamp, batch: Long, value: Long)\r\n\r\n(1 to 300).foreach { batch =>\r\n  sc.parallelize(1 to 1000000).map(Record(Timestamp.from(Instant.now()), batch, _)).toDS.write.parquet(s\"test_data/batch_$batch\")\r\n}\r\n\r\n(1 to 300).foreach(batch => spark.read.parquet(s\"test_data/batch_$batch\").as[Record].repartition().collect())\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Memory Monitor\r\n```shell\r\n$> while true; do echo \\\"$(date +%Y-%m-%d' '%H:%M:%S)\\\",$(pmap -x <PID> | grep \"total kB\" | awk '{print $4}'); sleep 10; done;\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Results\r\n\r\n##### Before \r\n```\r\n\"2022-02-22 11:55:23\",1400016\r\n\"2022-02-22 11:55:33\",1522024\r\n\"2022-02-22 11:55:43\",1587812\r\n\"2022-02-22 11:55:53\",1631868\r\n\"2022-02-22

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we verify path in DataSourceAnalysis\r\n```\r\n// For dynamic partition overwrite, we do not delete partition directories ahead.\r\n// We write to staging directories and move to final partition directories after writing\r\n// job is done. So it is ok to have outputPath try to overwrite inputpath.\r\n if (overwrite && !insertCommand.dynamicPartitionOverwrite) {\r\n      DDLUtils.verifyNotReadPath(actualQuery, outputPath)\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n   * Throws exception if outputPath tries to overwrite inputpath.\r\n   */\r\n  def verifyNotReadPath(query: LogicalPlan, outputPath: Path) : Unit = {\r\n    val inputPaths = query.collect {\r\n      case LogicalRelation(r: HadoopFsRelation, _, _, _) =>\r\n        r.location.rootPaths\r\n    }.flatten\r\n\r\n    if (inputPaths.contains(outputPath)) {\r\n      throw new AnalysisException(\r\n        \"Cannot overwrite a path that is also being read from.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n````\r\n\r\nFor static partition insert and read data form same table, it's really a normal case. This bug troubles user a lot.\r\nIn this pr, for static partition insert, we can use same logical like dynamic partition overwrite to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport more ETL case\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAfter this patch, user can:\r\n\r\n1. Insert overwrite static partition from data read from same table's partition\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function `TIMESTAMPDIFF` with the following parameters:\r\n1. `unit` - sthis indicates the units of the difference between the given timestamps. Supported string values of `unit` are (case insensitive):\r\n   - YEAR\r\n   - QUARTER\r\n   - MONTH\r\n   - WEEK\r\n   - DAY\r\n   - HOUR\r\n   - MINUTE\r\n   - SECOND\r\n   - MILLISECOND\r\n   - MICROSECOND\r\n2. `timestampStart` - A timestamp which the expression subtracts from `timestampEnd`. Supported types are `timestamp` (`timestamp_ltz`).  The `timestamp_ntz` and `date` values are casted to `timestamp_ltz` implicitly at the session time zone (see the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`).\r\n3. `timestampEnd` - A timestamp from which the expression subtracts `timestampStart`.  Supported types are `timestamp` (`timestamp_ltz`). The `timestamp_ntz` and `date` values are casted to `timestamp_ltz` implicitly at the session time zone.\r\n\r\nThe function calculates the amount in terms of this unit, and returns a whole number, representing the number of complete units between the two timestamps. The type of the result is `LONG`. The result will be negative if the end is before the start timestamp.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> val df = sql(\"select timestampdiff(YEAR, timestamp'2010-02-16 01:02:03', timestamp'2022-02-16 01:02:03') as `diff in years`\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [diff in years: bigint]\r\n\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- diff in years: long (nullable = false)\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> df.show(false)\r\n+-------------+\r\n|diff in years|\r\n+-------------+\r\n|12           |\r\n+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier.\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other DBMSs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This is new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

is no Order specified, we add the Partition expressions as\r\n     * Order expressions. This is an implementation artifact. For UDAFS that\r\n     * imply order (like rank, dense_rank) depend on the Order Expressions to\r\n     * work. Internally we pass the Order Expressions as Args to these functions.\r\n     * We could change the translation so that the Functions are setup with\r\n     * Partition expressions when the OrderSpec is null; but for now we are setting up\r\n     * an OrderSpec that copies the Partition expressions.\r\n     */\r\n    protected void ensureOrderSpec(WindowFunctionSpec wFn) throws SemanticException {\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA query example：\r\n\r\n` sql(”SELECT a, b, Rank(b) OVER (PARTITION BY a) FROM  VALUES ('A1', 2), ('A1', 1), ('A2', 3), ('A1', 1) as tbl(a,b)\").show`\r\n\r\nbefore ：\r\n\r\n```log\r\nWindow function rank(b#12) requires window to be ordered, please add ORDER BY clause.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the assertion of data type against joining keys on stream-stream join to ignore nullability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing requirement on checking data types of joining keys is too restricted, as it also requires the same nullability. In batch query (I checked with HashJoinExec), nullability is ignored when checking data types of joining keys.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, end users will no longer encounter the assertion error on join keys with different nullability in both keys.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test added.","created_at":"2022-02-21T11:35:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T18:32:38Z","closed_at":"2022-02-22T06:58:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63eb65e97d7e07730df0e0167f42bfefd6581409","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent Spark SQL CLI alway use  shutdown hook to stop SparkSQLEnv\r\n```\r\n // Clean up after we exit\r\n    ShutdownHookManager.addShutdownHook { () => SparkSQLEnv.stop() }\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut use process ret to close client side jvm\r\n```\r\nwhile (line != null) {\r\n  if (!line.startsWith(\"--\")) {\r\n    if (prefix.nonEmpty) {\r\n      prefix += '\\n'\r\n     } \r\n    if (line.trim().endsWith(\";\") && !line.trim().endsWith(\"\\\\;\")) {\r\n      line = prefix + line\r\n      ret = cli.processLine(line, true)\r\n      prefix = \"\"\r\n      currentPrompt = promptWithCurrentDB\r\n    } else {\r\n      prefix = prefix + line\r\n      currentPrompt = continuedPromptWithDBSpaces\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  line = reader.readLine(currentPrompt + \"> \")\r\n}\r\n\r\nsessionState.close()\r\n\r\nSystem.exit(ret)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (sessionState.execString != null) {\r\n      exitCode = cli.processLine(sessionState.execString)\r\n      System.exit(exitCode)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      if (sessionState.fileName != null) {\r\n        exitCode = cli.processFile(sessionState.fileName)\r\n        System.exit(exitCode)\r\n      }\r\n    } catch {\r\n      case e: FileNotFoundException =>\r\n        logError(s\"Could not open input file for reading. (${e.getMessage})\")\r\n        exitCode = 3\r\n        System.exit(exitCode)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis always cause client side exit code not consistent with AM.\r\n\r\nIN this pr I prefer to pass the exit code to `SparkContext.stop()` method to pass a clear client side status to AM side in client mode. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I add a new `stop` method in `SchedulerBackend`\r\n```\r\ndef stop(exitCode: Int): Unit = stop()\r\n```\r\nSo we don't need to implement it for all kinds of scheduler backend.\r\nIn this pr, we only handle the case me meet for `YarnClientSchedulerBackend`, then we can only implement `stop(exitCode: Int)` for this class, then for yarn client mode, it can work now.\r\n\r\nI think this can benefit many similar case in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKeep client side status consistent  with AM side\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWith this pr, client side status will be same with am side\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMT\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-21T08:32:13Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T07:25:54Z","closed_at":"2022-11-01T07:25:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ce8aafb512f2048b0222be1f4c92af89602f502","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28527, we change to create table under the database location when the table location is relative. However the criteria to determine if a table location is relative/absolute is `URI.isAbsolute`, which basically checks if the table location URI has a scheme defined. So table URIs like `/table/path` are treated as relative and the scheme and authority of the database location URI are used to create the table. For example, when the database location URI is `s3a://bucket/db`, the table will be created at `s3a://bucket/table/path`, while it should be created under the file system defined in `SessionCatalog.hadoopConf` instead.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that by treating table location as absolute when the first letter of its path is slash.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to alter table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to fix the behavior described above. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. When users try to create/alter a table with a location that starts with a slash but without a scheme defined, the table will be created under/altered to the file system defined in `SessionCatalog.hadoopConf`, instead of the one defined in the database location URI.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nHide the \"failOnError\" field in the toString method of Abs/CheckOverflow. Here are two examples:\r\n* Abs.toString: `abs(-1, true)` => `abs(-1)`\r\n* CheckOverflow.toString: `CheckOverflow(0.12, DecimalType(5, 3), true)` => `CheckOverflow(0.12, DecimalType(5, 3))`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter changes, over 200 test failures of *PlanStabilitySuite are fixed with ANSI mode on. This is important for setting up testing job for ANSI mode. \r\nAlso, having the \"failOnError\" field in the string output of Abs, e.g.  `abs(-1, true)`, is quite odd.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but quite minor, hiding the \"failOnError\" field in the toString method of Abs/CheckOverflow\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual turn on ANSI mode and test all the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[SPARK-1189](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33/files)  introduces maven dependence on `commons-net`, and `org.apache.commons.net.util.Base64` is used in `SparkSaslServer`,  but `SparkSaslServer` has changed to use `io.netty.handler.codec.base64.Base64` and there is no explicit dependency on `commons-net` in Spark code, so this pr removed this dependency.\r\n\r\nAfter this pr Spark with `hadoop-3` profile no longer need `commons-net`, but Spark with `hadoop-2` still need it due to `hadoop-2.7.4` use `commons-net` directly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRemove unnecessary maven dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`commons-net` jar no longer exists in Spark-Client with

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to allow`ClusteredDistribution` (such as operator with window, aggregate, etc) to require full clustering keys. Traditionally operator with `ClusteredDistribution` can be satisfied with `HashPartitioning` on subset of clustering keys. This behavior could potentially lead to data skewness (comments raised from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35552). Although we have various way to deal with the data skewness in this case, such as adding `repartition()`, disabling bucketing, adding custom AQE rule etc. There's still case we cannot handle e.g. data skewness in the same stage - (`join(t1.x = t2.x)` followed by `window(t1.x, t1.y)`). With the newly introduced config `spark.sql.requireAllClusterKeysForDistribution`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to work around data skewness issue when partitioned on subset of keys.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the added config, but disable by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite.scala` and

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen parsing JSON unquoted `NaN` and `Infinity`values for floating-point columns we get the expected behavior as shown below where valid values are returned when the parsing option `allowNonNumericNumbers` is enabled and `null` otherwise.\r\n\r\n| Value     | allowNonNumericNumbers=true | allowNonNumericNumbers=false |\r\n| --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\r\n| NaN       | Double.NaN                  | null                         |\r\n| +INF      | Double.PositiveInfinity     | null                         |\r\n| +Infinity | Double.PositiveInfinity     | null                         |\r\n| Infinity  | Double.PositiveInfinity     | null                         |\r\n| -INF      | Double.NegativeInfinity     | null                         |\r\n| -Infinity | Double.NegativeInfinity     | null                         |\r\n\r\nHowever, when these values are quoted we get the following unexpected behavior due to a different code path being used that is inconsistent with Jackson's parsing and that ignores the `allowNonNumericNumbers` parser option.\r\n\r\n| Value       | allowNonNumericNumbers=true | allowNonNumericNumbers=false |\r\n| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\r\n| \"NaN\"       | Double.NaN                  | Double.NaN                   |\r\n| \"+INF\"      | null                        | null                         |\r\n| \"+Infinity\" | null                        | null                         |\r\n| \"Infinity\"  | Double.PositiveInfinity     | Double.PositiveInfinity      |\r\n| \"-INF\"      | null                        | null                         |\r\n| \"-Infinity\" | Double.NegativeInfinity     | Double.NegativeInfinity      |\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code path that handles quoted non-numeric numbers to make it consistent with the path that handles the unquoted values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior does not match the documented behavior in https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-json.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, parsing of quoted `NaN` and `Infinity` values will now be consistent with the unquoted versions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests are updated.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-18T23:13:54Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T14:43:00Z","closed_at":"2022-02-22T14:43:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09926cad5fb51c4726fec48fef02c709e2fc3508","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f8e8082a9855c7ba7a7c003487abbf369aea688","head":{"label":"andygrove:SPARK-38060","ref":"SPARK-38060","sha":"8f8e8082a9855c7ba7a7c003487abbf369aea688","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPer [feedback](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35561#issuecomment-1043663966) on #35561 from @dongjoon-hyun, I'm back porting fixes from `master` to `branch-3.2` since there was a conflict. From original PR:\r\n\r\n> Several `<code>` elements in running-on-kubernetes.md had typos in their closing tags, causing rendering issues on the HTML site. Example of rendering issue:\r\n> \r\n> https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/running-on-kubernetes.html#configuration\r\n>\r\n> This PR fixes those typos and resolves the rendering issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nChanges from #35561 were in conflict with `branch-3.2`. From original PR:\r\n\r\n> The typo fixes allows the HTML site to render the article correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFrom original PR: \r\n\r\n> Yes, currently the site shows several headers and closing tags as plain text:\r\n> https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/running-on-kubernetes.html#configuration\r\n> \r\n> This PR allows those headers to be correctly rendered and no longer shows the table's closing tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests were added. I did a local build of the site per the instructions and confirmed the HTML renders correctly.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-18T16:52:03Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T20:04:41Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T19:14:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51b5ed5398d7f3bdeb8bfee1ee630a747deeca91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3cfa7cf3edc8f072d07173ce110670c128001d42","head":{"label":"zr-msft:backport-pr-35561","ref":"backport-pr-35561","sha":"3cfa7cf3edc8f072d07173ce110670c128001d42","user":{"login":"zr-msft","id":43684271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjg0Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43684271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":458319379,"node_id":"R_kgDOG1FmEw","name":"spark","full_name":"zr-msft/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zr-msft","id":43684271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjg0Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43684271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange Cast.toString as \"cast\" instead of \"ansi_cast\" under ANSI mode.\r\nThis is to restore the behavior before https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27608\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. There is no such a function \"ansi_cast\" in Spark SQL\r\n2. Add/Divide/.. has different behavior under ANSI mode as well, but they don't have this special string representation.\r\n3. As we are setting up new Github job for ANSI mode, this can avoid test failures from TPCDS plan stability test suites \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but quite minor, the string output of `Cast` under ANSI mode becomes \"cast\" instead of \"ansi_cast\" again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `commitJob` and `abortJob` of HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol, the stagingDir was deleted, but for cases like the following example, the stagingDir was not created in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf the underLayer FileSystem is HDFS, there won't be any logs, but deleting a nonexistent file with FileSystem.delete would also acquire the WRITE LOCK of NameNode, if such operations are frequent, it would hurt the performance of NN.\r\nFor other FileSystem, like Alluxio, a warning log was thrown as follows.\r\n\r\nAbstractFileSystem: delete failed: alluxio.exception.FileDoesNotExistException: Path \"/test/spark/t10/.spark-staging-3cfe0d7c-3749-44de-9da7-f811a40aa4af\" does not exist. This ticket is to add an existence check before the actual deleting operation, which could help eliminate the WARN log or not hurt HDFS' performance.\r\n\r\nJIRA ticket:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are 5 api related to `java.io.Serializable` interface:\r\n\r\n- private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException\r\n- private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;\r\n- private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;\r\n- ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;\r\n- ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;\r\n\r\nAnd the implementations of these methods is mistaken for unused in Spark code, for example Intellij identify them as `Declaration is never used` and in we enabled the compilation options related to `unused`, there will also be relevant compilation warning log.\r\n\r\nSo this pr add `@nowarn` for this method to suppress related warnings, the added rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n- If it has one instance in a file, it uses it without importing (@scala.annotation.nowarn)\r\n- If it has more than one instances, it imports\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSuppress unwanted warnings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.*\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSeveral `<code>` elements in `running-on-kubernetes.md` had typos in their closing tags, causing rendering issues on the HTML site. Example of rendering issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/running-on-kubernetes.html#configuration\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes those typos and resolves the rendering issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe typo fixes allows the HTML site to render the article correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, currently the site shows several headers and closing tags as plain text:\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/running-on-kubernetes.html#configuration\r\n\r\nThis PR allows those headers to be correctly rendered and no longer shows the table's closing tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests were added. I did a local build of the site per the instructions and confirmed the HTML renders correctly.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T23:21:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-07T19:15:21Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T00:09:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76c283249944b4db261f5b1409faccd90bd7454c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4e18e501c101d12564d8794b21501c62deeb1b2","head":{"label":"zr-msft:fix-doc-running-on-kubernetes","ref":"fix-doc-running-on-kubernetes","sha":"d4e18e501c101d12564d8794b21501c62deeb1b2","user":{"login":"zr-msft","id":43684271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjg0Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43684271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":458319379,"node_id":"R_kgDOG1FmEw","name":"spark","full_name":"zr-msft/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zr-msft","id":43684271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjg0Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43684271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zr-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zr-msft/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncreasing the shuffle index weight with a constant number to avoid underestimating retained memory size caused by the bookkeeping objects: the `java.io.File` (depending on the path ~ 960 bytes) object and the `ShuffleIndexInformation` object (~180 bytes).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnderestimating cache entry size easily can cause OOM in the Yarn NodeManager. \r\nIn the following analyses of a prod issue (HPROF file) we can see the leak suspect Guava's `LocalCache$Segment` objects:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"943\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-02-17 at 18 55 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154541995-44014212-2046-41d6-ba7f-99369ca7d739.png\">\r\n\r\nGoing further we can see a `ShuffleIndexInformation` for a small index file (16 bytes) but the retained heap memory is 1192 bytes:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1351\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154645212-e0318d0f-cefa-4ae3-8a3b-97d2b506757d.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally we can see this is very common within this heap dump (using MAT's Object Query Language):\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2017933/154547678-44c8af34-1765-4e14-b71a-dc03d1a304aa.png\">\r\n\r\nI have even exported the data to a CSV and done some calculations with `awk`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tail -n+2 export.csv | awk -F, 'BEGIN { numUnderEstimated=0; } { sumOldSize += $1; corrected=$1 + 1176; sumCorrectedSize += corrected; sumRetainedMem += $2; if (corrected < $2) numUnderEstimated+=1; } END { print \"sum old size: \" sumOldSize / 1024 / 1024   \" MB, sum corrected size: \" sumCorrectedSize / 1024 / 1024 \" MB, sum retained memory:\" sumRetainedMem / 1024 / 1024  \" MB, num under estimated: \" numUnderEstimated }'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives the followings:\r\n```\r\nsum old size: 76.8785 MB, sum corrected size: 1066.93 MB, sum retained memory:1064.47 MB, num under estimated: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo using the old calculation we were at 7.6.8 MB way under the default cache limit (100 MB). \r\nUsing the correction (applying 1176 as increment to the size) we are at 1066.93 MB (~1GB) which is close to the real retained sum heap: 1064.47 MB (~1GB) and there is no entry which was underestimated.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further and get rid of `java.io.File` completely and store the `ShuffleIndexInformation` for the file path.\r\nThis way not only the cache size estimate is improved but the its size is decreased as well. \r\nHere the path size is not counted into the cache size as that string is interned. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith the calculations above.","created_at":"2022-02-17T18:45:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T19:34:08Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T19:32:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"370e2236f0aaec91b8778631146439bfe2e5d4de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/edad34336ae63f318a599ccbc55b875c96d721c7","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-33206","ref":"SPARK-33206","sha":"edad34336ae63f318a599ccbc55b875c96d721c7","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new config `spark.sql.aggregate.requireAllClusterKeys` (default: false) to force required child distribution of Aggregate to use `HashClusteredDistribution` instead of `ClusteredDistribution`, which effectively requires all cluster keys on output partitioning.\r\n(Technically it requires more strict condition, but this PR takes the easier and less invasive way to implement since it's only effective when the config is enabled.)\r\n\r\nThis PR also proposes to rename back `StatefulOpClusteredDistribution` to `HashClusteredDistribution`, since it is now being used from batch query as well. This PR retains the content of the classdoc for stateful operators in `HashClusteredDistribution`, along with new general content of the classdoc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe figured out performance issues with aggregate operator in some cases. To explain a simple case, suppose table t1 is hash partitioned by k1, with a small number of partitions and the data is skewed. If we run GROUP BY k1, k2 against the table, Spark doesn't add a shuffle (intended in point of Spark's view) and the query will run super slowly.\r\n\r\nWe observed the query slowness from mins to hours due to this, so we can't simply say it's a trade off. Since we don't have a good way to automatically deal with the issue, we would like to provide the config to end users to tune by theirselves at least.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will have a new config to enforce requiring all grouping keys on output partitioning of the child of aggregate.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2022-02-17T11:03:47Z","updated_at":"2022-02-20T03:20:11Z","closed_at":"2022-02-20T02:50:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da664b53dc0d7163a3dc52628f44ac071564d134","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename back `StatefulOpClusteredDistribution` to `HashClusteredDistribution`. This PR retains the content of the classdoc for stateful operators in `HashClusteredDistribution`, along with new general content of the classdoc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe figured out that in some case `HashClusteredDistribution` is still desirable other than stateful operators; `HashPartitioning` with subset of grouping keys can satisfy `ClusteredDistribution`, which means the cardinality of the subset of grouping keys technically defines the max parallelism. Increasing the number of partitions does not always help to solve the skew of the partitions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests since this PR just renames a class.","created_at":"2022-02-17T11:00:54Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T07:12:41Z","closed_at":"2022-02-17T11:02:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce3bfd8788f24e435961c24eb933d8374f5aa40a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTry to optimize the string contains join query which could run for a long time. \r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a.text, b.pattern\r\nFROM fact_table a\r\nJOIN patterns b\r\nON a.text like concat('%', b.pattern, '%');\r\n```\r\nOr\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a.text, b.pattern\r\nFROM fact_table a\r\nJOIN patterns b\r\nON position(b.pattern, a.text) > 0;\r\n```\r\nThe query will go from **O(M * N * m * n)** to **O(M * m * max(n))**\r\nM = number of records in the fact table\r\nN = number of records in the patterns table\r\nm = row length of the fact table\r\nn = row length of the patterns table\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this change, if we want to match many patterns  for each row of the fact table, it could run a very long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a spark conf in order to just fetch partitions' name instead of fetching partitions' details. This can reduce requests on hive metastore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. method `listPartitions` is order to get locations of partitions and compute custom partition locations(variable `customPartitionLocations`), but in most cases we do not have custom partition locations.\r\n2. method `listPartitionNames` just fetchs partitions' name, it can reduce requests on hive metastore db.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, we should config \"spark.sql.hasCustomPartitionLocations = false\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. recompile InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand.scala\r\n2. update spark-sql_2.12-3.0.2.jar\r\n3. run insert into cases\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T08:58:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:55Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f2d732c73310ed6ed306188d66b278bc667f27a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f7c09ef0acae6a187f3150ae46087b4479719d9","head":{"label":"coalchan:parts","ref":"parts","sha":"0f7c09ef0acae6a187f3150ae46087b4479719d9","user":{"login":"coalchan","id":6671051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzEwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6671051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan","html_url":"https://github.com/coalchan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":459908033,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2mjwQ","name":"spark","full_name":"coalchan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"coalchan","id":6671051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzEwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6671051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan","html_url":"https://github.com/coalchan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coalchan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/coalchan/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd two monitoring REST API endpoints under SQL that provides details about the structured streaming queries. Even though a store exists for it and the data is presented in the UI under the \"Structured Streaming\" tab, this data is not exposed as a REST API. \r\n\r\n#### Summary API\r\nReturns the summary of all existing streaming queries.\r\n\r\nGET `/{appId}/sql/streamingqueries`\r\n\r\nResponse is list of `StreamingQueryData`.\r\n\r\n#### Progress API\r\nReturns the progress events of a specific streaming query by `runId`. User can also specify how many of the most recent events needs to be retrieved by using the `last `query parameter. By default, we return the most recent progress event i.e. last is set to 1.\r\n\r\nGET `/{appId}/sql/streamingqueries/{runId}/progress?last={N}`\r\n\r\nResponse is list of `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\nNote: We are not introducing new object definitions for the response since we are just returning the data from the store without aggregation, these are existing event structures - `StreamingQueryData` and `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis data can be used for monitoring, detecting streaming and to build custom dashboards. This monitoring API will be similar to the monitoring APIs that are present for DStreams - refer [SPARK-18470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18470).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Added 4 tests under `SqlResourceWithActualMetricsSuite` to test the endpoints when streaming code is executed. Tested various cases, parameters, boundary conditions\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298735/154372194-20945ddd-14ab-4ac5-894c-bc21f1c0aae4.png)\r\n\r\n* Added 2 tests under `SqlResourceInvalidEndpointSuite.scala` to test the endpoints when no streaming code is running.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298735/154372293-94c2108c-4907-4838-83dd-f79c45ad03e5.png)\r\n\r\n* As mentioned earlier, since we are just returning the objects from the store, there is no need to test them individually.","created_at":"2022-02-17T00:32:04Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:56Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc4a6a20b687b6cfed749426cd8f126ec5406839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
