PR attempts to fix BEAM-5633 (Python SDK harness logging client failure) by adding reconnect logic to the logging client. With this patch, we haven't seen logging failures on our infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis issue manifests itself on the server (taskmanager) side with the exception\r\n\r\n```\r\n[grpc-default-executor-0] WARN org.apache.beam.runners.fnexecution.logging.GrpcLoggingService - Logging client failed unexpectedly.\r\norg.apache.beam.vendor.grpc.v1.io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: CANCELLED: cancelled before receiving half close\r\n\tat org.apache.beam.vendor.grpc.v1.io.grpc.Status.asRuntimeException(Status.java:517)\r\n\tat org.apache.beam.vendor.grpc.v1.io.grpc.stub.ServerCalls$StreamingServerCallHandler$StreamingServerCallListener.onCancel(ServerCalls.java:272)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand on the client (python worker) side with\r\n\r\n```\r\nE1004 22:08:02.139750634      38 chttp2_transport.cc:1097]   Received a GOAWAY with error code ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM and debug data equal to \"too_many_pings\"\r\nException in thread read_log_control_messages:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 801, in __bootstrap_inner\r\n    self.run()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 754, in run\r\n    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/log_handler.py\", line 65, in <lambda>\r\n    target=lambda: self._read_log_control_messages(log_control_messages),\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/log_handler.py\", line 111, in _read_log_control_messages\r\n    for _ in log_control_iterator:\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grpc/_channel.py\", line 350, in next\r\n    return self._next()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grpc/_channel.py\", line 341, in _next\r\n    raise self\r\n_Rendezvous: <_Rendezvous of RPC that terminated with (StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE, Socket closed)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, the issue is the client is sending the server too many illegal pings, and the server eventually closes the connection. As the client doesn't have any retry logic it never recovers from this.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there'd be two levels of fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Update the server or client gRPC configuration to prevent the client from sending bad pings or to prevent the server from killing the connection in this situation (see [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/keepalive.md) for more documentation of this behavior)\r\n2. Make the logging client more robust, reconnecting when the connection is lost\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find a configuration that solves the first part, so that may need more investigation. Regardless, I think it's worthwhile having reconnection logic even if that issue is fixed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is part of a series of PRs with the goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\nFixing the tests for Python 3 requires a lot of cross-package fixes. I'm therefore submitting this PR with the failing tests skipped during Python 3 testing. This will allow us to build on these fixes while porting the other packages. Since the remaining errors might be caused by other packages, porting of these packages might already solve some of these errors.\r\n\r\nIn a later stage, these errors should be un-skipped and fixed if they are still failing.\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @aaltay\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

commit adds the test with all neecssary setup required to run itmanually. \r\n\r\nThe following GroupByKey load test can be run on all runners using the following command (example is for flink):\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew run -p sdks/java/load-tests -PloadTest.args='--fanout=5 --iterations=1 --sourceOptions={\"numRecords\":1000,\"splitPointFrequencyRecords\":1,\"keySizeBytes\":10,\"valueSizeBytes\":20,\"numHotKeys\":3,\"hotKeyFraction\":0.3,\"seed\":123456,\"bundleSizeDistribution\":{\"type\":\"const\",\"const\":42},\"forceNumInitialBundles\":100,\"progressShape\":\"LINEAR\",\"initializeDelayDistribution\":{\"type\":\"const\",\"const\":42}} --stepOptions={\"outputRecordsPerInputRecord\":2,\"preservesInputKeyDistribution\":2,\"keySizeBytes\":10,\"valueSizeBytes\":20,\"numHotKeys\":3,\"hotKeyFraction\":0.3,\"seed\":123456}} --runner=FlinkRunner' -Prunner=\":beam-runners-flink_2.11\" -PloadTest.mainClass=\"org.apache.beam.sdk.loadtests.GroupByKeyLoadTest\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunner can be changed by altering the runner-related properties. We can also add `--flinkMaster=localhost:8081` to run this on a separate flink cluster (not in memory).\r\n\r\nYou can skip the syntieticStep pipeline option. Example for dataflow runner:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew run -p sdks/java/load-tests -PloadTest.args='--fanout=5 --iterations=1 --sourceOptions={\"numRecords\":1000,\"splitPointFrequencyRecords\":1,\"keySizeBytes\":10,\"valueSizeBytes\":20,\"numHotKeys\":3,\"hotKeyFraction\":0.3,\"seed\":123456,\"bundleSizeDistribution\":{\"type\":\"const\",\"const\":42},\"forceNumInitialBundles\":100,\"progressShape\":\"LINEAR\",\"initializeDelayDistribution\":{\"type\":\"const\",\"const\":42}} --runner=DataflowRunner' -Prunner=\":beam-runners-google-cloud-dataflow-java\" -PloadTest.mainClass=\"org.apache.beam.loadtests.GroupByKeyLoadTest\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n@pabloem could you take a look? I know there is a separate PR for this but it was easier to completely rebuild the pr due to the fact that now it does not require Perfkit and runs from the main code. I didn't develop any method of publishing the metrics to BigQuery - this needs a follow up pull request (is it ok?).\r\n\r\nCC: @echauchot\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Runner-specific pipeline options were previously ignored. Runner Pipeline options had\r\nto be replicated in the Python SDK to be passed on to the Runner.\r\n\r\nValidating known options in the SDK is a good way to report failures back to the\r\nuser early. However, it also requires to maintain options in multiple places.\r\n\r\nThis change passes on unknown options as long as they are in the form of\r\n'--option value' or '--option=value'. It logs whenever that happens. All other\r\noptions are discarded, as previously the case. Discarding option is now logged\r\nwith a warn.

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\nFixing the tests for Python 3 requires a lot of cross-package fixes. I'm therefore submitting this PR with the failing tests skipped during Python 3 testing. This will allow us to build on these fixes while porting the other packages. Since the remaining errors might be caused by other packages, porting of these packages might already solve some of these errors.\r\n\r\nIn a later stage, these errors should be un-skipped and fixed if they are still failing.\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @charlesccychen @aaltay \r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Some examples that will be useful:\r\n\r\nDownsampling time series based on simple AVG, MIN, MAX\r\nCreating a value for each time window using generatesequence as a seed\r\nLoading the value of a downsample with the previous value (used in FX with previous close being brought into current open value)\r\n\r\nThis will show some concrete examples of keyed state as well as the use of combiners. \r\nThe samples can also be used to show how you can create a ordered list of values per key from a unbounded topic which has multiple time series keys.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR proposes some additions to `MapElements` to natively support a pattern in use by the community of handling expected failures of a mapping step by emitting success and failure collections wrapped together in a PCollectionTuple. In particular, see @vllry's blog post [Error Handling Elements in Apache Beam Pipelines](https://medium.com/@vallerylancey/error-handling-elements-in-apache-beam-pipelines-fffdea91af2a).\r\n\r\nWe also add exception handling to AsJsons and ParseJsons here to demonstrate how the new `MapElements` methods can be used. Looking for feedback at this point on whether it's worth continuing to pursue this direction. If it looks compelling, this PR will evolve to include tests and we can discuss specifics of the interface, method naming, and documentation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-28T17:01:59Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T17:09:33Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T17:09:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d2c133ff94411e4244dc280f330d945548c18c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/6518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/6518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/6518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/6a1052b9acbe16c9e2d0c934188287be2510f04f","head":{"label":"jklukas:json-witherrors","ref":"json-witherrors","sha":"6a1052b9acbe16c9e2d0c934188287be2510f04f","user":{"login":"jklukas","id":691060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/691060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas","html_url":"https://github.com/jklukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149124024,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxMjQwMjQ=","name":"beam","full_name":"jklukas/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jklukas","id":691060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/691060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas","html_url":"https://github.com/jklukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jklukas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jklukas/beam","description":"Apache
