support for \"adopt orphaned tasks\" to the ECS Executor.  \r\n\r\nA task can become orphaned, for example, when the scheduler container is re-deployed or terminated or other cases where the SchedulerJob got interrupted.  `try_adopt_task_instances` is defined in the BaseExecutor (this PR implements it in the ECS Executor) and is called by the Scheduler [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job_runner.py#L1667).\r\n\r\nBased heavily on the [work here](https://github.com/aelzeiny/airflow-aws-executors/pull/15) by

In case of an `airflow-scheduler` running in a docker container with the `--restart always` option set, the exit code 0 will make the container stop and not restart because docker will interpret it as the code ran and finished with success. So if you have a DB quick unavailability, the `airflow-scheduler` will not try to recover by restarting it and it will stop, causing the airflow instance to crash (without the scheduler).\r\n\r\nSo, this PR is raising the exception and forcing the process in context to terminate (closing the contexts in `stack` on `finally` to keep avoiding the zombie scheduler https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32706) and avoid the scheduler exiting with code 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

I am newcomer here\r\n\r\nDid tried to follow getting started guide and on very first step where you asking to create `AIRFLOW_HOME` environment variable, my thinking was - I do not want to mess my home directory, and instead will do something like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport AIRFLOW_HOME=./airflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nand exactly because of that, on a next steps I received an \"strange\" error:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) unable to open database file\r\n```\r\n\r\nI bed, I am not a first one and not last one who struggled with

source code and package generation was done using the code generated and committed to `airflow-client-python` and while the repository with such code is useful to have, it's just a convenience repo, because all sources are (and should be) generated from the API specification which is present in the Airflow repository.\r\n\r\nThis also made the reproducible builds and package generation not really possible, because we never knew if the source generated in the `airflow-client-python` repository has been generated and not tampered with.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing it, it turned out that there were some issues in the past that nade our client generation somewhat broken..\r\n\r\n* In 2.7.0 python client, we added the same code twice (See https://github.com/apache/airflow-client-python/pull/93) on top of \"airflow_client.client\" package, we also added copy of the API client generated in \"airflow_client.airflow_client\" - that was likely due to bad bash scripts and tools that were used to generate it and errors during generation the clients.\r\n\r\n* We used to generate the code for \"client\" package and then moved the \"client\" package to \"airflow_client.client\" package, while manually modifying imports with `sed` (!?). That was likely due to limitations in some old version of the client generator. However the client generator we use now is capable of generating code directly in the \"airflow_client.client\" package.\r\n\r\n* We also manually (via pre-commit) added Apache Licence to the generated files. Whieh was completely unnecessary, because ASF rules do not require licence headers to be added to code automatically generated from a code that already has ASF licence.\r\n\r\n* We also generated source tarball packages from such generated code, which was completely unnecessary - because sdist packages are already fulfilling all the reqirements of such source pacakges - the code in the packages is enough to build the package from the sources and it does not contain any binary code, moreover the code is generated out of the API specificiation, which means that anyone can take the code and genearate the pacakged software from just sources in sdist. Similarly as in case of provider packages, we do not need to produce separate -source.tar.gz files.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all of it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the source that lands in the source repository `airflow-client-python` and sdist/wheel packages are generated directly from the openapi specification.\r\n\r\nThey are generated using breeze release_management command from airflow source  tagged with specific tag in the Airflow repo (including the source of reproducible build date that is updated together with airflow release notes. This means that any PMC member can regenerate packages (binary identical) straight from the Airflow repository - without going through \"airflow-client-python\" repository.\r\n\r\nNo source tarball is generated - it is not needed, sdist is enough.\r\n\r\nThe `test_python_client.py` has been also moved over to Airflow repo\r\nand updated with handling case when expose_config is not enabled and\r\nit is used to automatically test the API client after it has been\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36638 change introduced \"full package\" checks - where in case of CI we run mypy checks separately from regular static checks, for the whole folders.\r\n\r\nHowever it's been a little convoluted on how the checks were run, with a separate env variable. Instead we can actually have multiple mypy-* checks (same as we have for local pre-commit runs) as mypy allows to have multiple checks with the same name in various stages.\r\n\r\nThis change simplifies the setup a bit:\r\n\r\n* we name the checks \"folder\" checks because this is what they are\r\n* we name the check names consistent (\"airflow\", \"providers\", \"docs\", \"dev\") with mypy-folders output\r\n* we have separate small script to run the folder checks\r\n* we map \"providers\" into \"airflow/providers\" in the pre-commit\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the `trigger_run_id` parameter to avoid cases when a stringified integer value is provided as a run_id but its recast by either python or jinja (with `render_template_as_native_obj=True` and `Param` type set to `string`).\r\n\r\nFor example, if run id's are represented as integers, Airflow's run model uses varchar type, however python or jinja forces the run id into an integer causing this lookup

tarball is the main artifact produced by the release process - one that is the \"official\" release and named like that by the Apache Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the source tarball generation reproducible - following reproducibility of the `.whl` and `sdist` packages.\r\n\r\nThis change adds:\r\n\r\n* vendors-in reproducible.py script that repacks .tar.gz package in reproducible way using source-date-epoch as timestamps\r\n* breeze release-management prepare-airflow-tarball command\r\n* adds verification of the tarballs to PMC verification process\r\n* adds --use-local-hatch for package building command to allow for faster / non-docker build of packages for PMC verification\r\n* improves diagnostic output of the release and build commands\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the

has built-in support for reproducible builds, however it uses a hard-coded 2020 date to generate the reproducible binaries, which produces whl, tar.gz files that contain file dates that are pretty old. This might be confusing for anyone who is looking at the file contents and timestamp inside.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support (similar to provider approach) to store current reproducible date in the repository - so that it can be committed and tagged together with Airflow sources. It is updated fully automaticallly by pre-commit whenever release notes change, which basically means that whenever release notes are update just before release, the reproducible date is updated to current date.\r\n\r\nFor now we only check if the packages produced by hatchling build are reproducible.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

special timetable allows a DAG to be run against a time-based schedule and dataset events at the same time.

The two do not interact in any way.\r\n\r\nI aim to maybe refactor this a bit so a DAG can take more complex combinations (e.g. `dataset1 OR dataset2 OR timetable`), but this is the simplest thing for

#35650 introduced a hotfix for Pyarrow CVE-2023-47248. So far we have been blocked from removing it by Apache Beam that limited Airflow from bumping pyarrow to a version that was not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThis is now possible since Apache Beam relesed 2.53.0 version on 4th of January 2023 that allows to use non-vulnerable pyarrow.\r\n\r\nWe are now bumping both Pyarrow and Beam minimum versions to reflect that and remove pyarrow hotfix.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#35650 introduced a hotfix for Pyarrow CVE-2023-47248. So far we have been blocked from removing it by Apache Beam that limited Airflow from bumping pyarrow to a version that was not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThis is now possible since Apache Beam relesed 2.53.0 version on 4th of January 2023 that allows to use non-vulnerable pyarrow.\r\n\r\nWe are now bumping both Pyarrow and Beam minimum versions to reflect that and remove pyarrow hotfix.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

is a regular bump of Amazon-provider related dependencies. The way how botocore releases are done, they are putting a lot of strain on `pip` to resolve the right set of dependencies, including long backtracking, when there are too man versions available.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from time to time, we are bumping minimum version of Amazon-related dependencies to limit the impact frequent releases of boto and botocore has. Also it is generally fine to update min version of dependencies for providers because at the very least users can still use previously released providers in case they have problem with those dependencies, also many of the updated dependencies contain fixes and feature we implicitly depend on and bumping them regulary is a good way to make sure all the functionalities of the Amazon provider are working as expected.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the bump is that as of 1.33 version botocore and boto version stopped being shifted by 3 (previously boto3 1.28 was the version corresponding to botocore 1.31). As of version 1.33 this problem has been solved. See https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/2702\r\n\r\nWatchtower min version is bumped to version 3 (which is 12 months old even if before we opted for much older (more than 2 years old) and again if users want to use older version of watchtower, they can opt for previous provider version.\r\n\r\nThis change saves 5-6 minutes of backtracking when `pip` try to find the right version of dependencies when upgrading to newer version.\r\n\r\nExtracted from #36537\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
