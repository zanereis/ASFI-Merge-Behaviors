What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes bottum-up resolution in `ResolveFunctions`, which is much faster (requires less number of resolution rounds) if we have deeply nested `UnresolvedFunctions`. These structures are more likely to occur after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42864.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance optimization.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add a new optimizer rule `EliminateWindowPartitions`, it remove window partition if partition expressions are foldable.\r\nsql1:\r\n`select row_number() over(order by a) b from t `\r\nsql2:\r\n`select row_number() over(partition by 1 order by a) b from t `\r\nAfter this PR, the `optimizedPlan` for sql1 and sql2 is the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFoldable partition is redundant, remove it not only can simplify plan, but some rules can also take effect when the partitions are all foldable, such as `LimitPushDownThroughWindow`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to add a new test tag `SlowSQLTest` to the sql module, and identified some Suites with test cases more than 3 seconds, and apply it to GA testing task to reduce the testing pressure of the `sql others` group.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a long time, the sql module UTs has only two groups: `slow` and `others`. The test cases in group `slow` are fixed, while the number of test cases in group `others` continues to increase, which has had a certain impact on the testing duration and stability of group `others`. \r\n\r\nSo this PR proposes to add a new testing group to share the testing pressure of `sql others` group, which has made the testing time of the three groups more average, and hope it can improve the stability of the GA task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould monitor GA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`scala.language.higherKinds` is deprecated and no longer needs to be imported explicitly in Scala 2.13, so this PR removes the imports for scala.language.higherKinds and the corresponding compiler suppression rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn SPARK-43849(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41356), I added compiler suppression rules to allow `unused imports` checks to work with both Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13. As there is no longer a need to support Scala 2.12, we can now clean them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-09-26T12:16:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T04:27:18Z","closed_at":"2023-09-27T04:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2c83c453c955da3ae205f2d11467d30a8604491","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4410b28fbeea11803a620af97db20c83ba268cbe","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-43850","ref":"SPARK-43850","sha":"4410b28fbeea11803a620af97db20c83ba268cbe","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove Hive support prior to 2.0.0 (`spark.sql.hive.metastore.version`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe dropped JDK 8 and 11, and Hive prior to 2.0.0 cannot work together. They are actually already the dead code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTechnically no, because this wouldn't already work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNope because there is no way to test them.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-26T03:20:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:36Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T22:20:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"430248b31d461aeeccf8884e9518bda1fda3496f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49dab344ecf7e06ebb84368d71e3d51e25feeaf6","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-45328","ref":"SPARK-45328","sha":"49dab344ecf7e06ebb84368d71e3d51e25feeaf6","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when migrating a shuffle block during decommission, its location type would be changed from shuffle service (if enabled) to the executor. This is of course not the expected behavior. We should still use the external shuffle service to fetch the migrated shuffle blocks. This PR fixes this issue by respecting the shuffle service when reporting the shuffle blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade snappy from 1.1.10.3 to 1.1.10.4\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSecurity Fix\r\nFixed SnappyInputStream so as not to allocate too large memory when decompressing data with an extremely large chunk size by @​tunnelshade ([code change](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5))\r\nThis does not affect users only using Snappy.compress/uncompress methods\r\n\r\n[Release note](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/releases)\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nWhile performing mitigation efforts related to [CVE-2023-34455](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34455) in Confluent products, our Application Security team closely analyzed the fix that was accepted and merged into snappy-java version 1.1.10.1 in [this](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea) commit. The check on [line 421](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea#diff-c3e53610267092989965e8c7dd2d4417d355ff7f560f9e8075b365f32569079fR421) only attempts to check if chunkSize is not a negative value. We believe that this is an inadequate fix as it misses an upper-bounds check for overly positive values such as 0x7FFFFFFF (or (2,147,483,647 in decimal) before actually [attempting to allocate](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea#diff-c3e53610267092989965e8c7dd2d4417d355ff7f560f9e8075b365f32569079fR429) the provided unverified number of bytes via the “chunkSize” variable. This missing upper-bounds check can lead to the applications depending upon snappy-java to allocate an inappropriate number of bytes on the heap which can then cause an java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception. Under some specific conditions and contexts, this can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack with a direct impact on the availability of the dependent implementations based on the usage of the snappy-java library for compression/decompression needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to merge test cases from `SingletonRepl2Suite/Repl2Suite` back into `SingletonReplSuite/ReplSuite` to reduce duplicate code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28545 split the relevant test cases from `SingletonReplSuite/ReplSuite` into `SingletonRepl2Suite/Repl2Suite`, distinguishing different test versions of Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark 4.0 no longer supports Scala 2.12, so they can be merged back into the original files to reduce duplicate code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-09-25T14:19:55Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T03:59:31Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T03:02:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"445f2386c9cd27fee215eb308d76d3e10562d370","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

for Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark 4.0 no longer supports Scala 2.12, so the corresponding code simplification can be performed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new parameters `ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles` to `HadoopRDD` and `NewHadoopRDD`, and set it to the current value of:\r\n- `spark.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles` in Spark `core`,\r\n- `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles` when the rdds created in Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To make `HadoopRDD` and `NewHadoopRDD` consistent to other RDDs like `FileScanRDD` created by Spark SQL that take into account the SQL configs `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles`.\r\n2. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, so, users can control ignoring of missing files without re-creating spark context.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `HadoopRDD`/`NewHadoopRDD` invoked by SQL code such hive table scans respect the SQL configs `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles` and don't respect the core configs `spark.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`/`ignoreMissingFiles`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileBasedDataSourceSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enable `GroupbySplitApplyTests.test_split_apply_combine_on_series`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43002, this test is skipped since Pandas 2.0.0 upgrade, but the root cause of the test failure is classified as regression from Pandas. So we can manually make the test pass for now and will update the test when Pandas regression is resolved.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's test-only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo update the existing test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr makes `InMemoryColumnarBenchmark` inherit from AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper and use the `AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper#collect` function to collect plans, enabling `InMemoryColumnarBenchmark` to run successfully.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter SPARK-42768 merged, the default value of `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning` has changed from false to true, so `InMemoryColumnarBenchmark ` should use AQE-aware utils to collect plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn theory, we don't need https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29875 anymore because we dropped JDK 8 (according to the PR description in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29875) but `Utils.getSimpleClass` handles malformed class names in any event, so should be safe to keep them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo remove test that does not run. We dropped JDK 11/8 at SPARK-44112\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test them out.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-25T04:19:04Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:41Z","closed_at":"2023-09-25T17:08:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76fdf3c3fe1f62ea1557c7895dd0186902e79d1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc83c2f3d6bd422d88955d054d23ae996ecbcc1e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-45305","ref":"SPARK-45305","sha":"bc83c2f3d6bd422d88955d054d23ae996ecbcc1e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to migrate Junit 4 to Junit 5 jupiter api, the main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Change JUnit 4 related test dependencies to JUnit 5 to ensure Maven and SBT can run JUnit test normally: `junit` -> `junit-jupiter`, `com.github.sbt:junit-interface` -> `net.aichler:jupiter-interface`, `jmock-junit4` -> `jmock-junit5` and add `sbt-jupiter-interface` plugin to plugins.sbt\r\n2. API migration：\r\n2.1 Annotations reside in the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package\r\n2.2 `@Before` and `@After` no longer exist, use `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` instead\r\n2.3 `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` no longer exist, use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` instead\r\n2.4 `@Ignore` no longer exists, use `@Disabled` instead\r\n2.5 `Assertions` reside in `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` and the assertion api with error message has a little changes there are a few api changes, for example: `assertEquals(\"my message\", 1, 2)` -> `assertEquals(1, 2, \"my message\")`\r\n2.6 Assumptions reside in `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJUnit5 is a powerful and flexible update to the JUnit framework, and it provides a variety of improvements and new features to organize and describe test cases, as well as help in understanding test results：\r\n\r\n1. JUnit 5 leverages features from Java 8 or later, such as lambda functions, making tests more powerful and easier to maintain, but Junit 4 still a Java 7 compatible version\r\n2. JUnit 5 has added some useful new features for describing, organizing, and executing tests. For examples: [Parameterized Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests) and [Conditional Test Execution](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-conditions) may make our test code look simpler, [Parallel Execution](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution) may make our test faster\r\n\r\nMore importantly, Junit4 is currently an inactive project, which has not released a new version for more than two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore importantly, Junit4 is currently an inactive project, which has not released a new version for more than two years\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-09-24T16:54:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T13:27:49Z","closed_at":"2023-09-27T13:24:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"562b693ac9f5aac5e20f480a9404bd41b767ba5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update K8s doc to recommend K8s 1.26+ for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**1. Default K8s Version in Public Cloud environments**\r\n\r\nThe default K8s versions of public cloud providers are already K8s 1.27+.\r\n\r\n- EKS: v1.27 (Default)\r\n- GKE: v1.27 (Stable), v1.27 (Regular), v1.27 (Rapid)\r\n\r\n**2. End Of Support**\r\n\r\nIn addition, K8s 1.25 and olders are going to reach EOL when Apache Spark 4.0.0 arrives on June 2024. K8s 1.26 is also going to reach EOL on June.\r\n\r\n| K8s  |   AKS   |   GKE   |   EKS   |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| 1.27 | 2024-07 | 2024-08 | 2024-07 |\r\n| 1.26 | 2024-03 |

documentation-only change about K8s versions.\r\n- Apache Spark K8s Integration Test is currently using K8s v1.26.3 on Minikube already.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-23T03:04:05Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T03:49:26Z","closed_at":"2023-09-23T03:49:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8046ed49b66e325046b1594a05a05d3c79ee1be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c8368521b238b75b465fe9b6947ef3de5ef6d967","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-44119","ref":"SPARK-44119","sha":"c8368521b238b75b465fe9b6947ef3de5ef6d967","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnables the correctness fixes for `null IN (empty list)` expressions by default when ANSI is enabled. Under non-ANSI the old behavior remains the default for now. After soaking for some time under ANSI, we should switch the new behavior to default in both cases.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, `null IN (empty list)` incorrectly evaluated to null, when it should evaluate to false. (The reason it should be false is because a IN (b1, b2) is defined as a = b1 OR a = b2, and an empty IN list is treated as an empty OR which is false. This is specified by ANSI SQL.)\r\n\r\nMany places in Spark execution (In, InSet, InSubquery) and optimization (OptimizeIn, NullPropagation) implemented this wrong behavior. This is a longstanding correctness issue which has existed since null support for IN expressions was first added to Spark.\r\n\r\nSee previous PRs where the fixes were implemented:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupporting Hive 4.0 metastore where partition filters even for CHAR and a VARCHAR types can be pushed down.\r\n\r\n**Hive 4.0 is still beta! This is why this is a work on progress PR.** \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupporting more Hive versions (with extra performance improvement) is good for our users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Regarding supporting Hive 4.0 metastore the documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Manually\r\n\r\nI used the docker image of apache/hive:4.0.0-beta-1 for starting a metastore and a hiveserver2 (along with a hadoop3 docker image).\r\n\r\nCreated a table:\r\n```\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE testTable1 ( \r\n  column1 String \r\n) PARTITIONED BY (partColumn1 CHAR(30), partColumn2 VARCHAR(30)) LOCATION 'hdfs://hadoop3:8020/tmp/hive_external/';\r\n```\r\n\r\nInserted some values in beeline:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninsert into table testtable1 values (\"column1_v1\", \"partcolumn1_v1\", \"partcolumn2_v1\"), (\"column1_v2\", \"partcolumn1_v2\", \"partcolumn2_v2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarted my spark in the hiveserver2 container as:\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.version=4.0.0 --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=\"/opt/hive/lib/*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the query as:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from testtable1 where partcolumn1 = 'partcolumn1_v1' and partcolumn2 = 'partcolumn2_v1'\").show\r\nHive Session ID = 6846fe0e-968a-474d-afec-4f67b3a2a274\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n|   column1|         partcolumn1|   partcolumn2|\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n|column1_v1|partcolumn1_v1   ...|partcolumn2_v1|\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check the HMS calls in the metastore container in the file `/tmp/hive/hive.log`:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n2023-09-22T21:06:34,293  INFO [Metastore-Handler-Pool: Thread-1356] HiveMetaStore.audit: ugi=hive       ip=172.30.0.5   cmd=source:172.30.0.5 get_partitions_by_filter : tbl=hive.default.testtable1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich contains the expected `get_partitions_by_filter`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport for LIMIT in correlated lateral and scalar subqueries was added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42705. However, that PR also extended Analyzer support for limit/order by in EXISTS/IN subqueries, for which we don't have good planning support yet. \r\nThis PR introduces checks that ensure correlated IN/EXISTS subqueries do not have LIMIT clauses.\r\nWe do not add a new type of QueryCompilationError, as we plan to fully support such subqueries in the next couple of months, so for now we re-use the same analysis error as used to be issued before https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42705.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use a forked [repo](https://github.com/yaooqinn/dagre-d3/commit/faf82545c4e6d8a72f690107ba0b372868e7b508) of `dagre-d3` for UI to render DAG graphics for jobs, stages and plans.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the fork can be summarized as follows:\r\n- (1) Add identifiers to the `class` of clusters and nodes for late retrieving\r\n- (2) Calculate the coordinates and size for complex clusters. For example,\r\n   - The width of `Stage 8` must fit the maximum width of its child clusters, which are `AQEShuffleRead`, `WholeStageCodegen (8)` and `mapPartitionsInternal`, and also fit its label text length.\r\n   - The height of `Stage 8` needs to be increased to display its label on the top right corner to avoid overlapping, which also needs to add the max increment of its children.  \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8326978/e8055fca-2234-4811-867d-ac7eb45c5a92)\r\n   \r\n\r\nIn this PR,\r\n- To achieve the goal of (1), we apply `id` for graph/cluster/node in dot-file, which will be rendered as `HTML/SVG element id. And use id for selections.\r\n- To achieve the goal of (2), we post-process it right after rendering the dot file. Especially for job graph rendering, we need to complete it before rendering the second dot file, as we need to deliver the final coordinates to the follower.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, tooltips for WholeStageCodegen clusters on the execution page are supported. It's convenient for users to learn the information of a plan node when it is out of the screen.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAvoid fork and custom upstream libs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, tooltips for WholeStageCodegen clusters on the execution page are supported; otherwise, mainly code refactoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually,\r\n\r\n#### use case\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT   Avg(t1.id)\r\nFROM     RANGE(1) t1\r\njoin
