you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n<h1>Changes</h1>\r\n\r\n-  Instead of keeping a Set of referencing `ComponentNode`, keep a Map which stores, for each referencing component, also the name of the property for which the service is referenced\r\n   -  This has been decided (instead for example keeping a counter of the references for each referencing component) to keep the `addReference()` idempotent\r\n- `StandardControllerService.referencingComponents` changed from `HashSet` to `HashMap`\r\n    -  `Key` is the combination of `ComponentNode.hashCode()` and `PropertyDescriptor.name`\r\n    -  `Value` is the referencing `ComponentNode`\r\n- `ControllerServiceNode.addReference()` now requires a tuple (referencing `ComponentNode`, property name)\r\n- `ControllerServiceNode.removeReference()` now requires a tuple (referencing `ComponentNode`, property name)\r\n- `ControllerServiceNode.getReferences()` signature is left untouched, when it's called, the values of the `referencingComponents` map are turned into a Set, meaning a referencing component will keep being returned by this method until at least one of its properties still reference the `ControllerService`\r\n- `StandardSchedulingContext.leaseControllerService()` uses a dedicated constant instead of the `PropertyDescriptor.name`, from the documentation, the delete will be automatically done when the referencing component does not exist anymore\r\n- `FrameworkIntegrationTest.testReferenceCounts()` is a jira-comment inspired test which creates a processor with two optional controller service properties and then verifies that having them referencing and dereferencing the same controller service doesn't cause the reported bug anymore\r\n\r\n<h1>UPDATE</h1>\r\nAs per suggestions:\r\n\r\n-  `StandardControllerServiceNode.referencingComponents` evolved from Map<String, ComponentNode> to Set<Tuple<ComponentNode, PropertyDescriptor>>\r\n\r\n- `StandardSchedulingContext.leaseControllerService()` uses `PropertyDescriptor.NULL_DESCRIPTOR` instead of a `String` constant\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe code in this change-set enables support for encrypted flow file repositories.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this change-set enables transparent encrypted data processing by way of the `CipherInputStream` and `CipherOutputStream` classes.  The classes  `HashMapSnapshot` and `LengthDelimitedJournal` have been updated to use these stream classes for transparent encryption and decryption.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion\r\n\r\nThis approach uses the Bouncy Castle `CipherInputStream` and `CipherOutptStream` with an `AEADBlockCipher` configured for stream encryption.  This means:\r\n\r\n- flow file data is encrypted as it is written\r\n- flow file data is decrypted as it is read\r\n- streams written to disk are incomplete until the stream is closed; MACs are written at the end of the stream\r\n- streams read from disk are be verified against tampering and corruption\r\n\r\nThe effect of this implementation is to ignore data that cannot be verified; under high load scenarios, for example, using this encryption method will result in increased data loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Upgrading that to a newer version solves this problem.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n- Adding FlowFileFilter provider at DBCPService interface, so that processors can filter input FlowFiles based on service specific rules.\r\n- Implemented filtering rule at DBCPConnectionPoolLookup to guarantee all input FlowFiles have the same 'database.name' attribute.\r\n- Changed Put.initConnection from using a single FlowFile to a list of FlowFiles, so that each implementation can handle connection establishment with multiple FlowFiles correctly.\r\n- NOTE: Put.initConnection didn't use any FlowFile if there're more than 1 FlowFiles fetched. This PR changed that behavior but it should be fine since PutSQL is the only implementation that allows multiple incoming FlowFiles.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

modification updates the getStatusHistory method of\r\nVolatileComponentStatusRepository to utilize the start, end, and\r\npreferredDataPoints parameters when retrieving status histories.\r\n\r\nWhen calling the various get<XXXX>StatusHistory methods of\r\nVolatileComponentStatusRepository, they are all passed start, end,\r\nand preferredDataPoints values to allow the filtering of histories\r\naccording to the provided parameters. But the follow-on method calls ignore\r\nthose values completely. This ticket updates those methods to honor the\r\nparameters and filter the returned Dates accordingly.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAnother approach to address RAW S2S illegal blocking mode error on Java 11 reported with NIFI-5952. \r\nWhile #3265 refactors NOT to use NIO (thread/conn instead), this PR tries implementing NIO correctly.\r\n\r\nPerformance test confirmed NIO S2S can support 2,000 concurrent connections while thread/conn can only accept few hundreds.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state as it has SocketTimeout issue at secured NiFi environment in some situations. Still investigating that issue, but sending a PR for early code review.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nExcessive connections created when get/publish operations continually fail\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nPublishJMS repeatedly threw \"ResourceAllocationException: too many open connections\" after successive publish failures due to issues on the remote JMS Broker. The cause of this is the specification and implementation of the JMSConnectionFactoryProviderDefinition.resetConnectionFactory(ConnectionFactory cf) method. Setting the ConnectionFactory to null may well indeed close connections upon 'destruction', but it may take awhile for the GC to run; in the meantime, more connections are opened. The connections need to be manually closed rather than waiting for a GC.\r\n\r\nFrom AbstractJMSProcessor.onTrigger(), need to call worker.shutdown() prior to resetConnectionFactory().\r\n\r\nAlso, noticed some problems iwth the ConnectionFactoryProviderDefinition implementatoins wrt the resetConnectionFactory methods. The factory is nulled but never re-initialized but for onEnabled(); which will lead to a NPE at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdd dynamic relationships to the ExecuteScriptProcessor.\r\n\r\nThe previous relationships `SUCCESS` and `FAILURE` are kept for backwards compability. The variable of type `Map<String, Relationship>` `rel` is introduced. If the processor has a dynamic property with name like `rel.my_new_relationship`, a relationship of name `my_new_relationship` is added.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ x ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ x ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ x ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ x ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ x ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ x ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ x ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ x ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-21T07:40:48Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T00:05:09Z","closed_at":"2021-05-11T00:05:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a49e2d52fac7d03d109fddbb058c8d5f0704d123","assignee":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2915399856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE1Mzk5ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/4c22016e8b4894ad5741767e2e513fb650c81e8a","head":{"label":"performance-media:nifi-6388","ref":"nifi-6388","sha":"4c22016e8b4894ad5741767e2e513fb650c81e8a","user":{"login":"performance-media","id":49673615,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ5NjczNjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49673615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media","html_url":"https://github.com/performance-media","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192983853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI5ODM4NTM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"performance-media/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"performance-media","id":49673615,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ5NjczNjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49673615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media","html_url":"https://github.com/performance-media","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/performance-media/repos","events_url":"https://api

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nProcessor takes a FlowFile. It will then look for a retry attribute on the FlowFile. If none is present or if the designated retry attribute is set and not a number, the retry attribute is set to \"1\" and passed to a retry relationship.\r\nA configurable PropertyDescriptor contains the maximum number of times the FlowFile can be retried before being passed to a separate retries exceeded relationship. This PropertyDescriptor should have a validator for allowable positive integers for the retry.\r\nProcessor may also conditionally penalize the FlowFile on the retry relationship.\r\n \r\nMany interactions with NiFi request some information from a service and retry if the response isn't explicitly success. While it's quite common to use UpdateAttribute followed by a RouteOnAttribute to do this, there could be value in having a discreet processor for this.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.","created_at":"2019-06-21T01:31:56Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T06:03:20Z","closed_at":"2019-07-05T06:03:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df761d017fd7f0fc501fd936afd517ec1a33fd54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/ffc0881506fd5054754c5dab6356e04887258f04","head":{"label":"travisneeley:NIFI-6387","ref":"NIFI-6387","sha":"ffc0881506fd5054754c5dab6356e04887258f04","user":{"login":"travisneeley","id":52019722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDE5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52019722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley","html_url":"https://github.com/travisneeley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192833366,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI4MzMzNjY=","name":"nifi","full_name":"travisneeley/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"travisneeley","id":52019722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDE5NzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52019722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley","html_url":"https://github.com/travisneeley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/travisneeley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/travisneeley/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdding an ordering mechanism something like 'order by priority attribute grouped by signal id':\r\n\r\n- Added an internal state at Wait to track when each signal.id should be checked again in case it did not match release criteria\r\n- Added a Wait processor property to specify signal.id re-check duration, \"Wait Penalize Duration\"\r\n    - Similar to what 'Penalty Duration' does, but not for per FlowFile, but for signal.id unit. This is required because if there are multiple signal.ids, 'aa' and 'bb', then each signal.id has multiple FlowFiles with different priority. When Wait processor checks signal.id 'aa' and found 'aa' is not notified yet, it needs to check 'bb' at the next run\r\n- Added FlowFile filtering at Wait processor using above data to decide which signal.id to check\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

test failures in nifi-couchbase-processors, BinaryDocument matcher replaced with ByteArrayDocument\r\nFixed test failures in nifi-riemann-processors, anyInt() matcher replaced with anyLong() matcher, calling method passes a long, not int\r\nRemoved unnecessary method mocks from nifi-toolkit-tls tests, TlsCertificateAuthorityServiceHandlerTest and TlsCertificateSigningRequestPerformerTest, since those were flagged by Mockito as unnecessary (they're unused)\r\nRemoved explicit mockito dependency version in nifi-gcp-processors pom to inherit version from nifi's pom.xml\r\nUpdated ArgumentMatchers in Kafka 0.10, 0.11, 1.0, and 2.0 processor tests, since in Mockito 2.x, the \"any\" matchers no longer allow nulls\r\nUpdated ArgumentMatchers in nifi-jolt-transform-json-ui, since

matching does not work the same in Java 8 and 11\r\nUpdated TestStandardProcessScheduler to allow null values during mock invocations, Mockito 2.x no longer allows nulls in those matchers\r\nUpdated

Mockito 2.x flagged several interactions as unused and were adjusted to 0 interactions.\r\nUpdated PowerMock and Mockito dependencies to exclude transitive dependency on bytebuddy, added explicit dependency on bytebuddy 1.9.10 so that PowerMock and Mockito use the same version.

of PR**\r\n\r\nController services such as the JsonRecordSetWriter do no take into account the precision and scale in the case of Avro logical decimal types. While this may not be classified as a bug since the output is Json and not Avro, this improvement should help eliminate any misunderstandings between the different serialisations.\r\n\r\nThis should also improve functionality of other processors making use of such utils.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you to ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n\r\n- [X]  Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X]  Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X]  Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [X]  Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not squash or use --force when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes.\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [X]  Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n\r\n- [X]  Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nController services such as the JsonSetRecordWriter do no take into account the precision and scale in the case of Avro logical decimal types. While this may not be classified as a bug since the output is Json and not Avro, this improvement should help eliminate any misunderstandings between the different serialisations. \r\n\r\nThis should also improve functionality of other processors making use of such utils.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis is a followup PR to #3500 . It enables true re-usage of the evaluator tree once created for a prepared query in nifi's expression language. This, at least in our case, saves a ton of CPU.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a lot of tests for functions with stateful evaluators. This wasn't covered before.\r\n\r\n#3500 was closed by me because the approach I took there was not thread safe. Instead of cleaning up the state in evaluators I now introduced a context that gets passed through a tree for each evaluation to get rid of state in the evaluators itself. All evaluators that need state (mostly for performance reasons) can store that state in the context. A new context is created for each evaluation. That should also result in lower garbage collection impact, because we are only throwing away the state that needs to be thrown away not the whole evaluator tree again and again.\r\n\r\nAnother related pull request is #3277 but that takes a different approach and only helps if no stateful evaluators are used in an expression. It also doesn't cover `and` + `or` even though they have state. Even if those will be excluded from optimization, I don't think it's the best approach because there are a ton of expressions (at least in our production scenario) that use functions that have stateful evaluators.\r\n\r\nSome profiling tests we did show a performance improvement when compared with the current master (60b5c13ce95fd4d4a5edf0f08b81af19e71b67ee).\r\n\r\nThis is the test code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testPerformance() {\r\n    final Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<String, String>() {{\r\n        put(\"hello\", \"Hello\");\r\n        put(\"boat\", \"World!\");\r\n    }};\r\n    final StandardPreparedQuery prepared = (StandardPreparedQuery) Query.prepare(\"${allAttributes('hello', 'boat'):isEmpty():not():and(${hello:contains('o')})}\");\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\r\n        assertEquals(\"true\", prepared.evaluateExpressions(attributes, null));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCPU Time for the evaluation loop (instrumented code):\r\ncurrent master - 97.48s\r\nthis PR - 23.78s\r\n\r\n->75% performance improvement\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
