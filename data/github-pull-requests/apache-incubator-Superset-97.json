SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn the new database modal flow we have 2 different flows:\r\n\r\n- In the old APIs (`test_connection`, add/edit DB) we expect `engine` inside `parameters`.\r\n- In the new API (`validate_parameters`) it should be outside.\r\n\r\nIt's better to have a consistent way, and it's also better to have engine outside of parameters, so I fixed the old APIs to support both initially, to prevent breaking the frontend. Later we can remove support for passing `engine` inside `parameters` and only accept it outside.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a new per-database configuration option to disable data preview queries in SQL Lab. This setting is exposed in the database API as `preview_data`. I decided to add the feature to the database API and pass the database as a parameter to `addTable` rather than adding a database setting into a table API response (the proposed solution in #14726). As a result the data preview query was moved up to `addTable` as well. To my eye that looks cleaner since I don't think that previewing data should be a part of \"table metadata\" anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is no UI change, though the UX changes when data preview is disabled to not show the data preview pane (or results) when getting table metadata.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. In the database configuration settings, add `\"preview_data\": false` to the \"Extra\" JSON object.\r\n2. In SQL Editor, select the database you have configured, and then any schema or table.\r\n    - Alternately, trigger metadata to load from the editor textbox itself.\r\n3. Table metadata should load as normal, but no data preview query should run.\r\n4. When `preview_data` is true (or the key does not exist), a data preview query should run when selecting a table from the dropdown or triggering metadata to be loaded from the editor.\r\n \r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAllow impersonating the user when using GSheets.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the user sets up a GSheets DB with credentials, the user has access to **all** spreadsheets from a given domain. With this change, enabling user impersonation will ensure that the user has access only to spreadsheets that they should have.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have the email roberto@dealmeida.net. If someones shares a spreadsheet with the \"Dealmeida.net\" organization I'll have access to it. But if someone shares a spreadsheets with \"ceo@dealmeida.net\", with this PR I won't be able to access it. Without the PR, or with user impersonation disabled, I would have access because the service account credentials have access to everything in the domain.\r\n\r\nWe had this set up at Lyft via a `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR`, but this is a cleaner and simpler approach.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI tested manually with my domain, \"dealmeida.net\". I was able to access only the correct spreadsheets.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n Improves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 2.\r\n\r\n- Adds the Basic and Advanced collapse panels\r\n- Moves the column field alongside the dataset field\r\n- Sets `min-width` to the modal to deal with resizing\r\n- Adjusts the borders, padding and margins to the new layout\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Split the controllers and organize them in the Basic and Advanced sections\r\n- Expand the Basic section by default\r\n- Add the ability to render a controller dynamically using checkboxes\r\n- Handle the correct tab selection when validating\r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n- Split the `FiltersConfigForm` into smaller components to make it easier to read\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** this change should enable async queries for public/anonymous users.\r\n\r\nThe async queries experience runs queries in Celery workers instead of during the web request. Queries check some state against the requesting user (e.g., `can_access`) and assumes the presence of a `flask.g.user` object. The Celery workers therefore need to set the user on `flask.g` which today they do for requests that were initiated by a logged in user. However, it is broken for anonymous users since there is no user id to pass to the Celery workers.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nManual\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nI didn't seem to find a cleaner way to grab a reference to an anonymous user. Interested to know if there's a better approach than reaching into flask login for this. @dpgaspar maybe?\r\n\r\ncc @robdiciuccio @dpgaspar

SUMMARY\r\nThis is addressing the fix found in: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14719\r\n\r\nThis adds testing to the ResultSet spec file that checks to make sure that either queryLimit or query.results.limit is present. Without either of these ResultSet throws an error which crashes SqlLab.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nThis adds two new tests to ResultSet, checking to make sure that it renders correctly if either of these are present. I also added limit to the query fixture. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n`DndColumnSelect` was working correctly only for controls that accept multiple values. When used with controls that had `multi: false` prop, it displayed a prompt to add more columns and behaved weirdly - sometimes it allowed adding more values, sometimes it replaced the first value with whatever user dropped last. This PR fixes those glitches and unifies the behaviour with with `DndMetricSelect` - after the first value is added, prompt disappears and adding new columns is disabled.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67837651/119038421-f352ec00-b967-11eb-96e4-16daf1f439ee.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67837651/119038451-fa79fa00-b967-11eb-952a-c110f298d8cf.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nOpen a chart that uses `DndColumnSelect` for single value controls (e.g. Country Map and \"ISO 3166-2 CODES\" control), verify that only 1 value can be added and there are no glitches when you try to add more values. Please don't mind type label overlapping with column name, the fix is ready in a different PR üôÇ \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen the feature flag `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` is set to False, user data is currently saved in local storage. A recent change added roles information to the bootstrap user object. But with the flag off, local storage data ends up overwriting the bootstrap data, and the roles are lost, which breaks the page. This change removes user data from local storage, and prevents it from overwriting the bootstrap data.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n- Turn the flag off\r\n- checkout a commit from before [a7a011cce5ea9a9ae6cebf40b6e5bc6257d7746d](https://github.com/apache/superset/commit/a7a011cce5ea9a9ae6cebf40b6e5bc6257d7746d)\r\n- visit sql lab, execute a query (loads your user into localstorage)\r\n- checkout this fix\r\n- visit sql lab (user is removed from localstorage and page should show up)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

This unfortunately requires a code change, as this list of fields is whitelisted today.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe UI lets a user control whether a particular datasource supports impersonation, which is very helpful when creating it interactively. However, when exporting the datasource or importing it programmatically, the value for `impersonate_user` is not exported/imported, leading to a gap in functionality.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for \"Search all filter options\" option to native select filter to obtain feature parity with same functionality in Filter Box. Other changes:\r\n- Filter Box performed a manual case insensitive comparison for the search all filter functionality by adding the following WHERE clause to the query: `lower(${key}) like '%${input}%'`, which only worked on those backends that support the `lower` function (a non-ANSI SQL function). This has been replaced by the following logic\r\n  - For string columns, we perform a native case insensitive filter by utilizing the SqlAlchemy `ILIKE` operator ( https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ColumnElement.ilike ). This makes it possible to utilize the `ILIKE` operator where supported, e.g. on Postgres.\r\n  - For numeric columns, perform a `>=` operator. Previously the Filter Box would fail silently for numeric columns, as it tried to call `lower()` on the numeric column, which usually doesn't work.\r\n- Byproduct: Add `ILIKE` operator option to adhoc filter popover (see screenshot)\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nSee below how searching for entries that don't fit into the first 1000 entries are found when the feature is enabled:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119319233-d88fb880-bc82-11eb-9a11-e63aca9e243f.mp4\r\n\r\nAlso add case case insensitive LIKE operator to adhoc filter popover to support `ILIKE` [SqlAlchemy operator](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ColumnElement.ilike):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119321686-95831480-bc85-11eb-887e-d13ebd1f7482.png)\r\n\r\nAlso

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nTwo small fixes for the import functionality:\r\n\r\n1. The schema for importing the `extra` field in datasets was incorrect, preventing datasets to be imported.\r\n2. The SQLAlchemy URI was being parsed with `urllib.parse.urlparse` to extract the password, but that failed on a Vertica URI (`vertica+vertica_python://hackathon:XXXXXXXXXX@host:5433/dbname?ssl=1`).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a dataset doesn't have any saved metrics, the initial value of Metrics control is empty. There is a warning displayed in chart container, however data table(south) runs a query anyway. This PR fixes that behaviour - when control panel generates errors, they are passed down to data table(south) and displayed and no request to backend is sent.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/118640552-64b06480-b7d9-11eb-8c1c-f7452dc0408c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/118640399-3468c600-b7d9-11eb-868c-35afe27029f2.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis builds on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14568 and https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14650 by swapping out the remaining occurrences of code that conditionally registers resources during startup. It should now be possible to flip config/feature values on/off without restarting the server.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nI enabled some disabled tests and added many more. I also tested many of these endpoints manually.\r\n\r\ncc @robdiciuccio @craig-rueda @dpgaspar

SUMMARY\r\nThis adds the quirks of Ascend.io's database to be handled using the Impala driver.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm unsure if this approach for adding the db_engine_specs is the desired method, so I welcome feedback for needed changes.\r\n\r\nEdit: I have modified the PR as my proposed changes for modifying get_table_names has been accepted in the latest Impala driver upstream, so there is no need for that when using impyla>=0.17a8 (should be released shortly).\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Adds ascend:// db_engine_spec that uses the Impala/Impyla driver\r\n2. Use the default postgres time grain expressions to make charts work\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\nRequires https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1114\r\n\r\nChanges default Time Range from \"Last week\" to \"No filter\"\r\nChanges using \"COUNT(*)\" or other saved metric as a default metric to empty metrics control.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Table chart, removing default metric was a bit more complex. We use Groupby, Metrics and Percentage Metrics there, and at least one of them must have a value to construct a correct query. However, we can only write control validator that use values of its own control - for instance, we can't create a validator for groupby that checks if metrics or percentage_metrics are empty or not. We also couldn't simply mark all 3 controls as required, as only 1 is really required. The result was that upon creating a table chart, an incorrect request to backend was sent and we displayed an Empty query? error. It was quite a bad user experience - a strange error was the first thing that user sees after creating a chart (and what's more, we sent a query that we knew would fail).\r\nFor that reason, I created something like a \"dynamic\" validator - we check the state of groupby, metrics and percentage_metrics in mapStateToProps field of groupby in `superset-ui/plugins/plugin-chart-table/src/controlPanel.tsx`. If all of those fields are empty, we set an error in a new field externalValidationErrors. Since mapStateToProps function is run only when the field changes, we needed a way to trigger it when not only groupby, but also metrics or percentage_metrics fields change. To achieve that, I added a field rerender: ['groupby'] to metrics and percentage_metrics. It is later checked in superset/superset-frontend/src/explore/reducers - if rerender array exists, it triggers getControlStateFromControlConfig for each control in rerender array, which in turn triggers mapStateToProps of that control. Then, externalValidationErrors are merged with calculated validationErrors.\r\nCheckout the video to see the result.\r\n\r\nCC: @villebro @junlincc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/118494563-94506580-b722-11eb-9015-845ff0cdb632.mov\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-17 at 10 45 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/118467253-f188ee80-b703-11eb-9b75-b87d17204308.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nPull https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1114, link superset-ui/chart-controls and superset-ui/plugin-chart-table (`npm link ../../../superset-ui/plugins/plugin-chart-table ../../../superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-chart-controls`). Then create some new charts and verify that metrics is empty by default and time range filter is set to \"No filter\". Create a table chart and verify that at least 1 of Groupby, Metrics and Percentage Metrics must have a value to send a query, otherwise a warning message should be displayed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #14547 introduced a performance regression causing dataset metadata fetching to become very slow for datasets with large numbers of columns. I originally thought the type regexes were the problem, but when researching the problem more closely it turns out that just referencing `self.table.database.db_engine_spec` in a `TableColumn` instance cost ~6ms on my local machine. Multiply that by 1000 columns ~= 6000 ms. To get around this I added memoization to the semi-expensive regex, but also added memoizing for `Database.db_engine_spec`. This should also speed up query rendering a bit, as there was similar logic there.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE #14547 (pre-regression)\r\nFor the World Bank dataset (328 cols), fetching the data took slightly less than 180ms before on my local machine (including the unnecessary 20 ms redirect):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/118236149-665aef00-b49e-11eb-872f-7f4cbfc637d9.png)\r\n\r\n### CURRENT (master)\r\nFor the same dataset, retrieval of data now

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe SubMenu component was recently re-jiggered to use a grid (row/col) layout, and the text/header was given a fixed width, which caused line-wrapping. This PR uses the Row component's automatic layout to avoid this.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI was testing the new validation API for DB parameters and realized that it would fail in certain cases because the SIP-41 handler uses `dataclasses.asdict`, which doesn't play nice with `defaultdict` (https://bugs.python.org/issue35540).\r\n\r\nI added custom code to handle the payload with `defaultdict` in case there's a validation error, converting to a normal dict.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRumor has it that the `pip-compile-multi` ecosystem was likely borked, probably due to changes which i) used an improper version of `pip-compile-multi/pip-tools`, or ii) updates to `setup.py` etc. which didn't update the pinned requirements.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `pip-compile-multi` and updates the `requirements/*.txt` files without upgrading any of the packages, via:\r\n\r\n``` \r\npip-compile-multi --only-name integration --upgrade-package pip-compile-multi \r\npython3.8 -m pip install -r requirements/integration.txt \r\npip-compile-multi --no-upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote we likely should look into something like http://dependabot.com/ or similar for ensuring dependencies remain fresh. See the Slack thread in the #committers channel [here](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1620958894165300) for more detail.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0.0 of the [itsdangerous](https://pypi.org/project/itsdangerous/#history) package was recently released (May 12, 2021) which replaces the  `simplejson`  with `json` which cannot decode `decimal.Decimal` objects, i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n  File \"/srv/superset-internal/superset-fork/superset/utils/core.py\", line 1407, in time_function\r\n    response = func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/flask_appbuilder/api/__init__.py\", line 1499, in get_list_headless\r\n    return self.response(200, **_response)\r\n...\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.8/json/encoder.py\", line 179, in default\r\n    raise TypeError(f'Object of type {o.__class__.__name__} '\r\nTypeError: Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable\r\n```\r\n\r\nEventually when we update Flask we will need to deal with this as it also removes `simplejson` (https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3555) and doesn't rely on on  `itsdangerous` for defining which JSON package to use per https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3562.\r\n\r\nI tried using the logic they suggested (to help future proof ourselves), i.e., in `superset/app.py`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom simplejson import JSONEncoder\r\n\r\n\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\napp.json_encoder = JSONEncoder\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever I ran into a somewhat similar problem, \r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n  File \"/srv/superset-internal/superset-fork/superset/utils/core.py\", line 1407, in time_function\r\n    response = func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/flask_appbuilder/api/__init__.py\", line 1499, in get_list_headless\r\n    return self.response(200, **_response)\r\n...\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/simplejson/encoder.py\", line 272, in default\r\n    raise TypeError('Object of type %s is not JSON serializable' %\r\nTypeError: Object of type Table is not JSON serializable\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is somewhat perplexing, i.e., I'm not sure why this is problematic and I couldn't find any JSON encoders in Superset, Flask, or Flask-SQLAlchemy which handled serializing SQLAlchemy `Table` objects. For now to remedy any issues resulting from `pip installing` Apache Superset I thought there was merit in simply restricting the version of `itsdangerous`.\r\n\r\nNote the generated requirements were updated via, \r\n\r\n```\r\npip-compile-multi --only-name base --upgrade-package itsdangerous \r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a case where users who were not owners of a dashboard were incorrectly seeing the \"Edit\" button. This is not a security hole as the users cannot successfully submit their edits, but it was incorrect UI that needed to be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe frontend was incorrectly inferring dashboard edit permissions. This change fixes the issue by copying logic from the backend's [check_ownership](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d31958cbd2e980a5c186334e718fa71ed8d12e74/superset/views/base.py#L569) function. \r\n\r\nThe code of the frontend version implements the same check, while being much simpler than the backend version due to being a pure function, dashboard-specific, and not having parameterized function behavior.\r\n\r\nI did this instead of changing endpoints, because the caching of the existing dashboard endpoints depends on returning the same data to all users, and because implementing a new endpoint to just return a boolean felt wrong.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n1. Log in as a user with \"Alpha\" role (or other non-admin role with dashboard edit permissions)\r\n1. View a dashboard of which you are an owner - you should be able to edit\r\n1. View a dashboard of which you are **not** an owner - you should **not** be able to edit\r\n1. Log in as an admin: you should be able to edit any dashboard, regardless of ownership\r\n1. Log in as a user without dashboard edit permissions (e.g. Gamma role): You should not be able to edit any dashboard, regardless of ownership\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any
