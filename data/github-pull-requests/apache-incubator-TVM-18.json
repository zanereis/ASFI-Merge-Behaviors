PR adds support for the functional variants of `linear` and `conv2d` in the relax fx importer. I was trying out using the fx path to import SDXL and found that it generated functional nodes. After this change, the full import goes smoothly.\r\n\r\nI also made a change to `_fetch_attr`. Previously it would always create a new constant, however, in some cases graphs might be trying to fetch a parameter. This showed up quite a bit in SDXL due to the use of functional compute ops. Creating new constants caused a bunch of duplication in parameters. I added a check to see if the fetched value was in `self.params` and return that if so. I think this is strictly better behavior.","created_at":"2023-08-15T21:11:17Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T19:31:35Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T19:30:35Z","merged_at":"2023-08-17T19:30:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac3078c7f553398424d4677175de9e7147f12a2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/65c623d22cc4e74813cd738ca010deefea7671ba","head":{"label":"jwfromm:fx_linear_conv","ref":"fx_linear_conv","sha":"65c623d22cc4e74813cd738ca010deefea7671ba","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

VTA runtime uses `memalign` in two places to allocate aligned memory. While technically deprecated, this function does usually work in typical software environments. However, when working with mixed C/C++ runtime environments, this approach can error catastrophically as the two languages allocate the same memory pages on their respective heaps. These two instances of `memalign`/`free` are the only two remaining ones which use C-like allocation APIs. Therefore, this PR moves these over to `std::aligned_alloc`/`std::free` in order to fully standardize on C++ allocation APIs and avoid this issue.","created_at":"2023-08-14T22:10:14Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:12:32Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T00:12:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f696c72aa9f46ec78d4360d5da06a428c4518775","head":{"label":"grg-haas:bugfix/vta-runtime","ref":"bugfix/vta-runtime","sha":"f696c72aa9f46ec78d4360d5da06a428c4518775","user":{"login":"grg-haas","id":12552576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTUyNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12552576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas","html_url":"https://github.com/grg-haas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":678577509,"node_id":"R_kgDOKHJFZQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"grg-haas/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grg-haas","id":12552576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTUyNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12552576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas","html_url":"https://github.com/grg-haas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grg-haas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grg-haas/tvm","description":"Open

constructor. \r\nSince it requires explicit passing of the default arguments, I'd like to find a way to support previous usage (e.g., `VDevice()`) without the ambiguity. But I don't have good idea at the moment unfortunately. \r\ncc. @yongwww

TVM Plugin Autogen Tool**\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** This PR is based on Tencent's [TPAT](https://github.com/Tencent/TPAT).\r\n\r\n**Purpose:** Tencent's TPAT should be used with their TVM fork: [BlazerML-tvm](https://github.com/Tencent/BlazerML-tvm), but they haven't synchronized it with the upstream for a long time, also some bugs are not resolved. In light of these issues, I decide to try integrating it to TVM.\r\n\r\n**Objective:** The primary goal is to offer a clear and user-friendly API.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/37768049/176a7932-88a0-48a4-b53e-9d62d263a40e)\r\n\r\n*Currently, only TensorRT is supported.*\r\n\r\nIn essence, this solution is built upon the Template Engine (Jinja) in Python to create plugin templates for vendor-specific acceleration libraries. It then utilizes TVM for optimization and code generation targeting the respective platforms. The generated code is rendered and filled into the templates. Subsequently, platform-specific build commands are invoked to build the plugins, which ultimately serve as extensions for the corresponding vendor's acceleration library.\r\n\r\n## Inputs & Outputs\r\n\r\nThe [entry](\r\nhttps://github.com/Civitasv/tvm/blob/2e68c8b66fc918614e801197035fd71b057f77e2/python/tvm/tpat/cuda/pipeline.py#L61-L63\r\n) of TPAT for TensorRT is as follows: \r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef pipeline(\r\n    onnx_file: str, node_names: list[str], enable_tunning: bool, work_dir: str, output_onnx: str\r\n) -> Tuple[str, list[str]]:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis entry point accepts an ONNX file, a list of nodes to be tuned, the log database location, and the output ONNX file path where the modified model will be stored.\r\n\r\nAfter generating plugins for each node, the function returns the path of the output ONNX file along with a list of paths where the plugins are saved, facilitating subsequent loading.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] User should have the ability to change tunning option.\r\n- [ ] Add benchmark section.\r\n- [ ] Currently, the frontend is Relay, the tunning method is MetaSchedule, we should a flexible way to support Relax and other tunning method.\r\n- [ ] Consider potential improvements to the API on the C++ side. Currently I use some global variables, then register global functions to get these variables, it feels like a hack to me, anyway, I'm not quite familiar with TVM's way to do it, so please give me some advice.\r\n- [ ] Explore dynamic batch support, currently, only static batch is supported, the original repo supports it, but I think it's a little mess, I believe there exists a more elegant way to support this feature.\r\n- [ ] Investigate the generation of QNN plugins for Qualcomm platforms.\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\n- [Introduction of Tencent's

to this commit, the checks for a dynamic strided slice were implemented differently on the python and C++ sides.  In Python, strided slice delegated to dynamic strided slice whenever the begin/end was a `te.Tensor`.  In C++, strided slice delegated to dynamic strided slice whenever the begin/end was not a list of static integers.  As a result, a list of TIR expressions would pass the Python checks for strided slice, but be delegated to dynamic strided slice within the C++ implementation.  Because dynamic strided slice did not support the `axes` argument, any `axes` specified would be silently ignored.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements `dynamic_strided_slice_with_axes`, and delegates to it or the previous `dynamic_strided_slice` depending on whether the `axes` are present.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #15450, which allowed dynamic begin/end expressions in `relax.op.strided_slice`.  This issue was first noticed in a relax graph with variable (but compile-time) bounds on begin/end.","created_at":"2023-08-10T14:12:20Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T14:19:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T14:19:10Z","merged_at":"2023-08-17T14:19:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"684218f72d5d4856188e99f8073855ed9a722d55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15520/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15520/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15520/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c164184f2f146e8915a1cf7ee8991fe1eb171572","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_legalize_variable_bounds_in_strided_slice","ref":"unity_legalize_variable_bounds_in_strided_slice","sha":"c164184f2f146e8915a1cf7ee8991fe1eb171572","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

follow-up to PR #15450, which allowed dynamic begin/end expressions in `relax.op.strided_slice`.  If the shape of the output is static, such as a slice from `index:index+slice_size`, the relax operator will delegate to `topi.strided_slice`, but that may then delegate to `topi.dynamic_strided_slice` due to the dynamic begin/end.  In this case, the topi implementation inserts an additional output variable `\"dim\"`, without providing a definition.\r\n\r\nThis behavior works in topi, as the output shape variable may have a definition provided from the calling scope, when the output tensor is passed in.  However, even in topi, this behavior is fragile as it assumes that the Tensor output is the same as the resulting PrimFunc output.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the topi implementation of `strided_slice` to propagate the shape information from the

to this commit, the `relax::ExprMutator` forwards the original `ret_struct_info` when visiting a `relax::Function`.  While this allows the resulting function to have a more specific return type if the mutation no longer allows the shapes to be propagated across the entire body (e.g. preserving `R.Tensor(shape=[16,16])` even if shape propagation resulted in `R.Tensor(ndim=2)`), this also preserves information that is no longer correct due to the mutation.\r\n\r\nFor example, a mutator that implements `VisitVarDef_` to replace the shape of a function parameter would expect that updated shape to propagate through to the function return type.  By retaining the original return type, the mutator produces an incorrect return type.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `relax::ExprMutator` to only forward the original `ret_struct_info` if the mutated body's struct info is compatible with it.\r\n\r\nThis PR was co-authored with @farshidsp

#9375 has been rejected, I tried a different way to support `aten::copy_` op.\r\n\r\n`aten::copy_` behaves differently from other inplace ops, \"pure inplace\" way, unlike other inplace nodes' one, which output graph(`torch.Graph`) still relaying it's output to users so that a DAG can be structed. However, `aten::copy_` op returns itself, which dangles all of mutations.\r\n\r\nFor example, a torch module like\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):\r\n        x[:5, :5] = x[:5, :5] + 1\r\n        return x\r\n```\r\n\r\ngenerates the graph\r\n```\r\ngraph(%self : __torch__.Test,\r\n      %x : Float(10, 10, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu)):\r\n  %4 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %5 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %6 : int = prim::Constant[value=5]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %7 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %8 : Float(5, 10, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::slice(%x, %4, %5, %6, %7)\r\n  %9 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %10 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %11 : int = prim::Constant[value=5]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %12 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %13 : Float(5, 5, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::slice(%8, %9, %10, %11, %12)\r\n  %14 : Long(requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = prim::Constant[value={1}]()\r\n  %15 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %16 : Float(5, 5, strides=[5, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::add(%13, %14, %15)\r\n  %17 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %18 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %19 : int = prim::Constant[value=5]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %20 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %21 : Float(5, 10, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::slice(%x, %17, %18, %19, %20)\r\n  %22 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %23 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %24 : int = prim::Constant[value=5]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %25 : int = prim::Constant[value=1]() # /home/jhlee/tvm/test.py:10:0\r\n  %26 : Float(5, 5, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::slice(%21, %22, %23, %24, %25)\r\n  %27 : bool = prim::Constant[value=0]()\r\n  %28 : Float(5, 5, strides=[10, 1], requires_grad=0, device=cpu) = aten::copy_(%26, %16, %27)\r\n  return (%x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich returns `%x` itself.\r\n\r\nMy approach to handle this problem is:\r\n\r\n1. in `from_pytorch`, insert a pass that redirects output of `aten::copy_`(`_redirect_inplace_output`), after `_run_jit_passes` is called, in *torch level(`torch.Graph`)*\r\n2. when handling `aten::copy` node, we collect from it's parents to collect `aten::select` and `aten::slice` nodes, to generate indices of source. I referenced pytorch repository, behavior of [torch -> onnx conversion](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.0.1/torch/csrc/jit/passes/onnx/remove_inplace_ops_for_onnx.cpp#L175)\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with making a PR to this repository, so please let me know if there is any feedbacks or questions.","created_at":"2023-08-07T12:42:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T01:53:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T01:53:29Z","merged_at":"2023-10-19T01:53:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7aada1441abe79ec63eeae89a71a7033b23bac8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/50afcccf4a7f4c990f10f9fc7785e3634cf5e28d","head":{"label":"jhlee525:aten-copy-support","ref":"aten-copy-support","sha":"50afcccf4a7f4c990f10f9fc7785e3634cf5e28d","user":{"login":"jhlee525","id":6736676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzY2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6736676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525","html_url":"https://github.com/jhlee525","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436128704,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf7LwA","name":"tvm","full_name":"jhlee525/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jhlee525","id":6736676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzY2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6736676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525","html_url":"https://github.com/jhlee525","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhlee525/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jhlee525/tvm","description":"Open

is a pull request for MSC(Multi-System Compile)\r\nRFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-unity-msc-introduction-to-multi-system-compiler/15251/5\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the first part of Milestone 0: Build MSCGraph core parts. Enable translation between Relay, Relax and MSCGraph without loss information.\r\n\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 0 will be split into 5 steps:\r\nM0.1: Passes for set name and layout for expressions (src/contrib/msc/transform)\r\nM0.2: MSCGraph core (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph && python/tvm/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph)\r\nM0.3: MSCGraph Builder (src/contrib/msc/core/ir/graph_builder)\r\nM0.4: Codegen (src/contrib/msc/core/codegen, src/contrib/msc/framework/tvm/codegen)\r\nM0.5: Translation test (relax/relay test && related helper modules in python)\r\n\r\nThis is the M0.1 step. Passes are added to set name and layouts via Span. \r\nThe names are essential for developing optimization algorithms, especially when developer want to control the optimization tensor by tensor. This always happens in developing of advanced quantization.\r\nLayout is essential for pruning process, where channel relation between weights are built. And building channel relationship need layout of tensors to be set. Some quantization algorithm also need layout for quantize weights per channel or per token.\r\n\r\nThese attributes need to be set to Call, Constant as well as Var. So the best way is to find a common attributes holder for them all. In the end I chose span as the attributes holder, and special xml format like <key>value</kay> is used to mark key:value pair in span. \r\n\r\ncc

we have two paths for BYOC.\r\n\r\nPath1: `seq = [FuseOpsByPattern(patterns, annotate_codegen=False), MergeCompositeFunctions(), RunCodegen()]`\r\nPath2: `seq = [FuseOpsByPattern(patterns, annotate_codegen=True), RunCodegen()]`\r\n\r\nPath1 is used for inference engines such as TensorRT, DNNL, CoreML, etc. which are more efficient with larger subgraph and thus better off merge adjacent composite functions. In constrast, Path1 is used for kernel libraries, such as Cutlass, Cublas, and not need to merge. \r\n\r\nFor better UX, this PR aims to make both paths have same interface with various BYOC codegens. \r\nIn addition, it removes unnecessary `kPrimitive` attribute in the function that will be offloaded to external codegen.\r\nOne remaining caveat is that two paths would have different function names of each composite function and thus structural equality check would fail between two paths.  Instead, this PR compares each path to their expected forms which have the same interface except function names.  \r\n\r\nThis PR is P3 of CoreML tracker:

Compiler): Build MSCGraph core parts. Enable translation between Relay, Relax and MSCGraph without loss information.\r\n\r\nCore parts:\r\n1. MSCGraph: A DAG structure for store info from relax and relay. A MSCGraph can be build from relax or relay function\r\n2. Codegen: A printer to generate target codes. A MSCGraph can be translated to relax\r\n\r\nThis milestone add examples on translating relay to relax without loss information. This solution can be used to use relay-based features in relax, like quantization, pruning and some optimization passes.\r\n\r\nBoth python and cpp codes are managed in a new module, so there are no change to the current code base. To use MSC, just set the USE_MSC in config.cmake to

to this PR, the dlight matmul rule uses hardcoded `int64` as index dtype. When the input workload is `int32` dtyped and has symbolic vars like `n: T.int32`, the PrimFunc generated by the matmul rule may contain PrimExpr like\r\n```python\r\nT.Cast(\"int32\", T.Cast(\"int64\", n))\r\n```\r\nwhich is not wrong but not 100% correct.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the hardcoded `int64` to the dtype of the input block iters in the rule, and resolves the issue above.","created_at":"2023-08-04T17:40:12Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T20:29:29Z","closed_at":"2023-09-06T20:29:29Z","merged_at":"2023-09-06T20:29:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0869fecc426bff496c95e4d25ca5b987d1d0b49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

types.","created_at":"2023-08-04T12:50:58Z","updated_at":"2023-08-05T00:41:05Z","closed_at":"2023-08-05T00:41:01Z","merged_at":"2023-08-05T00:41:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"18467c95dd98b1a9a18a59fdfd3381bbdf40c5fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cyx-6","id":16838183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16838183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6","html_url":"https://github.com/cyx-6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyx-6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fd6b7ac320006cb4bb57c4c6beced248b18fe970","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:index-empty-tuple","ref":"index-empty-tuple","sha":"fd6b7ac320006cb4bb57c4c6beced248b18fe970","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":621959892,"node_id":"R_kgDOJRJa1A","name":"tvm","full_name":"kparzysz-quic/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic/tvm","description":"Open

from #15478.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue of the ThreadSync pass.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the pass is not aware of `shared.dyn` scope whose users all share a same shared memory space. This feature is not necessarily already revealed in the IR at the time of applying ThreadSync. This means that when applying ThreadSync, in the IR, each buffer of `shared.dyn` scope still uses its own data Var, and ThreadSync is thus unable to detect the conflict properly and insert the sync instructions properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly makes ThreadSync be aware of the `shared.dyn` scope, and redirect all the access vars of `shared.dyn` memory to a common var, so that ThreadSync analysis can find out the conflict and insert the sync

PR fixes an issue of the ThreadSync pass.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the pass is not aware of `shared.dyn` scope whose users all share a same shared memory space. This feature is not necessarily already revealed in the IR at the time of applying ThreadSync. This means that when applying ThreadSync, in the IR, each buffer of `shared.dyn` scope still uses its own data Var, and ThreadSync is thus unable to detect the conflict properly and insert the sync instructions properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly makes ThreadSync be aware of the `shared.dyn` scope, and redirect all the access vars of `shared.dyn` memory to a common var, so that ThreadSync analysis can find out the conflict and insert the sync instructions.","created_at":"2023-08-04T03:37:42Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T15:58:59Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T15:58:56Z","merged_at":"2023-08-04T15:58:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"543838303b4289bb5669688efb9f88b15ddc2ebe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7d11748ff0b05a6b52e1e9f01ea8f24a702ccda0","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-08-03-thread-sync","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-08-03-thread-sync","sha":"7d11748ff0b05a6b52e1e9f01ea8f24a702ccda0","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR implements a simple simplification pass that applies various other simplification passes until fixpoint (i.e., apply them until the module stops changing). This probably should not be part of the standard compilation, since it has the potential to repeat passes many times, but I doubt that we would be in danger of having it happen that much. I am certain that it terminates, since all of the passes included either make the module \"more simplified\" or leave it unchanged if they cannot find any opportunities to make changes (i.e., no pass has the potential to undo the work of other passes). Nevertheless, the pass includes an iteration limit in case passes are later added that in some situations do not converge (not recommended).\r\n\r\n~~Incidentally, it also fixes a bug that I happened to discover in the binding canonicalization pass: It did not handle the case of a non-dataflow var being bound to a dataflow var and gave a segfault if it was encountered.~~\r\n\r\nA few points of discussion:\r\n1. I wasn't sure if constant folding should be included in this. I am not sure new opportunities for constant folding could arise with these passes, though maybe it's possible (if we could come up with an example).\r\n2. There are many normalizations happening between each round but I encountered a bug when I tried to go function-by-function (StructInfo would not update correctly), so this manner of implementation ensures fewer headaches. Passes all assume that the input has been normalized so not doing it every time has the potential to cause unexpected errors.\r\n3. Are there more simplifications we would like to throw in here? Lots of little passes like the dataflow block output folding behavior would now be a lot more feasible to just throw in here and see some use.","created_at":"2023-08-03T19:10:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T02:21:48Z","closed_at":"2023-11-17T02:21:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0bdaf140dc415a55e963ffea1e4f610b2a498a1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

the fallback used when compiling a dense operation with targets such as `llvm -device=arm_cpu` is `dense.generic`. This results in very poor performance. Although https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13775 meant that x86 schedules are used in cases where no strategy is provided by arm_cpu, the dense strategy is registered due to the existence of specialized schedules for arm_cpu e.g. a schedule for embedded devices. This commit ensures x86 schedules are used inplace of a generic schedule which yields much better performance.\r\n\r\nThe commit also follows the same approach for the `dense.generic` schedule as the x86 strategy. This will only be used when auto-scheduler is enabled.\r\n\r\nA test has been added to check the intended schedules are picked when compiling with `arm_cpu`.\r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @neildhickey

slightly altered the behaviour when selecting an int8 conv2d schedule. Previously conditions that decide which schedule to select used `is_aarch64` which checks for the existance of `aarch64` in the target triple. However, the conditions now use `has_asimd` which is true if `aarch64` exists in the target triple OR `+neon` is used in the mattr.\r\n\r\nBoth `conv2d_NHWC_quantized_interleaved.arm_cpu` and `depthwise_conv2d_nhwc.arm_cpu` makes calls to LLVM intrinsics that require both `aarch64` and `+neon`. But in the case of the target `rasp4b`, the updated conditions result in compilation failure since the target has `+neon` but doesn't have `aarch64` in the target triple. The conditions have been updated to fix the compilation failure.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the previous behaviour of the condition for `conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack.arm_cpu` has been restored ensure a program with a 32-bit target can still be compiled.\r\n\r\nFinally, we should only select the `depthwise_conv2d_nhwc_dsp.arm_cpu` schedule when a backend that understands `pragma_import_c` has been selected, i.e. \"c\".\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed discussion of the issue please see: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tflite-llvm-llvm-error-when-compiling-tflite-model/15411\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius @ashutosh-arm @ekalda

PR enables using the flash v2 kernel for offloading the attention op. Flash v2 is implemented in CUTLASS, so it is reasonable to integrate it into our CUTLASS BYOC.  \r\n\r\nThe flash v2 kernel is used whenever applicable, because it is expected to be faster than the xformer kernel. The xformer repo itself is now [admitting that flash is always faster](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers/blob/main/xformers/ops/fmha/dispatch.py#L15-L16). \r\n\r\nFor now, flash is disabled for causal attention case, since I haven't validated its correctness thoroughly. \r\n\r\nUPDATE: It seems for a single-token decoding in LLM, the flash v2 kernel with `is_causal = False` is much slower than the xformer kernel. So for LLM inference, it is recommended to always use the causal mask which will disable the flash attn kernel. The flash v2 kernel is non-trivially faster on workloads like SD. \r\n\r\n@cyx-6 @vinx13 @yzh119 @sunggg

PR is a follow up for #15322 to better support model level workload benchmarking as in https://github.com/mlc-ai/dlight-bench/pull/6\r\n\r\nintroduces some minor fixes to enable easier dynamic shape sampling for model level workload benchmarking. For example, a dynamic shape sampling function can take `sample_idx` and `sample_num` as input to generate better selection of shapes. It also makes life easier by converting all the dynamic variable to str when parsing from PrimFuncs.\r\n\r\nOther than that, this PR includes a few minor changes, including type annotation and supporting customizing the columns in the benchmarking output.","created_at":"2023-08-03T04:20:01Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:16Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4371d986bec1560533cbd6efec59ca3675296f9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/47b7bffaf5baff523fb1a182b2e82d0db6123cdb","head":{"label":"zxybazh:feature/2023-07-26/support-custom-benchmark","ref":"feature/2023-07-26/support-custom-benchmark","sha":"47b7bffaf5baff523fb1a182b2e82d0db6123cdb","user":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":337237632,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzcyMzc2MzI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"zxybazh/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh/tvm","description":"Open

incorrectly. Certificates are now created correctly\nand parsing accepts correct values as well as the previously generated\ninvalid forms with a warning. In the next release, support for parsing these\ninvalid forms will be removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v41-0-1:</p>\n<p>41.0.1 - 2023-06-01</p>\n<pre><code>\n* Temporarily allow invalid ECDSA signature algorithm parameters in X.509\n  certificates, which are generated by older versions of Java.\n* Allow null bytes in pass phrases when serializing private keys.\n<p>.. _v41-0-0:</p>\n<p>41.0.0 - 2023-05-30\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1d has been\nremoved.
