Currently, the relevant contexts are:\r\n  1) a Java application that has no access (or need to access) core\r\n  Geode code. 2) a typical Geode client application and 3) server or\r\n  locator-side code.\r\n- Introduces a service provider interface\r\n  (ClusterManagementServiceProviderFactory) whose implementations are\r\n  context dependent. This commit introduces two implementations, namely:\r\n  BasicClusterManagementProviderFactory and\r\n  SmartClusterManagementServiceProviderFactory). The latter is\r\n  incomplete but will be fully supported in the near future.\r\n- The entry point to creating a ClusterManagementService is in\r\n  ClusterManagementServiceProvider - more documentation can be found\r\n  there.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR supersedes https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3153, which has been closed.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Micrometer-based metrics system to Geode. The key elements are:\r\n- A `MeterRegistry` that maintains the set of meters for a member. The registry is configured at startup, and gives each meter it creates a set of tags that identify the member and the distributed system.\r\n- A `MemberMetricsSession` manages the configuration and lifecycle of a member's meter registry. This class implements `MetricsSession` interface, which provides methods to connect user-implemented \"downstream\" registries to publish the member registry's meters to external monitoring systems.\r\n\r\nThis intent of this limited implementation is to provide the foundation to:\r\n- Instrument Geode code using named, dimensional meters.\r\n- Experiment with a variety of existing monitoring agents that can publish Micrometer-based metrics to external monitoring systems.\r\n- Explore a variety of mechanisms for connecting external monitoring agents.\r\n\r\nSome key limitations of this implementation:\r\n- It adds no meters to Geode. It provides a *registry* to which meters can be added.\r\n- It provides a single, limited mechanism to connect external monitoring agents. This limited implementation is designed specifically to support exploring a variety of external monitoring agents.\r\n\r\nThis implementation makes the `MeterRegistry` and the `MetricsSession` available via methods on `InternalDistributedSystem`. These methods will be moved to an appropriate non-internal interface or class in the future. Likewise, `MetricsSession`, which is currently declared in an internal package, will be moved to an appropriate non-internal package in the future. `MemberMetricsSession` will remain internal.\r\n\r\nThis implementation *neither addresses nor precludes* additional mechanisms for configuring and connecting monitoring agents. We are considering several mechanisms for possible future implementation:\r\n- Supply a downstream registry at startup via a `CacheFactory`.\r\n- Supply a downstream registry at startup via a service loader.\r\n- Configure and manage a downstream registry at runtime via user-defined Geode extensions.\r\n- Other options TBD.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

The pmd rule can ignore these.\r\n- MakeImmutable - Temporary annotation to mark fields that aren't immutable but should be. For example a static final HashMap that we never change.\r\n- MakeNonStatic - Temporary annotation mark fields that are static that we are allowing to be modified at runtime. These fields should be turned into instance fields or cache.\r\n- MutableForTests - Temporary annotation to mark fields that should be immutable, but are not to allow setting them in tests.

DUnit Rule (or even a test) can now register a VMEventListener:\r\n\r\n`VM.getVMEventListenerRegistry().addVMEventListener(vmEventListener);`\r\n\r\nVMEventListeners will receive the following notifications:\r\n```\r\npublic void afterCreateVM(VM vm);\r\npublic void beforeBounceVM(VM vm);\r\npublic void afterBounceVM(VM vm);\r\n```\r\nDUnit Rules can use these callbacks in order to support\r\ndynamic creation or bouncing of VMs.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR does not complete the ticket GEODE-6033. Next step is to change the DUnit Rules to register a VMEventListener. Then the ticket will be resolved.\r\n\r\nPlease review @demery-pivotal

PR is superseded by https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3180.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Micrometer-based metrics system to Geode.\r\n\r\nOn startup, Geode configures a \"primary\" meter registry. Developers use\r\nthe primary registry to create meters (gauges, counters, timers, and\r\nothers) to instrument Geode and client code.\r\n\r\nInternally, the meter registry is a \"composite\" registry, which allows\r\nattaching any number of \"downstream\" registries. Each downstream\r\nregistry will typically publish the metrics to an external monitoring\r\nsystem, or provide an endpoint where an external monitoring system can\r\n\"scrape\" the metrics.\r\n\r\nIn Geode, when a meter is added or removed from the primary registry,\r\nthe primary registry adds or removes a corresponding meter in each\r\ndownstream registry.  When a meter in the primary registry is updated\r\n(e.g. incremented), the primary registry forwards each operation to the\r\ncorresponding meter in each downstream registry.\r\n\r\nA MetricsCollector provides access to the primary registry, and includes\r\nmethods for adding and removing downstream registries.\r\n\r\nThe MetricsCollector itself is currently available via a method on\r\nInternalDistributedSystem.  Eventually we plan to  make the\r\nMetricsCollector available through DistributedSystem, or some other\r\nnon-internal class or interface.\r\n\r\nThe key components of this change are:\r\n- MetricsCollector (interface) allows access to the primary registry,\r\n  and allows adding and removing downstream registries.\r\n- CompositeMetricsCollector is the concrete implementation of\r\n  MetricsCollector, and creates the internal composite registry.\r\n- InternalDistributedSystem creates the MetricsCollector and makes it\r\n  available via a new getMetricsCollector() method.\r\n- The Micrometer system for instrumenting and maintaining metrics (added\r\n  to Geode as a dependency). See http://micrometer.io/ for details.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Node C then left the\r\ncluster, sending a Leave message to B.  B's JoinLeave did not know about\r\nthe HealthMonitor's decision that A was crashed and did not become the\r\nnew coordinator.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes B's JoinLeave pay attention to the crashed-member set\r\nin the HealthMonitor when deciding whether to become the membership\r\ncoordinator for the cluster.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a `FunctionStreamingResultCollector` is processing (reply) messages for a transactional operation, it sometimes encounters a message that is a generic `ReplyMessage`, not a `FunctionStreamingReplyMessage`. This happens when the (remote) message processor (`PartitionMessage.process()`) attempts to perform the operation, but finds that the transaction is already closed. `process()` replies with a generic `ReplyMessage` in that case, resulting in a `ClassCastException` over in the `FunctionStreamingResultCollector`.\r\n\r\nThe solution, here, is to reply with a `TransactionException` from `process()` in this case.\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of two commits: one for the bug just described, and another (tiny one) that got the breadcrumbs facility working again. The latter was helpful in debugging the IPC.\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

* Properly wraps all scanner uses in try-with-resources blocks (to ensure temporary files are cleaned up and file descriptors are closed promptly, rather than waiting for full GC to invoke finalizers).\r\n\r\n * Limits thread usage to single thread, regardless of available CPUs or memory (this eliminates the \"multiplier effect\" where file descriptors used could be as high as 1.25 * number-of-jars * number-of-cpus).\r\n\r\n * Removes usage of a non-public classgraph API (to broaden binary compatibility with other versions of classgraph up to 4.4.12, in case anyone wants to experiment with swapping in a newer version).\r\n\r\n* Please note, classgraph 4.6.x is NOT a drop-in replacement.  Migrating to the latest version of classgraph would require some non-trivial code changes on our side.  Version up to 4.4.12 are binary-compatible, however this PR keeps the supplied version of classgraph unchanged at 4.0.6, because it was found that almost all newer versions have higher memory footprint.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

modifies auto-reconnect to lengthen the time a Locator will attempt\r\nto join from 24 seconds to 60 seconds and prevents the Locator from\r\ncreating its own cluster (which would form a split-brain).  In an\r\nauto-reconnect attempt the location service will not start up until a\r\nquorum of the old cluster can be contacted, meaning that some process\r\nthat's still in the cluster exists and should have taken over the role\r\nof membership coordinator.  The locator needs to join using that\r\ncoordinator and not create its own cluster.\r\n\r\nThis also corrects the handling of the old membership view in\r\nGMSLocator.  The restarted location service was incorrectly using this\r\nold view as an authority on who had the role of coordinator but it\r\nshould only be used as a hint.  This is done by putting the view into\r\nthe recoveredView variable and assigning it an invalid viewID.\r\n\r\nIn real applications this bug isn't likely to be encountered because the\r\nfirst auto-reconnect attempt doesn't take place for a minute.  The\r\nClusterStartupRule modifies this default to start reconnecting in 5\r\nseconds, which wasn't giving the cluster enough time to react to the\r\nloss of the old Locator and assign a new membership coordinator.\r\nWith these changes the test passes even if the default is reduced to 1\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nFinally, the test was incorrectly using internal APIs to detect whether\r\nthe Locator had successfully reconnected. I fixed some of that but\r\nopened GEODE-6312 to track the problem that stopping the old Locator did\r\nnot actually stop its cluster configuration service.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

details about lock monitors and synchronizers that the threads are holding or waiting for.\r\n\r\nI suppose we could refactor the code in `OSProcess` and `ExecutorServiceRule` that's similar, but I didn't want to go quite that far yet. For `ExecutorServiceRule`, I grouped the locked synchronizers at the top of the dump for each thread and didn't include the `Number of locked synchronizers` header.\r\n\r\nIf you run `ExecutorServiceRuleGetThreadsTest`, you can see what the dump actually looks like for various scenarios. Interesting to note that these `ThreadPoolExecutor` threads are always holding a synchronizer for its own `Worker` thread so that's why all of these show an extra `locked synchronizer`. \r\n\r\nI really wish there was a way to determine which stack frame a `Synchronizer` was locked in but it seems to be impossible in the current JDK version.\r\n\r\n`dumpThreadsContainsExecutorServiceThread`
