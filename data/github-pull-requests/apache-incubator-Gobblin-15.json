I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-836\r\nExpose container logs location via system property to be used in log4j configuration for Gobblin-on-Yarn applications\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis task exposes container log directory and container log file name via Java System properties, so that they can be referenced in log4j properties. This in turn allows configuring log rotation of container logs based on size and maximum number of back ups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested by deploying a Gobblin-on-Yarn application\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-825\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAn issue with a schema registry client caused this issue. This issue fixes the creation of new instances of the same schema for every message sent. Instead we now create an instance of the schema during object construction and use the same schema instance for all the messages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- overrideSchemaNameAndNamespaceTest in AvroUtilsTest.java\r\n- KeyValueEventObjectReporterTest.java\r\n- KeyValueMetricObjectReporterTest.java\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

STOPPING state\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-817\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHelix task cancellation can cause a workflow to be indefinitely stuck in the STOPPING state, if any of the tasks in the workflow ignores the cancel request. The Helix bug is tracked in HELIX-1933. This temporary workaround deletes the Helix workflow after a predefined time interval in the STOPPING state.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nEnd-to-end testing.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

after a timeout\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-816\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTaskDriver#getWorkflows() can hang indefinitely if there are ZK connectivity issues. This impacts the ability to cancel/restart Helix workflows running inside a Gobblin cluster. The workaround should kill the thread running getWorkflows() after a timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nEnd to end test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-814\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n  \r\n  In\r\n  gobblin-config-management/gobblin-config-client/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/config/client/package-info.java,\r\n  the class DummyClassForJavadoc is not needed anymore because other\r\n  classes have been committed into the package, as specified by the todo\r\n  comment.  The dummy class (and the comment) should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  \r\n  My PR does not need testing because the dummy class is not used anywhere, and the Javadoc of that package can be generated without the dummy class normally as there are other classes in the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-803\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n- Collection of record count metadata: Each WorkUnit contains the high watermark and low watermark for a kafka partition and that is equivalent to the number of events handled by that workunit. Given each workunit will output only single HDFS file under a path to be registered, we maintained a map(`pathToRecordCount`) from to-register path to the number of records it contains.  \r\n- Whenever a `HiveSpec` is logically representing a partition (`spec.getPartition.isPresent` equals to `true`), it will be updated with record count information collected in the map `pathToRecordCount` before handed over to `hiveRegister`. \r\n- Add a unit test to examine correctness of record counting. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

the metric context cache from GobblinMetricsRegistry\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-800\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   1) Create the ForkMetrics that can be used by Fork constrct when creating the metric context.\r\n   2) Add the clean up logic in the GobblinMultiTaskAttempt to remove the metrics context hold by GobblinMetricsRegistry.\r\n   3) Fix the Nullpointer exception due to an uninitialized taskAttemptId field inside of the TaskState deserialization.\r\n   4) Some string replacement (refactoring) for GobblinMetrics.\r\n   5) Add the metrics cleanup validation in ClusterIntegrationTest\r\n   6) Add the creatorTag inside JobMetrics. The removal can first check if the JobMetircs was created by the real creator; otherwise it just ignore the removal operation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   Rerun ClusterIntegrationTest\r\n   Rerun MRJobLauncher test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-798\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf the application master aborts a new one may be spawned by YARN. The second application master will resubmit the jobs. This results in duplicate jobs in Helix and multiple instances of the job may run, resulting in duplicate data.\r\n\r\nThe Gobblin application master should clean up all workflows on startup to avoid executing multiple instances of a job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGobblinYarnAppLauncherTest.testJobCleanup()\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-795\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nExisting behavior enforces the need to provide a JobCatalog. We relax this requirement and allow the JobConfigurationManager to bootstrap the gobblin cluster with job configs from a configured location (as opposed to bootstrapping from a JobCatalog). \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests in JobConfigurationManagerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-791\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe asynchronous task execution model uses ReactiveX streams with a ConnectableFlowable. This is  a hot flowable, so it does not terminate when all subscribers have exited. This results in the extractor continuing to emit records after downstream constructs have exited due to an error. This is very problematic for extractors that introduce waits on control message acks since the extractor may hang.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the errors do not propagate upwards, so errors in the writer do not fail the fork. Change the state of the fork onCancel() to a failure state so that the task gets failed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTaskContinuousTest.testContinuousTaskError()\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-790\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis is the implementation of `DagStateStore` backed by MySQL. \r\nInstead of implementing its own MySQLl-related logic, it instantiate a `MySQLStateStore` inside the DagStateStore and delegate all interactions between MySQL to that. To archive this, also added: \r\n- Conversion from `Dag` to `State` by having `Dag` serialized first and put it as a value in State's k-v pair. \r\n- `getAll` method in `MysqlStateStore` where it used to strictly require `storeName` to show up. \r\n- Model the schema of `MysqlStateStore`  in the `Dag'gy way: `FlowId` <--> `storeName`,  `FlowExecutionId` <--> `tableName`. \r\n- Refactor some of test methods to reduce code redundancy. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Relevant unit tests are added. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

This allows cancelling Gobblin jobs running on a Gobblin Helix cluster using a Spec containing the job name, instead of requiring the spec to provide the Helix Workflow Id.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nClusterIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-787\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn some cases a task may be scheduled to run on multiple workers. One case where this happens is when running with the Helix task execution framework. Helix may reschedule a task on a different worker if it loses contact with a worker. That worker may continue executing for some time before the task is terminated. During this period if the output file names collide then there may be an error during data publish.\r\n\r\nAdd an option \"writer.addTaskTimestamp\" that can be used to reduce the chance of name collisions by appending a task startup timestamp to the file name.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nLocalJobLauncherTest.testLaunchJobWithTaskTimestamps()\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nA little bit background on this PR: \r\nIn Gobblin-as-a-Service deployment, there are extreme cases that the whole data center where a GaaS cluster is deployed went down. In that case we will launch another GaaS cluster to handle request-serving and orchestration. To guarantee a valid working state for DR-Nominated GaaS Cluster, we will need to clean certain left-over states.  Also, not all `FlowSpec`s would be eligible for running in alternative environment due to data affinity or so. So we provide `SpecStore` an ability to tag certain `FlowSpec`s and only those will be picked up by DR-Nominated cluster to work on. \r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-781\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly solving problems mentioned in background sections by: \r\n- Adding \"tag\" into `MysqlSpecStore`. \r\n- Adding `isNominatedDRHanlder ` as a configuration for newly-launched GaaS master node.\r\n- Adding logic inside `scheduleSpecsFromCatalog`  to pick up tagged `FlowSpec`s in DR-nominated node. This is just a skeleton code for now since the real cancellation features is not yet there. \r\n- Fixing some of API in `SpecStore` and deprecated the old method load all `Spec`s into memory. \r\n- Some changes in `GobblinServiceManager` to get rid of left-over during prototyping phase.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   - Unit test for loading `spec`s with tag. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

be stuck\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-780\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIssue 1: The YarnAutoScalingRunnable is run in a fixed schedule by a ScheduledExecutorService in YarnAutoScalingManager. If the runnable encounters an exception the the executor service will stop scheduling it. Catch all exceptions in the runnable, log, and do not re-raise.\r\n\r\nIssue 2: The auto scaler may reduce the container count to 0. Helix will not schedule any flows if there are no participants connected. This results in the auto scaler keeping the container count at 0 and no progress is made. Fix this by not allowing the container count to be reduced below 1.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-778\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSalesforceExtractor uses bulk connection to connect to Salesforce using bulk API. Since bulkConnection is private variable it cannot be modified to pass custom transportFactory via config.\r\nThis task is to separate the config creation from bulkApiLogin method so as it can be overridden for passing custom params like setTransport.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo new code added, this change only refactors the code into a separate method.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-774\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFork will raise an error without ack/nacking if the control message handler raises an error. This can result in another thread waiting indefinitely for a control message ack. Fork.\r\n\r\nconsumeRecordStream() should handle control message exceptions by calling nack() with the exception before reraising the error.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-772\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe need a schema comparison strategy to make sure the real schema and the expected schema have compatibility.\r\n- Add an interface of schema check strategy.\r\n- Add configuration using which user can specify the schema check strategy\r\n- Add default schema check strategy. The default schema check strategy will check if the two schemas have matching field names and types.\r\n- The file org.apache.gobblin.restli.throttling.permits.snapshot.json changed because the file gobblin-github/gobblin-restli/gobblin-throttling-service/gobblin-throttling-service-api/src/main/pegasus/org/apache/gobblin/restli/throttling/PermitAllocation.pdsc changed in ticket[GOBBLIN-724]. And after a full build, this change will automatically shows up.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Unit test: Make the real schema and expected schema have different name or type and make sure the method return false. And make they have matching name and type but not the same doc and make sure the method return true.\r\n- Integration test: Run end to end test on Hadoop to make sure the SchemaCheckedCopySource works well with the strategy.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-770\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe current code sets Xmx to the value of the YARN container memory limit. The JVM is highly likely to hit the container memory limit with this configuration due to overhead costs that are not in the JVM heap.\r\n\r\nConfiguration should be added to set JVM memory as a percentage of the container memory minus a configurable overhead.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

in last n days\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-759] My Added feature to support DistCP to copy files modified in last n days\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-759\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Added feature to DistCP the files which were modified in last n days within the lookback period.\r\n2. This feature allows to copy only the modified files even when non modified files not at the destination.\r\n3. Leverage existing TimestampBasedCopyableDataset to find the dataset and uses SelectBtwModDataTimeBasedCopyableFileFilter CopyableFilter implementation to filter the files that were modified in last n days.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. Added TimestampBasedCopyableDatasetTest.testCopyWithFilter test case to test 1 modified and 1 non-modified scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-769\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n- Currently, if a record timestamp is a string, `TimeBasedAvroWriterPartitioner` will not be able to recognize it and will use current time. This change will try to convert a string to Long before using current time\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n- `TimeBasedAvroWriterPartitioner.testGetRecordTimestamp` covers various cases for reading string record timestamp\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-767\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR: \r\n- Currently, `TimeBasedWriterPartitioner` assumes the timestamp value from a record is in millis. The task is to remove the assumption and support timestamp in different units, by default, in millis.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n- `TimeBasedAvroWriterPartitionerTest.testWriter` tests writing with default unit and in seconds\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-762\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdded `YarnAutoScalingManager` which can be started by the `GobblinApplicationMaster` by setting the `gobblin.yarn.app.master.serviceClasses` configuration. This class runs a scheduled task with a default interval of 60 seconds to detect the number of required partitions for the workflows submitted to Helix. It will request the `YarnService` to scale to a computed number of containers. If the requested number of containers is higher than the YarnService has previously requested then it will request more containers. If the requested count is less than the current number of allocated containers then it will free any unused containers.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nYarnAutoScalingManagerTest and YarnServiceTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-759] My Added feature to support DistCP to copy files modified in last n days\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-759\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Added feature to DistCP the files which were modified in last n days within the lookback period.\r\n2. This feature allows to copy only the modified files even when non modified files not at the destination.\r\n3. Leverage existing TimestampBasedCopyableDataset to find the dataset and uses SelectBtwModDataTimeBasedCopyableFileFilter CopyableFilter implementation to filter the files that were modified in last n days.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. Added TimestampBasedCopyableDatasetTest.testCopyWithFilter test case to test 1 modified and 1 non-modified scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-27T21:19:32Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T00:36:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T00:36:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69fcdd1e3d196c271e6c977651a73ffa5a203668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6e579e799413b4d1b494f610d65a5485e96dbfd4","head":{"label":"amarnathkarthik:master","ref":"master","sha":"6e579e799413b4d1b494f610d65a5485e96dbfd4","user":{"login":"amarnathkarthik","id":15644972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ0OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15644972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik","html_url":"https://github.com/amarnathkarthik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amarnathkarthik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f029b4c0fea0fe4aa62f36dda2512344ff708bae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nEssentially a bunch of renaming, moving configurations key around. \r\nThings that we should agree on: \r\n- Configuration keys should always placed in the class where they are relevant, instead of `ConfigurationKeys.java` or similar things. We should definitely stop doing that. \r\n- Naming of `FSFlowCatalog` is misleading. In fact it should be `FsTemplateFlowCatalog`. Also, it should not extend `FsJobCatalog`. The missing piece is a `FsCatalogBase`  that implement all FileSystem related basic functionality, and have `Template` and `Job` FsCatalog extending that base implementation with it own interface. \r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA]\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-748\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-744\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis task supports the ability to interrupt and cancel a running job on a Gobblin Helix cluster via a DELETE Spec submitted to the JobConfigurationManager. The DELETE Spec should have \"gobblin.cluster.shouldCancelRunningJobOnDelete\" set to true for cancelling a running job. The default behavior is to simply delete the corresponding JobSpec from the JobCatalog. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIntegrationJobCancelViaSpecSuite and ClusterIntegrationTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-742\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis task aims to implement a FileSystem based JobConfigurationManager. The manager has an underlying SpecConsumer which reads specs from a config specified path on HDFS and persists them to a JobCatalog. On successful consumption of the spec by the manager , it is deleted from the original path.  So on the next fetch, only new specs will be picked up by the JobConfigurationManager.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nFsScheduledJobConfigurationManagerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

on YARN\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-739\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe AzkabanGobblinYarnAppLauncher can be used to launch a Gobblin application master on YARN, which then loads configuration from an application.conf file. Currently, the application.conf is pre-generated and packaged with the Azkaban job zip. This results in duplication of config between the Azkaban job properties and the application.conf file. It also doesn't allow user overrides in the Azkaban UI to be propagated to the app master and containers.\r\n\r\nA config (gobblin.yarn.akabanConfigOutputPath) is added to specify an output path to write the Azkaban job config to in HOCON format. The gobblin yarn config such as gobblin.yarn.app.master.files.local and gobblin.yarn.container.files.local can be set to point to the output file.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-737\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSupport configuring Helix quota-based task scheduling through gobblin cluster configuration. The gobblin cluster config key \"gobblin.cluster.helixTaskQuotaConfig\" is added to store a value in the format \"quota_type1:quota_value1,quota_type2:quota_value2,...\". The config values are parsed and propagated to the Helix cluster configuration.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGobblinClusterManagerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

in the CloseOnFlushWriterWrapper\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-736\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe CloseOnFlushWriterWrapper calls operations on the underlying handler to handle flush and metadata update control messages. These operations should not be done on a closed writer since the underlying writer may raise errors for closed objects. Added early returns when a closed writer is detected.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded test cases to CloseOnFlushWriterWrapperTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-732\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAzkaban generates hadoop tokens and secrets in the HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION file. If this is present the propagate the credentials to the application master and workers. Also load the dynamic configuration in the workers if configured.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan an Azkaban workflow to validate. The yarn integration test is not functional and the config propagation can't be tested with a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not
