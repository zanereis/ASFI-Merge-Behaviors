Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1806\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix flaky TestClusterAggregateMetrics by wrapping maintenance mode around batch enabling of instances, otherwise the events may be processed separately, resulting in an intermediate best possible state that does not represent the final state. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1833\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is no existing metrics about Task Framework available threads. Certain production issues are caused by simple reasons such as out of threads, and in order to spot those reasons, developers have to spend time reading through logs. \r\n\r\nWith metrics for available threads, grouped by job types and aggregated on the cluster level, it's now easy for developers to find the thread availability of any cluster. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestClusterStatusMonitor.testRecordAvailableThreadsPerType\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #1821  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nTestInstancesAccessor is unstable because the cluster might not be stable while the test runs the stoppable check and cluster config and instance config can be missing. In this commit, the test waits until the cluster config and instance config get created and then proceeds for the stoppable checks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nHelix-rest:\r\n```[INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 127.842 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/anajari/my_repos/helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 79 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:16 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-07-21T19:46:04-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1768\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe premise of TestZkConnectionLost is to test for the scenario of spotty ZK connection, and whether the connection retry delay is able to help Helix proceed.\r\n\r\nThe ZK server is shutdown repeatedly and restarted after 300ms. The connection retry delay was originally set at 1000ms. Based on local observation, it seems that the 1000ms delay is more than enough to wait until ZK server is restarted again, and the test failure is unable to be reproduced. In an effort to keep the test stable, the delay is increased to 5000ms. \r\n\r\nIn the process, 2 unrelated errors are spotted with this test case: 1. the test is checking the wrong zk address for live instances, 2. the test is not asserting the check result. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nNote: the test class is run for 20 times with consistent passing. \r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 441.106 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestZkConnectionLost\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1822\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe development of cluster freeze mode in a feature branch cluster-pause-mode is completed. We will merge it to the master branch. 13 commits in total.\r\n\r\nCluster freeze mode enables Helix to temporarily step down from managing the cluster, while still retaining the cluster state to recover after the existing controller pause mode. It is achieved by pausing Helix controller to not send new state transitions, and freezing Helix participant cluster to preserve the current state. Helix makes it automated and generic to minimize human resources, reduce service downtime and impact for the end users.\r\n\r\nThe feature is tested in a prod like environment. It works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRunning one more time full tests in helix-core, helix-rest\r\n\r\nhelix-rest\r\n```\r\n12:31:55,557 [INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 97.07 s - in TestSuite\r\n12:31:56,013 [INFO]\r\n12:31:56,013 [INFO] Results:\r\n12:31:56,014 [INFO]\r\n12:31:56,014 [INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n12:31:56,014 [INFO]\r\n12:31:56,457 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n12:31:56,457 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n12:31:56,457 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n12:31:56,459 [INFO] Total time:  01:41 min\r\n12:31:56,459 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-07-16T12:31:56-07:00\r\n12:31:56,459 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n20:22:08,180 [INFO] Tests run: 1282, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,975.911 s - in TestSuite\r\n20:22:08,707 [INFO]\r\n20:22:08,707 [INFO] Results:\r\n20:22:08,707 [INFO]\r\n20:22:08,707 [INFO] Tests run: 1282, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n20:22:08,707 [INFO]\r\n20:22:08,711 [INFO]\r\n20:22:08,711 [INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n20:22:08,742 [INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulu/Projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n20:22:09,215 [INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 911 classes\r\n20:22:10,713 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n20:22:10,714 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n20:22:10,714 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n20:22:10,715 [INFO] Total time:  01:23 h\r\n20:22:10,715 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-07-15T20:22:10-07:00\r\n20:22:10,716 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSecond time\r\n\r\n14:00:37,253 [INFO] Tests run: 1282, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,928.497 s - in TestSuite\r\n14:00:37,757 [INFO]\r\n14:00:37,757 [INFO] Results:\r\n14:00:37,757 [INFO]\r\n14:00:37,757 [INFO] Tests run: 1282, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n14:00:37,758 [INFO]\r\n14:00:37,761 [INFO]\r\n14:00:37,762 [INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n14:00:37,794 [INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulu/Projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n14:00:38,270 [INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 911 classes\r\n14:00:39,803 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n14:00:39,804 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n14:00:39,805 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n14:00:39,807 [INFO] Total time:  01:22 h\r\n14:00:39,809 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-07-16T14:00:39-07:00\r\n14:00:39,809 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1811\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAfter controller sends a freeze message to participant, participant needs to process the freeze message and execute the freeze request. It will mark the live instance as \"frozen\" internally in memory and in live instance znode.\r\n\r\nFor session change during freeze, handle new session won't do anything, except creating the live instance znode.\r\nTo unfreeze, if there is session change during the freeze period, state model state will be synced and current states will be carried over. Then live instance status field is removed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n ```\r\ntestFreezeParticipant\r\ntestHandleNewSessionWhenFrozen\r\ntestNormalLiveInstanceStatus\r\ntestRestartParticipantWhenFrozen\r\ntestUnfreezeParticipant\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n17:28:47,647 [INFO] Tests run: 1275, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,026.107 s - in TestSuite\r\n17:28:48,163 [INFO]\r\n17:28:48,163 [INFO] Results:\r\n17:28:48,163 [INFO]\r\n17:28:48,163 [INFO] Tests run: 1275, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n17:28:48,163 [INFO]\r\n17:28:48,167 [INFO]\r\n17:28:48,167 [INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n17:28:48,200 [INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulu/Projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n17:28:48,686 [INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 911 classes\r\n17:28:50,307 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n17:28:50,307 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n17:28:50,308 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n17:28:50,309 [INFO] Total time:  01:23 h\r\n17:28:50,309 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-07-13T17:28:50-07:00\r\n17:28:50,309 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1774 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn cluster freeze mode, controller sends freeze/unfreeze and pending ST cancellation messages to participants.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the existing message generation stage is leveraged to create the ST cancellation messages. Best possible out is built by copying the state map from current state for generating cancellation messages. For freeze/unfreeze messages, the logic is added in `ManagementMessageGenerationPhase`. The existing `MessageDispatchStage` is also used for dispatching all the messages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestManagementMessageGeneration\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n22:24:55,835 [INFO] Tests run: 1271, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,946.388 s - in TestSuite\r\n22:24:56,378 [INFO]\r\n22:24:56,378 [INFO] Results:\r\n22:24:56,378 [INFO]\r\n22:24:56,378 [INFO] Tests run: 1271, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n22:24:56,378 [INFO]\r\n22:24:56,382 [INFO]\r\n22:24:56,382 [INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n22:24:56,417 [INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulu/Projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n22:24:56,883 [INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 908 classes\r\n22:24:58,418 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n22:24:58,418 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n22:24:58,419 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n22:24:58,420 [INFO] Total time:  01:22 h\r\n22:24:58,420 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-06-28T22:24:58-07:00\r\n22:24:58,420 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWith management mode pipeline, the pause and maintenance signals handling logic should be moved out of the onControllerChange() and moved to the management mode pipeline. \r\n\r\nThis PR handles pause/maintenance signals enable/disable and update cluster status accordingly. The whole logic of pause mode will be handled in the other following PRs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe existing maintenance mode tests should cover the logic for maintenance. Tests for freeze mode will be added later.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nTests passed\r\n\r\n```\r\n22:10:54,749 [INFO] Results:\r\n22:10:54,749 [INFO]\r\n22:10:54,749 [ERROR] Failures:\r\n22:10:54,749 [ERROR]   TestZeroReplicaAvoidance.testDelayedRebalancer:141 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n22:10:54,750 [ERROR]   TestZeroReplicaAvoidance.testWagedRebalancer:182 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n22:10:54,750 [INFO]\r\n22:10:54,750 [ERROR] Tests run: 1271, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n22:10:54,750 [INFO]\r\n22:10:54,755 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n22:10:54,755 [INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n22:10:54,755 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n22:10:54,756 [INFO] Total time:  01:22 h\r\n22:10:54,757 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-06-10T22:10:54-07:00\r\n22:10:54,757 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n23:14:50,230 [INFO] Tests run: 20, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 30.411 s - in TestSuite\r\n23:14:50,610 [INFO]\r\n23:14:50,611 [INFO] Results:\r\n23:14:50,611 [INFO]\r\n23:14:50,611 [INFO] Tests run: 20, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n23:14:50,612 [INFO]\r\n23:14:50,616 [INFO]\r\n23:14:50,616 [INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n23:14:50,649 [INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulu/Projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n23:14:51,132 [INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 906 classes\r\n23:14:52,692 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n23:14:52,692 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n23:14:52,692 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n23:14:52,694 [INFO] Total time:  36.665 s\r\n23:14:52,694 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-06-10T23:14:52-07:00\r\n23:14:52,694 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

the partition status colors in Helix UI from green/orange to blue(#2196F3)/black(#212121) to be more colorblind- friendly. The colors are chosen such that they have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against each other and the background. Moreover, a checkmark is placed in the icon for ready status, and an exclamation point for the not-ready status. Screenshots of the changes are the following:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-06-07 at 10 26 35 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67170754/121063197-da757380-c77a-11eb-9b5c-472caafd5317.png) ![Screen Shot 2021-06-07 at 10 28 21 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67170754/121063394-17da0100-c77b-11eb-90b3-70de6e5ec9f1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1763 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to address the problem that the interrupt signal is swallowed by the catch logic so the thread is not really interrupted. This may cause leakage or race conditions.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew test TestAsyncBaseStage has been added to verify that AbstractAsyncBaseStage in the async thread can be canceled correctly.\r\nThe other changes are already covered by the existing tests to prove that they won't fail the normal logic.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nThis PR will partially fix unstable tests like #1763 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the non-official ZK error codes that are returned in Helix ZkClient. The original design was made for differentiating the failure cases. However, that design causes unexpected NPE since most of Helix's logic relies on the Zookeeper KeeperException class to identify the error types.\r\n\r\nFYI,\r\n```\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7121680Z 1810401 [ExternalViewComputeWorker-TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle0_2] ERROR org.apache.helix.controller.pipeline.AbstractAsyncBaseStage  - Failed to process DEFAULT::ExternalViewComputeStage asynchronously\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7127825Z java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7130637Z \tat org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZkBaseDataAccessor.set(ZkBaseDataAccessor.java:912)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7135009Z \tat org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZkBaseDataAccessor.setChildren(ZkBaseDataAccessor.java:856)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7140459Z \tat org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKHelixDataAccessor.setChildren(ZKHelixDataAccessor.java:578)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7146249Z \tat org.apache.helix.controller.stages.ExternalViewComputeStage.execute(ExternalViewComputeStage.java:134)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7149517Z \tat org.apache.helix.controller.pipeline.AbstractAsyncBaseStage$1.run(AbstractAsyncBaseStage.java:47)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7152294Z \tat org.apache.helix.controller.GenericHelixController$3.handleEvent(GenericHelixController.java:701)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7154919Z \tat org.apache.helix.controller.GenericHelixController$3.handleEvent(GenericHelixController.java:697)\r\n2021-05-27T13:44:01.7157110Z \tat org.apache.helix.common.DedupEventProcessor.run(DedupEventProcessor.java:61)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne option is to change all the logic that reads KeeperException. It would cause a huge change and potentially diverge Helix from the official Zookeeper release. So it would eventually make the whole ZK error processing logics harder to maintain.\r\n\r\nHere, I proposed to convert back to the official ZK error code. Given the current processing logic does not need a different customized code to branch, I don't see any necessity of having these additional error codes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nRelated tests have been modified.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1772 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #1769 . Please review #1769 first.\r\n\r\nWith management mode pipeline, the pause and maintenance signals handling logic should be moved out of the onControllerChange() and moved to the management mode pipeline. Controller reacts to pause/maintenance signal events:\r\n- cluster status monitor needs to update cluster status\r\n- trigger resume event to do a default rebalance after exiting the mode. \r\n\r\nSo we need to handle the signals, update cluster status and trigger default rebalance in management mode pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis PR handles maintenance mode signal in the management pipeline: check if the cluster is in maintenance mode and should resume normal rebalance pipeline. The whole logic of pause mode will be handled in the other following PRs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1766 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nManagement Mode Pipeline Registry will help check the cluster status and determine whether the default pipelines can be run.\r\nThe use case is, it will help controller to decide when it can exit the cluster freeze mode.\r\n\r\nThe overall logic is, for each onControllerChange event, it will enter the management mode pipeline. The management mode pipeline will check if it is entering or existing cluster freeze/maintenance/controller pause mode. And the pipeline will check the required status. After the cluster exits controller pause or maintenance mode, the management mode pipeline will trigger a resume event to switch to the default pipeline.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the default pipeline, if any abnormal instances are found in the ResourceValidationStage, it will exit the pipeline and force switching to the management mode pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

online/offline status colors in Helix UI from green/red to blue(#2196F3)/black(#212121) to be colorblind-friendly. The colors are chosen such that they have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against each other and the background. Moreover, a checkmark is placed in the icon for online status, and a cross (x) for the offline. Screenshots of the changes are the following:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-26 at 1 16 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67170754/119725394-bcc41800-be24-11eb-92ed-5c6bb6ba58e9.png) ![Screen Shot 2021-05-26 at 1 16 22 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67170754/119725398-bd5cae80-be24-11eb-9882-155d11204c72.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to address the missing feature in the Helix automated CI process. No logic changes. So we are not using the PR template since most of the required fields are not relevant.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T17:22:37Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T21:06:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T20:34:33Z","merged_at":"2021-05-26T20:34:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b0d085fd039be4f096afdd79cf50e1b1e61e3d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/5c0c04b1992d1587320179f6b230fcd44d13d03d","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:ciReport","ref":"ciReport","sha":"5c0c04b1992d1587320179f6b230fcd44d13d03d","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1755 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nReadOnlyWagedRebalancer should not require a was Zk address in constructor.\r\nIn a multi ZK scenario, the address might be a mock address or a fake one. Passing a raw ZK address does not make sense.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nThis API will be called by a REST API added in PR #1747. Unit test added in that PR will cover this change. \r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T03:45:28Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T17:56:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T18:46:18Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T18:46:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"c93a7e33604fbb2efeb013986fb6a6411d841ad2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/059fc80a2157aaa8e56256f56a146412b8e0e6a5","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:readOnlyWaged","ref":"readOnlyWaged","sha":"059fc80a2157aaa8e56256f56a146412b8e0e6a5","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1752\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a potential NPE Exception that may be thrown in the DistClusterControllerStateModel state transition methods.\r\nWhen this error happens, a follower to leader state transition might be interrupted. The controller instance partition will be set with the ERROR state but the controller instance may have connected to the Zookeeper already. This causes inconsistency and leakage since the controller instance won't be properly cleaned up when it is dropped directly from ERROR state.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe original issue is hard to test. Especially with the fix, it is not possible to reproduce the NPE problem anymore.\r\nI suggest we mainly rely on the TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle to validate the correctness. It should become very stable after this change.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to avoid a potential deadlock that happens in a race condition when shutting down RoutingTableProvider.\r\n\r\nThe race condition happens when the RoutingTableProvider is shut down and the corresponding HelixManager is processing an onLiveInstanceChange event. Both threads require 2 locks, HelixManager lock, and RoutingTableProvider._lastSeenSessions, in different orders.\r\nTo resolve this problem, this PR changes 2 logic.\r\n1. Remove the _lastSeenSessions lock usage. So no more deadlock. The logic correctness is now ensured by the AtomicReference.getAndSet method.\r\n2. Remove LiveInstanceChangeListener in the shutdown call before processing the other logic. This is a missing logic and should be done regardless of the deadlock problem. Moreover, this change also avoids a more complicated race condition introduced by the previous change that may lead to CurrentStates callback handler leakage.\r\n\r\nTest cases in TestZkCallbackHandlerLeak have been updated to validate the logic changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkCallbackHandlerLeak\r\n\r\nI run the test over the weekend, passed continuously 3533 times already.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixed #1481 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR used the `SlidingTimeWindowReservoir` to replace the default `ExponentiallyDecayingReservoir` so that we can define the sliding window size for our metrics in Helix-rest. Currently the sliding window is set to 1 min.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1743 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor cluster pause mode feature: controller needs to listen to the pause signal change and resume the cluster from pause mode upon pause signal change.\r\n\r\nThis PR does implements following:\r\n- Add ClusterPauseChangeListener in HelixManager, watching pause data change for exiting cluster pause\r\n- Implements pause signal data change callback to notify controller\r\n- Selectively update cache for pause signal\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n - `testClusterPauseSignalUpdate`\r\n - add logic to check pause change notification in `testPauseSignal`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

session will be removed in the TaskCurrentState path. \r\n\r\nThis is normally acceptable because both CurrentStates are created by the same session, however, under certain unusual circumstances, this may not behave correctly. For example, after creating a TaskCurrentState, if a user changes Helix versions to a version before TaskCurrentState is introduced, then the clean up logic will only clean up regular CurrentState and leave the TaskCurrentState - this leaves a TaskCurrentState session that doesn't exist on CurrentState side, which will never be cleaned up using the current logic. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestHandleSession.testRemoveOldSession\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1729 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`getAssignmentForWagedFullAutoImpl` doesn't correctly assign a snapshot to the read-only rebalancer before applying the parameters as a new snapshot. That means when the Waged rebalancer compares snapshots, it always treats every bit of metadata from the parameters as new metadata since the old snapshot is missing, therefore it always triggers a complete global rebalance as if the cluster is newly created. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the intended behavior. The intended behavior is that `getAssignmentForWagedFullAutoImpl` acts as a simulation -  the parameters are as if applied without actually applying them, and the Waged rebalancer reaction can be observed. To correctly simulate, the read-only rebalancer must have an old snapshot that aligns with the current metadata of the cluster, so it can react to metadata changes properly - for example, if the difference between current metadata and the parameters only contains 1 ResourceConfig change, the global rebalance should only affect that resource. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,250.877 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testLostZkConnection(org.apache.helix.integration.TestZkConnectionLost)  Time elapsed: 127.742 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Workflow testLostZkConnection_20210508T023618 context is empty or not in states: [COMPLETED], current state: IN_PROGRESS.\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection(TestZkConnectionLost.java:174)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection:174 » Helix Workflow testLostZkConne...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:27 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-05-07T20:00:29-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 79.922 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestZkConnectionLost\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/nesun/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 890 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:30 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-05-10T11:11:38-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1725\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere were 2 issues that block the build.\r\n1. The project is referring to mvnrepository.com for the restlet package. Which is not the official repo and might be changed and cause a build failure.\r\n2. restlet.org is now redirected automatically to restlet.talend.com. Since the redirection is not always stable, like now I guess it fails, we need to change the URL accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jiajunwang/helix/actions/runs/821296921\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#1675 Remove requested state update in task framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe can prevent over write by checking the in memory state _stateModel and update ZK conditionally in message handling. Also the in memory state _stateModel update (in both task Runner thread and state transition handling thread), comparing and ZK update need to be protected by a lock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-04T20:28:27Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T17:56:27Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T17:34:04Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T17:34:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbb0554f696a77f04f5f15adbd148b5f6bbe172f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a9c7e7c3b5e747038632ea53ad3f5ad683ef085a","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:task_requestedState","ref":"task_requestedState","sha":"a9c7e7c3b5e747038632ea53ad3f5ad683ef085a","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nclose #1720 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis logic is causing confusion when the partitions are disabled unexpected.\r\nIn reality, if the partition fails to finish a state-transition from the ERROR state, it will remain in the ERROR state. And disabling it, in addition, is not desired.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThere is no additional logic added. I also removed the test case which checks if the partition is disabled on such a failure.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-30T19:47:36Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T22:17:46Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T22:17:46Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T22:17:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"bee860a8b8d2a9594e15b8e37de37fbb2e22b612","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/4407cab726508423f936168775b1233772031d74","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:master","ref":"master","sha":"4407cab726508423f936168775b1233772031d74","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

This PR defines an additional return code for the ZK session mismatch situation and by checking for this condition in the needRetry() method, provides a more meaningful message in the log.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestExpandCluster.testClusterExpansion:61 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:56 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-04-28T09:57:01-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nTestExpandCluster:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 94.638 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/rabashiz/IdeaProjects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 890 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:41 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-04-28T10:01:06-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 54, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ zookeeper-api ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/rabashiz/IdeaProjects/helix/zookeeper-api/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: ZooKeeper API' with 115 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  09:18 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-04-28T10:16:51-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1634 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the unstable test TestResourceChangeDetector by avoiding unexpected metadata input changes.\r\n\r\nBasically, the change eliminates the cache refresh so metadata will not be updated for sure. This helps to prevent test failure on any transient cluster changes during the test. And since cache refresh is not this test case is trying to cover, it is OK to remove it. The other test cases have covered the detector's reactions on cache refresh event.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nPure test fixes. Run it locally more than 30 times and it all passes now.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-23T21:27:19Z","updated_at":"2021-04-23T23:13:35Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T23:13:35Z","merged_at":"2021-04-23T23:13:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"541d093c2f65f0b0ad1f0d30be2783bf55ba0562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/376947a7dc2f8061309e67c44e6938419de105c3","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:master","ref":"master","sha":"376947a7dc2f8061309e67c44e6938419de105c3","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nresolve #343 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe first step for per replica level throttling is supporting logic to determine what message is recovery/rebalance or load rebalance.\r\nThree functions added: 1) rebalance type computation required state.\r\n                                        2) rebalance type per message\r\n                                        3) message sorting rules and comparators to determine which message to apply first.\r\n\r\nFor global change contexts please refer: https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1713\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nSplit PRs. The branch will not able to compile or test until finishes code change.\r\nWill have tests files and testing result in last several PRs.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1700 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen WAGED encounters a \"FAILED_TO_CALCULATE\" exception, the exception is processed by the pipeline without propagating. This is by design because WAGED doesn't consider this exception as pipeline breaking - WAGED simply returns the last known good result instead and continue the pipeline. \r\n\r\nWAGED simulation API calls the pipelines to get a simulated rebalance result, and as a result, it also cannot reflect \"FAILED_TO_CALCULATE\" except for an error log. \r\n\r\nDown the line, we would like the simulation API to be used to forecast potential calculation failure: when a customer makes partition weight changes, for example, they can first use the API to see the aftermath of such change, and don't do the changes if they can result calculation failures. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we need the simulation API to have the ability to propagate \"FAILED_TO_CALCULATE\" exception. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTestWagedRebalancer.testAlgorithmException is modified. \r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,170.788 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/nesun/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 890 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:26 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-05-04T15:07:24-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

backward compatibility. They are encouraged to include these changes in the commit description so that other developers can be easily aware of them. \r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the fact that feature branches may not be updated by non-backward-compatible changes applied to the master branch.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1661 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix unexpected results when resuming a cluster from paused/maintenance mode.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a race condition that the resume event could be pushed to the event queue before the cluster status has been updated. In this case, when the event is processed, the controller might still think the cluster is in paused/maintenance mode. As a result, the resume event is discarded and the rebalance won't be done until the next event happens.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nA new test for the race condition is not easy unless we add some stubs for the test only. That will potentially slow the pipeline or introduce confusion. So I suggest that we rely on the existing test to ensure the changes are good. This logic is called in almost all the integration test, so if it has any regression, we shall see many failures.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have repeatedly run TestCleanupExternalView more than **295** times. And it works fine.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T20:05:37Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T17:59:31Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T17:59:30Z","merged_at":"2021-04-20T17:59:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5414f86a44f2cdfc5cac2cbaa48f7ca2b5703ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7f5219b63a97e97d6ec75b4e413a4c50d77b4661","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:master","ref":"master","sha":"7f5219b63a97e97d6ec75b4e413a4c50d77b4661","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolve #1670 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve the undesired dependencies between DifferenceWithIdealStateGauge metric and the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT configuration. Before the change, if the assignment is not persisted, then the metric will report incorrect data.\r\nTo fix the issue, the calculation must be moved from the ExternalViewComputeStage to the BestPossibleStateCalcStage. Because the Best Possible State is only available in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage assuming the PERSIST_XXXXXX_ASSIGNMENT option is not turned on. In addition to the main logic migration, other changes listed following are required to ensure multi-thread safety.\r\n1. Concurrent control of the EV cache since it will now be read in the BestPossibleStateCalcStage in addition to the ExternalViewComputeStage.\r\n2. Minor changes in the diff computing logic for the corner cases since the Best Possible State state mapping is not exactly the same as IdealState persist assignment.\r\n3. Cleanup PersistAssignmentStage logic so it won't modify the IdealState cache anymore. It is supposed to be read-only.\r\n4. Test cases are modified to cover the changes. Also, the metric is now reporting correct results in some corner cases such as all the nodes are disabled. The test cases which are testing based on the wrong behavior have been fixed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModify TestClusterAggregateMetrics.java according to the new behavior.\r\nAdding new checks in TestClusterStatusMonitor.java to validate the DifferenceWithIdealStateGauge result.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1264, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,080.412 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1264, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:24 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-04-13T20:15:05-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote that TestCleanupExternalView is not stable currently. It frequently fails in the master branch too. We will take care of that separately.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-13T05:37:32Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T00:52:20Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T00:52:20Z","merged_at":"2021-04-15T00:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"5eae4451c3cd658b6e607fd9864a62fc2482d47a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d292026e26e5098bc751eca2e2e3c29191dadf68","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:master","ref":"master","sha":"d292026e26e5098bc751eca2e2e3c29191dadf68","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1688 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix stoppable check currently does the check in 3 sequential stages: Helix standard checks, custom instance health check and custom partition health check. When one stage had any failure, the subsequent stages are not executed.\r\n\r\nThis poses an issue that if participant happens to ignore all the failed checks in stage 1 but stage 2/3 would have reported some other failures, then it would think it's safe to stop the instance when it's in fact not safe. For example, if an instance would fail INSTANCE_NOT_STABLE in stage 1 and custom partition health check in stage 3, Helix will only return INSTANCE_NOT_STABLE and if participant ignores this failure reason, it will consider the instance safe to stop when it's not.\r\n\r\nProvide an option in Helix stoppable check API, such that when the option is used, Helix will always perform all checks and return all failed checks. Query param: **continueOnFailures**\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testGetStoppableWithAllChecks\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nHelix rest\r\n```\r\n17:14:54,948 [INFO] Tests run: 172, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 92.112 s - in TestSuite\r\n17:14:55,296 [INFO]\r\n17:14:55,296 [INFO] Results:\r\n17:14:55,296 [INFO]\r\n17:14:55,296 [INFO] Tests run: 172, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n17:14:55,297 [INFO]\r\n17:14:55,305 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n17:14:55,305 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n17:14:55,306 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n17:14:55,308 [INFO] Total time:  01:36 min\r\n17:14:55,309 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-25T17:14:55-07:00\r\n17:14:55,309 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1675 Remove requested state update in task framwork.\r\nThis is the first PR of the issue. \r\nThis PR is for lock scope deduction only, because lock scope change expects more review and has independent logic itself.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n*High level design of the lock scope: \r\n\r\nWe can prevent over write by checking the in memory state _stateModel and update ZK conditionally in message handling. Also the in memory state _stateModel update (in both task Runner thread and state transition handling thread), comparing and ZK update need to be protected by a lock.\r\n\r\n*Is it safe to do so? \r\nIn current message handling design, `HelixTaskExecutor` (a message lister that creates and schedules all message handler) guarantees that only one on going state transition per each partition/task at a time, removing this synchronization shouldn't cause any problem. \r\nWhen `onMessage` receives a STATE_TRANSITION_CANCELLATION messages and a ST message for the same entity, a `HelixStateTransitionCancellationHanlder` is created can call cancel(). Changing the lock scope does not have any influence on `HelixStateTransitionCancellationHanlder`.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Why need to Remove lock in HelixStateTransitionHandle\r\nIn the design to remove requested state, task runner thread update CurrentState when task finishes or ends with error state. \r\nHowever, it is possible that the state transition handler is also trying to update CurrentState. It could be an INIT→ RUNNING, RUNNING→CANCEL, or any other state transition message message. We will run into the write conflict.\r\nThis PR removes this redundant synchronization. Will add a smaller scoped lock in the PR that removes requested state.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nOur current Task framework tests covers all state transition types, should be able to cover this change. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures:                                                                                                                                                                      \r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.DelayedAutoRebalancer.TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.beforeTest(org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.DelayedAutoRebalan\r\ncer.TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance)                                                                                                                                      \r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.beforeTest:304->enableInstance:315 expected:<true> but was:<false>                                                       \r\n[INFO]   Run 2: PASS                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[INFO]                                                                        \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 9, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 6                       \r\n[INFO]                                                        \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          \r\n[INFO] Total time:  40.449 s                                                                                                                                                           \r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-04-19T16:45:27-07:00  \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nrerun:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 78.981 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.DelayedAutoRebalancer.TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledI\r\nnstance                                                            \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1617\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR refines the GenericHelixController global tracking record so it acts as expected even we have more than one instance in the JVM. This impacts test logic only in general.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe previously added workaround code has been removed. So the new logic can be tested by the original code.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMaven package plugins in helix are way too old. We found that the build time on some linux machines are ~X5 longer: 0:50 min -> 4:40 min.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting tells maven jar plugins take a much longer time to package jars because of a large number of id group check by maven plugins. And upgrading the maven plugins completely solves the problem: 4:40 min -> 0:28 min.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n11:20:38,148 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n11:20:38,148 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n11:20:38,148 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n11:20:38,149 [INFO] Total time:  28.482 s\r\n11:20:38,149 [INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-22T11:20:38-07:00\r\n11:20:38,149 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nRelated to #1653. This PR aims to mitigate the problem but won't be able to address it completely.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the WAGED.ConstraintBasedAlgorithm sorting logic. So that the replicas are assigned in a strict order. Bigger partitions to be assigned first. This helps to partially avoid the possible issue that the greedy algorithm cannot find a possible solution.\r\n\r\nNote that the code has been optimized so you will see some supporting data structures which do not directly contribute to the main logic. Please check the comment together with the code.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nmvn test passed.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-09T00:38:07Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T21:08:53Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T00:37:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0232f96ced7c29d5232c8581b002c56001fcb29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/37578b085bc1c4d2c6324c8fb34ab007d1b5c51c","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:largePartition","ref":"largePartition","sha":"37578b085bc1c4d2c6324c8fb34ab007d1b5c51c","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror
