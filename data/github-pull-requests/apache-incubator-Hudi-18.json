Adds the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Add hooks in HoodieFileIndex to prune candidate files (to scan) based on secondary key column filters.\r\n  2. Add ability in HoodieMetadataLogRecordReader to Use unmerged log record scanner (HoodieUnMergedLogRecordScanner)\r\n   3. Use the unmerged log record sacnner to buffer records from secondary index partition (of metadata table)\r\n\r\nPending work items:\r\n   1. Merge secondary index records from log files with base files\r\n   2. Handle secondary index records moving across file groups (on updates to the base table)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAllows the query to prune candidate files based on the defined secondary index columns/filters\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the JIRA [HUDI-7394](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7394) for more details on this issue, detailed stack trace and how to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nFor context, I am planning to work on [RFC-50](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/rfc/rfc-50/rfc-50.md) and [RFC-05](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130027233), which is why I am poking around the timeline-related components to get a better understanding of the state of the current code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nStandalone hudi-timeline-server is able to serve timeline instant requests without throwing class conflict exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [X] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [X] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [X] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently HoodieMetadataMetrics stores metrics in memory and these metrics are not pushed by the metric reporters. The metric reporters are configured within Metrics instance. List of changes in the PR:\r\n\r\n1. Metrics related classes have been moved from hudi-client-common to hudi-common.\r\n2. HoodieMetadataMetrics now uses Metrics class so that all the reporters can be supported with it.\r\n3. Some gaps in configs which are added in HoodieMetadataWriteUtils\r\n4. Some metrics related apis and functionality has been moved to HoodieMetricsConfig. The HoodieWriteConfig APIs now delegate to HoodieMetricsConfig for the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThere are constructors and APIs which were using `HoodieWriteConfig` earlier. Now they are using `HoodieMetricsConfig`. `HoodieMetricsConfig` can be obtained by calling `getMetricsConfig()` from the `HoodieWriteConfig` object.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThere are constructors and APIs which were using `HoodieWriteConfig` earlier.

PR is borrowed from PR 10211 (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10211). This lays the groundwork for supporting duplicate keys (non-unique keys) in the HFile reader and writer (for metadata tables). The writer part is fully supported, but the reader side requires some additional support to merge base file and log records when there are duplicate keys (which will come in a subsequent PR). This PR also fixes some minor issues with the reader which was failing a RecodIndex unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nA major requirement for supporting secondary (non-unique) index is the ability in the metadata table to have duplicate keys. This in turn means that the HFile (and delta log files) for the metadata table should support returning list of records for a given key. This PR inmplements the same and it is borrowed from https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10211 (with some fixes in the read path)\r\n\r\nThis lays the groundwork for supporting duplicate keys (non-unique keys) in the HFile reader and writer (for metadata tables).

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Spark SQL DML does not work for a partitioned table with CustomKeyGenerator.  The CustomKeyGenerator requires the write config of the partition fields (`hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field`) to be in the format of `field:type` (e.g., `ts:timestamp,segment:simple`). However, the table config `hoodie.table.partition.fields` in `hoodie.properties` only saves the field names (e.g., `ts,segment`). The Spark SQL writer picks up the partition field names automatically from the `hoodie.table.partition.fields` in `hoodie.properties` to set `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field`, which does not work with the CustomKeyGenerator (errors attached).  And `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field` cannot be overwritten from either SQL statement or the catalog table properties (stored in `catalogProperties` of `HoodieCatalogTable`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes Spark SQL DML with CustomKeyGenerator by allowing the `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE TABLE` to set `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field` to overwrite the write config of the partition fields for CustomKeyGenerator to function properly.  The table config `hoodie.table.partition.fields` in `hoodie.properties` is still in the same format.  The syntax to overwrite the write config of the partition fields looks like:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE table_name USING HUDI\r\nlocation '/table/path'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES (\r\n  hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field = 'ts:timestamp,segment:simple'\r\n)\r\n---\r\nALTER TABLE table_name\r\nSET TBLPROPERTIES (\r\n  hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field = 'ts:timestamp,segment:simple'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter adding the write config of partition path fields to the catalog table, it looks like this in Spark catalog:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)>

A new test class, `TestSparkSqlWithCustomKeyGenerator`, is added to test all DML with CustomKeyGenerator, and the case of setting `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field` with `ALTER TABLE .. SET TBLPROPERTIES (..)` or `CREATE TABLE .. TBLPROPERTIES (..)` at the Spark catalog table level.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up of #10572\r\n\r\nWhile the mentioned PR fixed the runtime error, it did not implement the logic for pushdown which was silently no returning partitions.\r\n\r\nThe current PR does so by:\r\n- refactor to enable one implementation of pushdown per sync client\r\n- provide a glue expression (diverge from hms)\r\n- reorder the partitions in case they are returned misordered by the metastore\r\n- optimize partition retrieval by missing the columns details\r\n- UT has been copied and adapted from hiveSync\r\n- IT has been introduced with moto to simulate aws env\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsing this feature has proven faster metastore sync in case of large number of partitions, from couple of minutes to seconds.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nIntegration testing in aws environment has been done\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the changes to replace most `FileSystem`, `Path`, and `FileStatus` usage with `HoodieStorage`, `StoragePath` and `StoragePathInfo` (introduced in #10567, renamed in #10672) in `hudi-common` module, to remove dependency on Hadoop FS abstraction which is not essential to most Hudi core read and write logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR still keeps using the Hadoop FileSystem-based implementation under the hood.  A follow-up PR will make `HoodieStorage` and I/O implementation pluggable.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this PR is to reduce the usage of Hadoop's `FileSystem`, `Path`, and `FileStatus` usage in `hudi-common` module, mainly to decouple the read path from these classes, so other modules may have leftovers (e.g., on the write path, Spark, etc., which has to rely on these classes) and bridging (e.g., `new Path(storagePath.toUri())`) and type-casting code (e.g., `(FileSystem) storage.getFileSystem()`), which are expected.  The clean-up and code improvements of other modules are deferred to [HUDI-7363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7363).\r\n\r\nHere are details to attend to (especially for reviewers):\r\n- `HoodieStorage` replaces `FileSystem` wherever the storage abstraction is needed only.  `HoodieTableMetaClient` provides `HoodieStorage` with `getStorage()`, replacing `getFs()`.\r\n- `HoodieStorage` calls replace `FileSystem` calls.  Here are a few differences to be reminded of:\r\n  - `storage.createDirectory(path)` replaces `fs.mkdirs(path)`\r\n  - `storage.deleteFile(path)` replaces `fs.delete(path, false)`; `storage.deleteDirectory(path)` replaces `fs.delete(path, true)`.\r\n  - `HoodieStorage` list and glob calls return Java List instead of array.\r\n- `StoragePath` replaces `Path` and `CachingPath` wherever the `Path` instance is not particularly needed (e.g., serving file system view).  `StoragePath` holds the URI instance inside which is supposed to be `Path` URI compatible.  The transformation between two are done in: (1) `Path` -> `StoragePath`: `new StoragePath(path.toUri())`, (2) `StoragePath` to `Path`: `new Path(storagePath.toUri())`.\r\n- `StoragePathFilter` replaces `PathFilter`.\r\n- `StoragePathInfo` POJO replaces the `FileStatus`, by storing only necessary fields.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the effort to provide Hudi storage abstraction and decouple `hudi-common` from hadoop dependencies. For reference, the single big-change PR can be found here: #10360.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOne step further to decouple `hudi-common` module from Hadoop dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the generic `StorageConfiguration` to store configuration for I/O with `HoodieStorage`. Given there's overhead of reinitializing Hadoop's `Configuration` instance, the approach is to wrap the instance in the `HadoopStorageConfiguration` implementation.  This change will enable us to remove our dependency on Hadoop's `Configuration` class.  When integrated, places using `Configuration` will be replaced by `StorageConfiguration` and the `StorageConfiguration` will be passed around for instantiating `HoodieStorage` (unless Hadoop-based readers need the `Configuration` instance).\r\n\r\nThis is part of the effort to provide Hudi storage abstraction and decouple `hudi-common` from hadoop dependencies. For reference, the single big-change PR can be found here: #10360.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact give this PR does not have the integration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Avoids collecting intermediate results until they are truly required in a centralized place (driver for spark)\r\n- Early exit when no matches after bloom filter check\r\n- Lazily evaluate a count only used in one, non-default code path of the spark writer flow to avoid the extra count costs\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImprove efficiency of the bloom filter for spark users\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `SeekableDataInputStream` for random access on a file, i.e., seeking to a position in a file and reading the content.  The random access on a file is used by the log scanner and reader.  Before this PR, the log reader relies on `FSDataInputStream` which is coupled with Hadoop file system.  To allow Hadoop-independent file systems to be used to read log files, the interface `SeekableDataInputStream` is introduced to provide random access APIs without relying on `FSDataInputStream`.\r\n\r\n`HadoopSeekableDataInputStream` implements `SeekableDataInputStream` with `FSDataInputStream` instance and is used to realize the same logic as before (no behavior change).\r\n\r\nThis is part of the effort to provide Hudi storage abstraction and decouple `hudi-common` from hadoop dependencies. For reference, the single big-change PR can be found here: #10360.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes random access on files and log reading independent of Hadoop APIs.  No behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `HoodieStorage` abstraction and Hudi's counterpart classes for Hadoop File System classes (`org.apache.hadoop.fs.`[`FileSystem`, `Path`, `PathFilter`, `FileStatus`]) to decouple Hudi's implementation from Hadoop classes, so it's much easier to plugin different file system implementation.  Detailed changes include:\r\n- `HoodieStorage` interface: the counterpart class for Hadoop's `FileSystem`.  This provides all I/O APIs on files and directories on storage, such as `open`, `read`, etc.  This can also contain storage layer optimizations like caching, federated storage layout, hot/cold storage separation, etc.  This needs to be implemented based on particular systems.\r\n  - `HoodieHadoopStorage` implemenets `HoodieStorage` with Hadoop's `FileSystem`.\r\n- `HoodieLocation`: the counterpart class for Hadoop's `Path`.  We migrate and simply path parsing logic in this class.\r\n- `HoodieLocationFilter` interface: the counterpart class for Hadoop's `PathFilter`.\r\n- `HoodieFileStatus`: the counterpart class for Hadoop's `FileStatus`.  This keeps the location, length, isDirectory, and modification which are used by Hudi.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the effort to provide Hudi storage abstraction and decouple `hudi-common` from hadoop dependencies. For reference, the single big-change PR can be found here: #10360.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact as this PR does not have the integration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Added new MetricsReporter implementation org.apache.hudi.metrics.m3.M3MetricsReporter which emits metrics to M3\r\n- Added new dependencies in HUDI : `com.uber.m3:tally-m3`, `com.uber.m3:tally-core`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Users using https://m3db.io can enable reporting metrics to M3 by setting `hoodie.metrics.reporter.type` as `M3` and their corresponding host address/port in `hoodie.metrics.m3.host` / `hoodie.metrics.m3.port` \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocumentation should be updated with the new config options for M3 metrics reporting:\r\n- `hoodie.metrics.m3.host`\r\n- `hoodie.metrics.m3.port`\r\n- `hoodie.metrics.m3.tags`\r\n- `hoodie.metrics.m3.service`\r\n- `hoodie.metrics.m3.env`\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-25T23:38:17Z","updated_at":"2024-03-05T16:41:39Z","closed_at":"2024-03-05T16:41:39Z","merged_at":"2024-03-05T16:41:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c7ee8ef210ae7b410d6e8039a770b5cf27c4067","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6388496005,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABfMi2hQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.2","name":"release-0.14.2","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Patches/Issue

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new module `hudi-hadoop-common` for hadoop-specific implementation.  This serves as the first step to decouple `hudi-common` module from hadoop dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR include:\r\n- Creates a new module `hudi-hadoop-common` and every bundle packages classes from this module.  For now, this PR makes `hudi-common` to depend on `hudi-hadoop-common`.  Follow-up PRs will address the decoupling `hudi-common` from `hudi-hadoop-common`, which requires much more changes.\r\n- Moves a few hadoop-specific implementation classes from`hudi-common` to `hudi-hadoop-common`.\r\n- Moves a few common IO-related and util classes from `hudi-common` to `hudi-io` so `hudi-hadoop-common` can use them.\r\n- Creates `HadoopFSUtils` class and move hadoop-specific FS utils from `FSUtils` to this class.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the effort to provide Hudi storage abstraction and decouple `hudi-common` from hadoop dependencies. For reference, the single big-change PR can be found here: #10360.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo Hudi behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe'll add release notes around this change.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-25T20:54:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T01:37:03Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T01:37:03Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T01:37:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef70de2bba7ba88381ee066875f6d1c55ee4b028","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5167491007,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNAGnvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-1.0.0","name":"release-1.0.0","color":"E82785","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/10564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/7143fc0d8b881c9d28040d2b9c290c4d8b2e0f54","head":{"label":"yihua:HUDI-7335-create-hadoop-common-module","ref":"HUDI-7335-create-hadoop-common-module","sha":"7143fc0d8b881c9d28040d2b9c290c4d8b2e0f54","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196439401,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mzk0MDE=","name":"hudi","full_name":"yihua/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yihua/h

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBy bisecting the tests of Hadoop-mr and java client modules, we figure out a couple of flaky tests.\r\nAfter carefully profiling one of these tests, we realized that a rocksdb thread was running after all tests finished.\r\nThen we disabled the explicit usage of EMBEDDED_KV_STORE, which is backed by rocksdb and ran the test for 10s of times to confirm that the timeout issue did not happen again.\r\n\r\nWe may need to debug further, but we can disable the EMBEDDED_KV_STORE based FSV for now.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBetter CIs.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdates the `Transformer` classes to take in a `Supplier<Option<Schema>>` instead of `Option<Schema>` so that the latest value can be used when the `transformedSchema` method is called.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Provides more accurate schema\r\n- Lazy evaluation of the schema also avoids an extra call to schema registries and potential exceptions that come with that\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone, this code is not actively used\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Update AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader and implementations to accept a HoodieTableMetaClient directly, and skip constructing one if provided\r\n-- org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader#AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader\r\n-- org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieMergedLogRecordScanner\r\n-- org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieUnMergedLogRecordScanner\r\n\r\n- Update Spark engine-related callers of AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader to pass in an already constructed HoodieTableMetaClient, if feasible and applicable. Specifically, for cases where the Spark driver would already have a HoodieTableMetaClient created, and would a launch a Spark stage where each task would be creating/using a AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader instance. \r\n\r\nSee HUDI-7316 for context\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nCurrently, when using Spark engine, there are cases where each Spark task needs to construct/use a AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader instance, and while doing so will create a HoodieMetaClient and will read the active timeline for it. This causes a file listing call to the Distributed file system service (such as HDFS namenode). If the caller (that initiated this Spark stage from the driver) can feasibly pass in a HoodieMetaClient (with active timeline already loaded) then allowing the caller to pass in this existing HoodieMetaClient to AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader implementations will avoid this unnecessary file listing call. For users that launch Spark jobs with hundreds or thousands of executors, this could potentially avoid hundreds or thousands of file listing calls (which would likely happen around the same time, since all these tasks would be initiated in the same spark stage).\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport literal type auto conversion for filter push down.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nGiven the field d_date with type of date, and then execute the SQL below:\r\n\r\nselect ... where d_date = '2024-01-01';\r\n\r\nIt will convert string literal '2024-01-01' to integer (epoch day) and then push down to parquet filter.\r\n\r\nThis patch is after HUDI-7303, which fixed the problem: value with date type will be unexpectedly converted to Long.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLow impact.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow risk.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n- Add a new flag to `org.apache.hudi.client.transaction.lock.LockManager` , that is set once the HoodieLockMetrics lock duration timer had started, and is unset after said timer has been ended. This flag is used to prevent closing the lock duration timer if it has not already been started\r\n- This is needed to avoid the scenario in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7308 , where if an exception is raised while LockManager tries to acquire lock of LockProvider, and the caller then directly calls LockManager::close (in order to ensure lock is released for other users) , another exception ``HoodieException(\"Timer was not started\")`  will be thrown, which may \"suppress\" the original exception encountered when LockManager tried to acquire lock.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- This should allow users to easily identify/debug issues when an implementation of LockProvider throws an exception during `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock#tryLock(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
