What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `HiveClientImpl.scala` when we create new SessionState, we prepare configuration and the options passed to `start-thriftserver.sh` via  `--hiveConf` need to take precedence when creating `HiveConf`  i.e  in order \r\n`hadoopConf < sparkConf < overrideProps(--hiveconf) < extraConfig`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs per the documentation here, https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-distributed-sql-engine.html user can provide `--hiveconf` to override the hive configurations when using `start-thriftserver.sh` but as per the code, https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L182 here, the hive-site properties (part of hadoopConf) will override the configuration done from command line which is not as per expectation\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT along with Base UTs can Pass","created_at":"2019-12-29T10:31:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-31T00:22:15Z","closed_at":"2020-05-31T00:22:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72fbe6296863a0ee2c80049428854a3ef2cd4426","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3718df989c02641f864432b246313a158a11b9e6","head":{"label":"ajithme:hiveconf","ref":"hiveconf","sha":"3718df989c02641f864432b246313a158a11b9e6","user":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124182301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQxODIzMDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ajithme/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor `RandomForest.findSplits` by applying `aggregateByKey` instead of `groupByKey`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent impl of `RandomForest.findSplits` uses `groupByKey` to collect non-zero values for each feature, so it is quite dangerous.\r\nAfter looking into the following logic to find splits, I found that collecting all non-zero values is not necessary, and we only need weightSums of distinct values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY` is supported with ensuring the provided path is always using `file://` as scheme and removing the check which throws exception if we do insert overwrite by mentioning directory with `LOCAL` syntax\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nwithout the modification in PR, ``` insert overwrite local directory <location> using ```\r\n\r\nthrows exception \r\n\r\n```\r\nError: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\n\r\nLOCAL is not supported in INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY to data source(line 1, pos 0)\r\n```\r\nwhich was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18975, but this restriction is not needed, hence dropping the same.\r\nKeep behaviour consistent for local and remote file-system in  `INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after this change `INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY` will not throw exception\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to only convert first few elements of collection accumulators in `LiveEntityHelpers.newAccumulatorInfos`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOne Spark job on our cluster uses collection accumulator to collect something and has encountered an exception like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n    at java.util.Arrays.copyOf(Arrays.java:3332)\r\n    at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.ensureCapacityInternal(AbstractStringBuilder.java:124)\r\n    at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:448)\r\n    at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:136)\r\n    at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:131)\r\n    at java.util.AbstractCollection.toString(AbstractCollection.java:462)\r\n    at java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableCollection.toString(Collections.java:1035)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.status.LiveEntityHelpers$$anonfun$newAccumulatorInfos$2$$anonfun$apply$3.apply(LiveEntity.scala:596)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.status.LiveEntityHelpers$$anonfun$newAccumulatorInfos$2$$anonfun$apply$3.apply(LiveEntity.scala:596)\r\n    at scala.Option.map(Option.scala:146)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.status.LiveEntityHelpers$$anonfun$newAccumulatorInfos$2.apply(LiveEntity.scala:596)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.status.LiveEntityHelpers$$anonfun$newAccumulatorInfos$2.apply(LiveEntity.scala:591)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LiveEntityHelpers.newAccumulatorInfos` converts `AccumulableInfo`s to `v1.AccumulableInfo` by calling `toString` on accumulator's value. For collection accumulator, it might take much more memory when in string representation, for example, collection accumulator of long values, and cause OOM (in this job, the driver memory is 6g).\r\n\r\nLooks like the results of `newAccumulatorInfos` are used in api and ui. For such usage, it also does not make sense to have very long string of complete collection accumulators.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Collection accumulator now only shows first few elements in api and ui.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nManual test. Launched a Spark shell, ran:\r\n```scala\r\nval accum = sc.collectionAccumulator[Long](\"Collection Accumulator Example\")\r\nsc.range(0, 10000, 1, 1).foreach(x => accum.add(x))\r\naccum.value\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2533\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-30 at 2 03 43 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor some reason, some Hadoop classes themselves cause errors in Scala 2.13 when subclassed. It complains that Hadoop's LocalFileSystem hierarchy for example has an invalid override of `append`, when I'm not sure I see the issue. \r\n\r\nAnyway, rather than potentially wait on a fix, we can simply prefer delegation to subclassing, and other tricks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCross building for 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. All changed code is test code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran 2.13 compilation to ensure it fixes the compile issue.\r\nExisting tests will show whether it still works in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `ParquetUtils.splitFiles()` I changed the logic to:\r\n1) if `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema=false`, then don't sort any files.\r\n2) if `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema=true`,\r\n   2.1) if `spark.sql.parquet.respectSummaryFiles=false`, then sort all files\r\n   2.1) if `spark.sql.parquet.respectSummaryFiles=true`, then only sort metadata files\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to [SPARK-11500](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11500), files' order only matters when schema merged is need. So, we cloud avoid unnecessary sort when we don't merge schema, especially when there're plenty of files.\r\n\r\nAnother minor improvement is grouping metadata files and data files firstly before constructing `FileTypes` to avoid traversing all file for three times.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPartially covered by SPARK-11500. And I also want to test metadata file part, but I don't find any metadata files while using write parquet

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is based on #23921 but revised to be simpler, as well as adds UT to test the behavior.\r\n(This patch contains the commit from #23921 to retain credit.)\r\n\r\nSpark loads new JARs for `ADD JAR` and `CREATE FUNCTION ... USING JAR` into jar classloader in shared state, and changes current thread's context classloader to jar classloader as many parts of remaining codes rely on current thread's context classloader.\r\n\r\nThis would work if the further queries will run in same thread and there's no change on context classloader for the thread, but once the context classloader of current thread is switched back by various reason, Spark fails to create instance of class for the function.\r\n\r\nThis bug mostly affects spark-shell, as spark-shell will roll back current thread's context classloader at every prompt. But it may also affects the case of job-server, where the queries may be running in multiple threads.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue via switching the context classloader to the classloader which loads the class. Hopefully FunctionBuilder created by `makeFunctionBuilder` has the information of Class as a part of closure, hence the Class itself can be provided regardless of current thread's context classloader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, end users cannot execute Hive UDF using JAR twice in spark-shell.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces messageHandler parameter that can be provided to Kafka DStream, which allows processing events received from Kafka at an early stage.\r\n\r\nLack of messageHandler parameter to KafkaUtils.createDirectStrem(...) in the new Kafka 10 API is what prevents us from upgrading our processes to use it, and here's why:\r\n\r\n1. messageHandler() allowed parsing / filtering / projecting huge JSON files at an early stage (only a small subset of JSON fields is required for a process), without this current cluster configuration doesn't keep up with the traffic.\r\n2. Transforming Kafka events right after a stream is created prevents from using HasOffsetRanges interface later. This means that whole message must be propagated to the end of a pipeline, which is very ineffective.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nClear `executorsPendingToRemove` before remove executors will cause all tasks running on those \"pending to remove\" executors to count failures. But that's not true for the case of `executorsPendingToRemove(execId)=true`.\r\n\r\nBesides, `executorsPendingToRemove` will be cleaned up within `removeExecutor()` at the end just as same as `executorsPendingLossReason`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`str_to_map ` has not implemented with codegen support, which prevents a query that contains this expression from being whole stage codegen-ed.\r\nThis PR removes `CodegenFallBack` from `StringToMap`, add the codegen support for it. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nimprove codegen coverage and gain better perfomance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnify `DriverEndpoint. executorIsAlive()` and `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend .isExecutorActive()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`DriverEndPoint` has method `executorIsAlive()` to check wether an executor is alive/active, while `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` has method `isExecutorActive()` to do the same work. But, `isExecutorActive()` seems forget to consider `executorsPendingLossReason`. Unify these two methods makes behavior be consistent between `DriverEndPoint` and `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` and make code more easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass

`Dispatcher.registerRpcEndpoint()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/481fb63f97d87d5b2e9e1f9b30bee466605b5a72/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rpc/netty/Dispatcher.scala#L64-L77\r\n\r\n`getMessageLoop()` initializes a new Inbox for this endpoint for both DedicatedMessageLoop \r\n and SharedMessageLoop, which calls `onStart()`  \"asynchronously\" and \"eventually\" via posting `OnStart` message. `onStart()` will initialize UI page instance(s), so the execution of `endpointRefs.put()` and initializing UI page instance(s) are \"concurrent\".\r\n\r\nMasterPage and WorkerPage retrieve endpoint ref and store it as \"val\" assuming endpoint ref is valid when they're initialized - so in bad case they could store \"null\" as endpoint ref, and don't change.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/481fb63f97d87d5b2e9e1f9b30bee466605b5a72/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/ui/MasterPage.scala#L33-L38\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/481fb63f97d87d5b2e9e1f9b30bee466605b5a72/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/worker/ui/WorkerPage.scala#L35-L41\r\n\r\nThis patch breaks down the step to `find the right message loop` and `register endpoint to message loop`, and ensure endpoint ref is set \"before\" registering endpoint to message loop.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe observed the test failures from Jenkins; below are the

Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs. \r\n\r\nYou can also reproduce the bug consistently via adding `Thread.sleep(1000)` just before `endpointRefs.put(endpoint, endpointRef)` in `Dispatcher.registerRpcEndpoint(...)`.","created_at":"2019-12-26T05:18:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T23:30:31Z","closed_at":"2020-01-06T16:42:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fdc4d2b2e74586e45c3513bef8a41b9712e9170","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68fcd51bb384ed9c0cf6220ddedd9584af02d8fc","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-30313","ref":"SPARK-30313","sha":"68fcd51bb384ed9c0cf6220ddedd9584af02d8fc","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNow Spark can propagate constraint during sql optimization when `spark.sql.constraintPropagation.enabled` is true, then `where c = 1` will convert to `where c = 1 and c is not null`. We also can use constraint in `SimplifyBinaryComparison`.\r\n\r\n`SimplifyBinaryComparison` will simplify expression which is not nullable and semanticEquals. And we also can simplify if one expression is infered `IsNotNull`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify SQL.\r\n```\r\ncreate table test (c1 string);\r\n\r\nexplain extended select c1 from test where c1 = c1 limit 10;\r\n-- before\r\nGlobalLimit 10\r\n+- LocalLimit 10\r\n   +- Filter (isnotnull(c1#20) AND (c1#20 = c1#20))\r\n      +- Relation[c1#20]\r\n-- after\r\nGlobalLimit 10\r\n+- LocalLimit 10\r\n    +- Filter (isnotnull(c1#20)\r\n        +- Relation[c1#20]\r\n\r\nexplain extended select c1 from test where c1 > c1 limit 10;\r\n-- before\r\nGlobalLimit 10\r\n+- LocalLimit 10\r\n   +- Filter (isnotnull(c1#20) && (c1#20 > c1#20))\r\n      +- Relation[c1#20]\r\n-- after\r\nLocalRelation <empty>, [c1#20]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake logging events dropping every 60s works fine, the orignal implementaion some times not working due to susequent events comming and updating the DroppedEventCounter\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrenly, the logging may be skipped and delayed a long time under high concurrency, that make debugging hard. So This PR will try to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the intermittent test failure on ThriftServerQueryTestSuite/ThriftServerWithSparkContextSuite, getting ConnectException when querying to thrift server.\r\n(https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/115646/testReport/)\r\n\r\nThe relevant unit test log messages are following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n19/12/23

ThriftCLIService: Thrift server has stopped\r\n```\r\n(Here the error is logged as `WARN HiveConnection: Failed to connect to localhost:15441` - the actual stack trace can be seen on Jenkins test summary.)\r\n\r\nThe reason of test failure: Thrift(Binary|Http)CLIService prepare and launch the service asynchronously (in new thread), which suites are not waiting for completion and just start running tests, ends up with race condition.\r\n\r\nThat can be easily reproduced, via adding artificial sleep in `ThriftBinaryCLIService.run()` here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ba3f6330dd2b6054988f1f6f0ffe014fc4969088/sql/hive-thriftserver/v2.3/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/thrift/ThriftBinaryCLIService.java#L49\r\n\r\n(Note that `sleep` should be added before initializing server socket. E.g. Line 57)\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the test initialization logic to try executing simple query to wait until the service is available. The patch also refactors the code to apply the change both ThriftServerQueryTestSuite and ThriftServerWithSparkContextSuite easily.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the intermittent failure observed here:\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/115646/testReport/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nArtificially made the test fail consistently (by the approach described above), and confirmed the patch fixed the test.","created_at":"2019-12-24T10:08:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T14:00:19Z","closed_at":"2019-12-27T07:31:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"341f5b6e5f455b753d7435546ff65ab324a56534","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/160ca1a9f008ff4d7e17fff166e795ac17d20963","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-30345","ref":"SPARK-30345","sha":"160ca1a9f008ff4d7e17fff166e795ac17d20963","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. For the interval arithmetic functions, e.g. `add`/`subtract`/`negative`/`multiply`/`divide`, enable overflow check when `ANSI` is on. \r\n\r\n2. For `multiply`/`divide`,  throw an exception when an overflow happens in spite of `ANSI` is on/off.  \r\n\r\n3. `add`/`subtract`/`negative` stay the same for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n4. `divide` by 0 throws ArithmeticException whether `ANSI` or not as same as numerics.\r\n\r\n5. These behaviors fit the numeric type operations fully when ANSI is on.\r\n\r\n6. These behaviors fit the numeric type operations fully when ANSI is off, except 2 and 4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. bug fix\r\n2. `ANSI` support\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nWhen `ANSI` is on, interval `add`/`subtract`/`negative`/`multiply`/`divide` will overflow if any field overflows\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently if function lookup fails, spark will give it a second chance by casting decimal type to double type. But for cases where decimal type doesn't exist, it's meaningless to lookup again and cause extra cost like unnecessary metastore access. We should throw exceptions directly in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCovered by existing tests.","created_at":"2019-12-24T02:38:15Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:22:34Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T16:09:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b16ef8a45d9f8de52b3b66a94de510ea253016a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71b85e627e4cd66ab456c43f8c328254795a10eb","head":{"label":"wzhfy:avoid_udf_fail_twice","ref":"avoid_udf_fail_twice","sha":"71b85e627e4cd66ab456c43f8c328254795a10eb","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

Internally, these converters may have mutable state and may return mutable objects. In most cases, each `converter` is only invoked once per Parquet record (this is true for top-level fields, for example). However, arrays and maps may call their child element converters multiple times per Parquet record: in these cases we must be careful to copy any mutable outputs returned by child converters.\r\n\r\nIn the existing code, `InternalRow`s are copied whenever they are stored into _any_ parent container (not just maps and arrays). This copying can be especially expensive for deeply-nested fields, since a deep copy is performed at every level of nesting.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the code to avoid copies for structs that are directly nested in structs; see inline code comments for an argument for why this is safe. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Correctness**:  I added new test cases to `ParquetIOSuite` to increase coverage of nested structs, including structs nested in arrays: previously this suite didn't test that case, so we used to lack mutation coverage of this `copy()` code (the suite's tests still passed if I incorrectly removed the `.copy()` in all cases). I also added a test for maps with struct keys and modified the existing \"map with struct values\" test case include maps with two elements (since the incorrect omission of a `copy()` can only be detected if the map has multiple elements).\r\n\r\n**Performance**: I put together a simple local benchmark demonstrating the performance problems:\r\n\r\nFirst, construct a nested schema:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  case class Inner(\r\n    f1: Int,\r\n    f2: Long,\r\n    f3: String,\r\n    f4: Int,\r\n    f5: Long,\r\n    f6: String,\r\n    f7: Int,\r\n    f8: Long,\r\n    f9: String,\r\n    f10: Int\r\n  )\r\n  \r\n  case class Wrapper1(inner: Inner)\r\n  case class Wrapper2(wrapper1: Wrapper1)\r\n  case class Wrapper3(wrapper2: Wrapper2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Wrapper3`'s schema looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- wrapper2: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- wrapper1: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- inner: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f1: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f2: long (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f3: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f4: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f5: long (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f6: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f7: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f8: long (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f9: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |    |-- f10: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, generate some fake data:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  val data = spark.range(1, 1000 * 1000 * 25, 1, 1).map { i =>\r\n    Wrapper3(Wrapper2(Wrapper1(Inner(\r\n      i.toInt,\r\n      i * 2,\r\n      (i * 3).toString,\r\n      (i * 4).toInt,\r\n      i * 5,\r\n      (i * 6).toString,\r\n      (i * 7).toInt,\r\n      i * 8,\r\n      (i * 9).toString,\r\n      (i * 10).toInt\r\n    ))))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  data.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/parquet-test\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then ran a simple benchmark consisting of\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/parquet-test\").selectExpr(\"hash(*)\").rdd.count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the `hash(*)` is designed to force decoding of all Parquet fields but avoids `RowEncoder` costs in the `.rdd.count()` stage.\r\n\r\nIn the old code, expensive copying takes place at every level of nesting; this is apparent in the following flame graph:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50748/71389014-88a15380-25af-11ea-9537-3e87a2aef179.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this PR's changes, the above toy benchmark runs ~30% faster.","created_at":"2019-12-24T02:19:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T05:02:00Z","closed_at":"2020-01-07T05:02:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b29757d0bc0c0205d6d964639fae6ab71620f153","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f1af94c6cfc72651c3209bc0d31ae1bef140988","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:joshrosen/faster-parquet-nested-scan-by-avoiding-copies","ref":"joshrosen/faster-parquet-nested-scan-by-avoiding-copies","sha":"0f1af94c6cfc72651c3209bc0d31ae1bef140988","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch removes TODO comments which are left to address changing case classes having vars to normal classes in spark-sql-kafka module - the pattern is actually discouraged, but still worth to break it, as we already use automatic toString implementation and we may be using more.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere're too many classes placed in a single package \"org.apache.spark.sql.kafka010\" which classes can be grouped by purpose.\r\n\r\nAs a part of change in SPARK-21869 (#26845), we moved out producer related classes to \"org.apache.spark.sql.kafka010.producer\" and only expose necessary classes/methods to the outside of package. This patch applies the same to consumer related classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSemi-structured data is used widely in the data industry for reporting events in a wide variety of formats. Click events in product analytics can be stored as json. Some application logs can be in the form of delimited key=value text. Some data may be in xml.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to be able to signal Spark that such a column exists. This will then enable Spark to \"auto-parse\" these columns on the fly. The proposal is to store this information as part of the column metadata, in the fields:\r\n - format: The format of the semi-structured column, e.g. json, xml, avro\r\n - options: Options for parsing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, an application may hang if we don't remove a lost executor from `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` as it may happens due to:\r\n\r\n1) In `expireDeadHosts()`, `HeartbeatReceiver` calls `scheduler.executorLost()`;\r\n\r\n2) Before `HeartbeatReceiver` calls `sc.killAndReplaceExecutor()`(which would mark the lost executor as \"pendingToRemove\") in a separate thread,  `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` may begins to launch tasks on that executor without realizing it has been lost indeed.\r\n\r\n3) If that lost executor doesn't shut down gracefully, `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend ` may never receive a disconnect event. As a result, tasks launched on that lost executor become orphans. While at the same time, driver just thinks that those tasks are still running and waits forever.\r\n\r\nRemoving the lost executor from `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` would let `TaskSetManager` mark those tasks as failed which avoids app hang. Furthermore, it cleans up records in `executorDataMap`, which may never be removed in such case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated existed tests.\r\n\r\nClose

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses review comments in #26960 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26960#discussion_r360661930 / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26960#discussion_r360661947) which were not addressed in the patch. Addressing these review comments will let the code less dependent on actual implementation as it only relies on `Time` interface in Kafka.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese were review comments in previous PR and they bring actual benefit though they're minors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to prune unnecessary nested fields from Generate which has no Project on top of it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Optimizer, we can prune nested columns from Project(projectList, Generate). However, unnecessary columns could still possibly be read in Generate, if no Project on top of it. We should prune it too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-22T05:33:13Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:38:10Z","closed_at":"2020-01-25T06:17:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d038dca26a2046b0f03b63c51d4e22582413b36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35b32ec3eb72629ffcfbc7ab736fe536b0055fd2","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-29721","ref":"SPARK-29721","sha":"35b32ec3eb72629ffcfbc7ab736fe536b0055fd2","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnhance RuleExecutor strategy to take different actions when exceeding max iterations. And raise exception if analyzer exceed max iterations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, both analyzer and optimizer just log warning message if rule execution exceed max iterations. They should have different behavior. Analyzer should raise exception to indicates the plan is not fixed after max iterations, while optimizer just log warning to keep the current plan. This is more feasible after SPARK-30138 was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllows JSON strings to be parsed through dot and bracket notation instead of having to write \"get_json_object\". We add a feature flag to control this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe column needs to be a JSON object for this to work. JSON arrays are not supported and would return nulls. If a column is a JSON array, e.g. `[{\"a\":1},{\"a\":2},...]`, `explode(from_json(colName, expr(\"array<string>\")))` can be used to first explode the array into the JSON objects.\r\n\r\nWhile the JSON column can be resolved case insensitively, the JSON fields are case sensitive.\r\nFor example, imagine the column `foo`:\r\n```\r\n{\"a\":\"bar\", \"b\":{\"field1\":\"v1\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`foo.b.field1`, `FOO.b.field1` would work, but `foo.B.FIELD1` would return a null value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nget_json_object is a hard to use and verbose API. This API would greatly help data engineers store their data as raw json columns, and data analysts access the fields that they care about, without having to deal with complicated UDFs, and JSON

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support pushed down filters in CSV datasource. The reason of pushing a filter up to `UnivocityParser` is to apply the filter as soon as all its attributes become available i.e. converted from CSV fields to desired values according to the schema. This allows to skip conversions of other values if the filter returns `false`. This can improve performance when pushed filters are highly selective and conversion of CSV string fields to desired values are comparably expensive ( for example, conversion to `TIMESTAMP` values).\r\n\r\nHere are details of the implementation:\r\n- `UnivocityParser.convert()` converts parsed CSV tokens one-by-one sequentially starting from index 0 up to `parsedSchema.length - 1`. At current index `i`, it applies filters that refer to attributes at row fields indexes `0..i`. If any filter returns `false`, it skips conversions of other input tokens.\r\n- Pushed filters are converted to expressions. The expressions are bound to row positions according to `requiredSchema`. The expressions are compiled to predicates via generating Java code.\r\n- To be able to apply predicates to partially initialized rows, the predicates are grouped, and combined via the `And` expression. Final predicate at index `N` can refer to row fields at the positions `0..N`, and can be applied to a row even if other fields at the positions `N+1..requiredSchema.lenght-1` are not set.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fix insert overwrite table error when running multiple speculative task. This PR introduces task attempt id appended to dynamic partition staging dir to identify different speculative task output dir rather than all speculative tasks use same output dir. CommitTask in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol carries attempt id in TaskCommitMessage\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR fix insert overwrite to DataSource table with dynamic partition error when running multiple task attempts. Suppose there are one task attempt and one speculative task attempt, the speculative would raise FileAlreadyExistsException because of same staging dir attempt tasks commit\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome aspects of `as[T]` are not intuitive and expected behaviour is not provided elsewhere:\r\n* Extra columns that are not part of the type `T` are not dropped.\r\n* Order of columns is not aligned with schema of `T`.\r\n\r\n**This PR adds a stricter version of `as[T]` to `Dataset`.** \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of `as[T]` is not intuitive when you read code like `df.as[T].write.csv(\"data.csv\")`. The result depends on the actual schema of `df`, where `def as[T](): Dataset[T]` should be agnostic to the schema of `df`.\r\n\r\nA method that enforces schema of `T` on a given Dataset would be very convenient and allows to articulate and guarantee above assumptions about your data with the native Spark Dataset API. This method plays a more explicit and enforcing role than `as[T]` with respect to columns and column order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds a new method to `Dataset`. It does not touch the existing `as[T]`.\r\n\r\nPossible naming of a stricter version of `as[T]`:\r\n* `as[T](strict = true)`\r\n* `toDS[T]` (as in `toDF`)\r\n* `selectAs[T]` (as this is merely selecting the columns of schema `T`)\r\n\r\nThis PR chooses the `toDS[T]` naming.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests for `as[T]` have been extended to assert the actual schema and emphasize the differences between `as[T]` and `toDS[T]`. Tests for `toDS[T]` are based on the `as[T]` tests.","created_at":"2019-12-20T15:19:42Z","updated_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:17Z","closed_at":"2020-12-19T00:51:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f68df2b53a10a83e7b41a938ba72c769c22e084","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b45f296a60992ae56925aa004bcc0d8bf0f0faf","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-stricter-as","ref":"branch-stricter-as","sha":"4b45f296a60992ae56925aa004bcc0d8bf0f0faf","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

production environment, ytag is a json wrapped by single quotes,as follows\r\n```\r\n{'y1': 'shuma', 'y2': 'shuma:shouji'}\r\n{'y1': 'jiaoyu', 'y2': 'jiaoyu:gaokao'}\r\n{'y1': 'yule', 'y2':

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch upgrades the version of Kafka to 2.4, which supports Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nThere're some incompatible changes in Kafka 2.4 which the patch addresses as well:\r\n\r\n* `ZkUtils` is removed -> Replaced with `KafkaZkClient`\r\n* Majority of methods are removed in `AdminUtils` -> Replaced with `AdminZkClient`\r\n* Method signature of `Scheduler.schedule` is changed (return type) -> leverage `DeterministicScheduler` to avoid implementing `ScheduledFuture`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Kafka 2.4 supports Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as Kafka API is known to be compatible across versions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds and exposes the options, 'recursiveFileLookup' and 'pathGlobFilter' in file sources 'mergeSchema' in ORC, into documentation.\r\n\r\n- `recursiveFileLookup` at file sources: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24830 ([SPARK-27627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27627))\r\n- `pathGlobFilter` at file sources: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24518 ([SPARK-27990](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27990))\r\n- `mergeSchema` at ORC: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24043 ([SPARK-11412](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11412))\r\n\r\n**Note that** `timeZone` option was not moved from `DataFrameReader.options` as I assume it will likely affect other datasources as well once DSv2 is complete.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo document available options in sources properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIn PySpark, `pathGlobFilter` can be set via `DataFrameReader.(text|orc|parquet|json|csv)` and `DataStreamReader.(text|orc|parquet|json|csv)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the doc and checked the output. Option setting in PySpark is rather a logical change. I manually tested one only:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls -al tmp\r\n...\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 hyukjin.kwon  staff     3 Dec 20 12:19 aa\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 hyukjin.kwon  staff     3 Dec 20 12:19 ab\r\n-rw-r--r--

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd identifier and catalog information in DataSourceV2Relation so it would be possible to do richer checks in checkAnalysis step.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn data source v2, table implementations are all customized so we may not be able to get the resolved identifier from tables them selves. Therefore we encode the table and catalog information in DSV2Relation so no external changes are needed to make sure this information is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests in the following suites:\r\nCatalogManagerSuite.scala\r\nCatalogV2UtilSuite.scala\r\nSupportsCatalogOptionsSuite.scala\r\nPlanResolutionSuite.scala\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-20T01:56:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T21:00:17Z","closed_at":"2020-01-26T21:00:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c58f5fb333f56a48ce297090a1353d8c015c0412","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df29683d38260cb7f69adfccdc7fab2d315e663e","head":{"label":"yuchenhuo:SPARK-30314","ref":"SPARK-30314","sha":"df29683d38260cb7f69adfccdc7fab2d315e663e","user":{"login":"yuchenhuo","id":37087310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg3MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37087310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchenhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127182449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjcxODI0NDk=","name":"OSS","full_name":"yuchenhuo/OSS","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuchenhuo","id":37087310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDg3MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37087310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchenhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchenhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuchenhuo/OSS","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to preserve existing permission/acls of paths when truncate table/partition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen Spark SQL truncates table, it deletes the paths of table/partitions, then re-create new ones. If permission/acls were set on the paths, the existing permission/acls will be deleted.\r\n\r\nWe should preserve the permission/acls if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. When truncate table/partition, Spark will keep permission/acls of paths.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nManual test:\r\n\r\n1. Create a table.\r\n2. Manually change it permission/acl\r\n3. Truncate table\r\n4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1) Added missing match case to SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler, so that it would not halt the process when the exception doesn't match any of the match case statements.\r\n2) Added log message before halting process.  During debugging it wasn't obvious why the Worker process would DEAD (until we set SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=1) due to the shell-scripts puts the process into background and essentially absorbs the exit code.\r\n3) Added SparkUncaughtExceptionHandlerSuite.  Basically we create a Spark exception-throwing application with SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler and then check its exit code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-30310, because the process would halt unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAll unit tests (mvn test) were ran and OK.","created_at":"2019-12-19T21:53:59Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T15:46:36Z","closed_at":"2020-01-17T15:46:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80ff6a5d95d3ba4088b011e7f3ab3973d8070f7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f9e96f6e95c9375920a6b9e8e85c03e88b5cb7b","head":{"label":"tinhto-000:uncaught_exception_fix","ref":"uncaught_exception_fix","sha":"3f9e96f6e95c9375920a6b9e8e85c03e88b5cb7b","user":{"login":"tinhto-000","id":46789425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Nzg5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46789425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000","html_url":"https://github.com/tinhto-000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinhto-000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"dea18231d499d57a717f7662ca3ce0eac7375425","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to extend Spark instrumentation to add metrics aimed at drilling down on the performance of Python code called by Spark: via UDF, Pandas UDF or with MapPartittions. Relevant performance counters, notably exuction time, are exposed using the Spark Metrics System (based on the Dropwizard library).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows to easily consume the metrics produced by executors, for example using a performance dashboard (this references to previous work as discucssed in https://db-blog.web.cern.ch/blog/luca-canali/2019-02-performance-dashboard-apache-spark ).\r\nSee also the screenshot that compares the existing state (no Python UDF time instrumentation) to the proposed new functionality ![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12989201/PandasUDF_Time_Instrumentation_Annotated.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR adds the PythonMetrics source to the Spark Metrics system. The list of the implemented metrics has been added to the Monitoring documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded relevant tests\r\n+ manually tested end-to-end on a YARN cluster and using an existing Spark dashboard extended with the metrics proposed here.","created_at":"2019-12-19T15:16:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T07:48:35Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T07:48:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04d532bd842d28e1e74757f243f411cafaf776b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen we reuse exchanges in AQE, what we produce is `ReuseQueryStage(QueryStage(Exchange))`. This PR changes it to `QueryStage(ReusedExchange(Exchange))`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue in `LocalShuffleReaderExec.outputPartitioning`. We can only preserve the partitioning if we read one mapper per task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`QueryStage` is light-weighted and we don't need to reuse its instance. What we really care is to reuse the exchange instance, which has heavy states (e.g. broadcasted valued, submitted map stage).\r\n\r\nTo simplify the framework, we should use the existing `ReusedExchange` node to do the reuse work, instead of creating a new node.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow parquet supports all the special characters that we were checking for previously. Initially parquet used to throw errors while using these special characters. So this validity check was introduced. Now parquet do not throw any exception for column names with special characters. \r\n\r\nIn JIRA also, one of user has pasted the output when creating parquet tables in pandas. There it supports special characters in column names.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now Users will be able to create parquet tables with special characters in column names.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually.\r\nWill add unit tests soon.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
