Description ##\r\nAs I was looking for a way to initialize the value of my weights to a given specific value, I couldn't find any straightforward way to do that without hacking into the parameters and setting the value directly. \r\nTurns out you can use the `mx.initializer.Constant`, even though the documentation stated that it can only accept scalar. If you give a NDArray of the right shape, you can initialize your weights using the `Constant` initializer, which is much cleaner than setting the data directly since you don't have to play around the names of the layers and parameters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are

Description ##\r\n\r\n[MXNET-342](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-342)\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9974\r\n\r\nDataLoader was not compatible with ImageRecordDataset as the file descriptors ~~was (probably) closed on forking (close_fds=True by default)~~. \r\n\r\nThe code in DataLoader use the `multiprocessing` package, which does not close the file descriptors, as it is simply calling `os.fork()`. The problem is that the recordIter is calling `lseek` on the file descriptors of each fork, all pointing to the same open file description. Since all the forked processes share the same open file description, they are all trying to set the value of `lseek` at the same time, thus creating a crash, as they can't be reading the same file at different position using a single open file description.\r\n\r\nsee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4277289/are-file-descriptors-shared-when-forking\r\nand https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11733481/can-anyone-explain-a-simple-description-regarding-file-descriptor-after-fork for more information of the distinction between `file descriptor` and `file description`\r\n\r\nNow it reloads the record in each worker so that each individual process gets its own open file description.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix a bug in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10580\r\nThe bug happens when an NDArray already has a MKLDNN memory with a special MKLDNN format. In some cases (group convolution), the MKLDNN memory uses 5 dimensions, while the NDArray still uses 4 dimensions. In this case, when GetMKLDNNData is called, SetMKLMem will discard the original MKLDNN memory due to incompatible dimensions between MKLDNN memory and NDArray. This messes up the data in the NDArray.\r\n\r\nThe test code in the PR can actually reproduce the bug in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10580\r\n\r\nThis PR also tries to add C++ unit tests to cover all possible combinations with getting MKLDNN memory from an NDArray.\r\n\r\nThank @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel for finding the root cause of this bug.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

Description ##\r\n\r\nWith the aim to removing the main navigation link to Gluon, these changes are to provide extra context around Module vs Gluon and rehome the information.\r\n\r\nGluon link in main navigation is out of place, and only provides links to a basic about page and an external website (which is unintuitive from a user perspective). Suitable location would be API docs, and this can then be linked to from other pages such as FAQ.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1) Moved content from Gluon/About (http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/gluon/index.html) to API/Python/Gluon (http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html)\r\n2) Added Module vs Gluon description to API/Python (http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-20T00:39:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T20:17:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T20:17:21Z","merged_at":"2018-05-03T20:17:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e68b3bc1579869fa9cef4e82b7132b8cb441b4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7bc07cb20f6cb50b90daeca406bbb3bf8aab275b","head":{"label":"thomelane:website_gluon","ref":"website_gluon","sha":"7bc07cb20f6cb50b90daeca406bbb3bf8aab275b","user":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120793163,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA3OTMxNjM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"thomelane/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nA refactor of the existing tutorial page.\r\n\r\n* Reworded the introduction.\r\n* Added more structure to the tutorials (nested hierarchy)\r\n* Moved Straight Dope to Python section.\r\n* Removed Selector for other languages.\r\n* Added external link icon.\r\n* Renamed some tutorials to have more consistent naming.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-20T00:32:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T19:46:13Z","closed_at":"2018-05-05T01:54:40Z","merged_at":"2018-05-05T01:54:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"97511ba943c436492ae044ae0de2046cd89621bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/eeda6f56953a2d4a72037b5b9ee187dccc0c493c","head":{"label":"thomelane:tutorials_page_shuffle","ref":"tutorials_page_shuffle","sha":"eeda6f56953a2d4a72037b5b9ee187dccc0c493c","user":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120793163,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA3OTMxNjM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"thomelane/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

(except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T17:51:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T15:29:22Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T00:03:03Z","merged_at":"2018-04-20T00:03:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ccd64787a05c6c04466ecfb0763b70ee8fbc988","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ec54d83ac963adf15c3f07bc39650ddb94142efb","head":{"label":"ZiyueHuang:std_sgd_update","ref":"std_sgd_update","sha":"ec54d83ac963adf15c3f07bc39650ddb94142efb","user":{"login":"ZiyueHuang","id":24650346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjUwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24650346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyueHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"615392bc8b9db6e8b3d589c12d59e7e5fba6fc1e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\n- Adding the tutorials to the CI\r\n- Adding a CI setting to set container shared memory size `--shm-size`\r\n- Adding a sanity check to tutorials:\r\n    - Every tutorial needs to be downloadable (except whitelist)\r\n    - Every tutorial needs to be tested (except whitelist)\r\n\r\nFuture improvements:\r\n- Currently, only sequential run (multiprocessing run is flaky and can leave orphan processes running)\r\n\r\n❄️ Flakiness:\r\n- cold image build -> Marco will improve the image build system\r\n     - ~~Scala install script~~ (fixed)\r\n     - R install script (?)\r\n- ~~`mldata.org` for MNIST data is flaky, failing the GAN tutorial ->using gluon dataset~~ (fixed)\r\n- ~~missing seed for sparse tutorial~~ (fixed)\r\n\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu , if you would like

to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nIt is not advised to upgrade a system pip package(install with debian package manager for example) to be upgraded by doing `pip install -U pip` (https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5221). I don't think we need this upgrade step here since MXNet installs fine with the pip version that is available after doing `sudo apt-get install python-pip`. Please see the PIP upgrade issue: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5221 . We ran into this issue when running the nightly tests.\r\nRemoved the upgrade step in this PR. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the docker disk-space leak which was caused by our CI constantly re-creating docker layers and invalidating the cache. The reason for this was that the ```nvidia-install``` script was executed after the uncacheable ```add_user``` script. This result in every single run creating a new layer. While this is usally no problem since the following layers are very small and compressed into a single layer, this caused problems if a big layer like ```Nvidia-install``` is being re-created during every single run.\r\n\r\nAlso, this speeds up the spin-up time of GPU build jobs. Considering the fact that the GPU build job is on our critical path, this will reduce the overall runtime of a CI job by about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Reduced disk-space consumption on Ubuntu CPU slaves\r\n- Higher execution speed of all jobs that build with CUDA.

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces global random number generators of numpy and python used in mx.image package with mxnet's random number generators. This is a sequel of PR #10260.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue with the nvcc path resolution logic in the Makefile (#10553).  In prior releases the makefile would use $(USE_CUDA_PATH)/bin/nvcc for nvcc no matter what was specified in config. For some users this was actually a good thing if 'nvcc' was not on the path, as it would specify the binary with an absolute path.  However the behaviour in the prior release caused issues when cross compiling. You may have an arm and x86 cuda path specified, and you need to select the correct nvcc for your platform.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks the configured nvcc to ensure it is actually on the path.  If it isn't it will set the binary to the absolute path.  This should match the behaviour of the prior release for users without nvcc on the path, and also allow for cross-compilation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Note on why this was missed in CI: we do not have any CUDA CI configurations that do not have nvcc on the path.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-16T21:22:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T20:09:12Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T20:09:12Z","merged_at":"2018-04-25T20:09:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c47098088880ba43681e34d1b2611ab067f4269","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4a79af5a57c6247fcc3f76002ac6f90651aac414","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:nvcc_fix_v1.2.0","ref":"nvcc_fix_v1.2.0","sha":"4a79af5a57c6247fcc3f76002ac6f90651aac414","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue with the nvcc path resolution logic in the Makefile (#10553).  In prior releases the makefile would use $(USE_CUDA_PATH)/bin/nvcc for nvcc no matter what was specified in config. For some users this was actually a good thing if 'nvcc' was not on the path, as it would specify the binary with an absolute path.  However the behaviour in the prior release caused issues when cross compiling. You may have an arm and x86 cuda path specified, and you need to select the correct nvcc for your platform.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks the configured nvcc to ensure it is actually on the path.  If it isn't it will set the binary to the absolute path.  This should match the behaviour of the prior release for users without nvcc on the path, and also allow for cross-compilation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Note on why this was missed in CI: we do not have any CUDA CI configurations that do not have nvcc on the

Description ##\r\nSupport elemwise_add/sub between dense and csr\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-320]\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\n- **+11** tutorials downloadable as jupyter notebooks and ready to integrate in the CI\r\n- Added <!--notebook-skip-line--> where necessary to beautify the notebooks\r\n- updated notebooks to remove `!bash`-like commands so they can run more easily on Windows\r\n- updated paths to be cross-platform\r\n- tested against master using the tutorial test runner (see log) on python 2 and python 3 (integration in CI coming up)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n```\r\nTest Summary Start\r\n31 tutorials

Description ##\r\nSupport parsing of int32 type in CSVIter\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-314]\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support integer data type in CSVIter\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nIn the past all parsers default to parse the files in real_t type, but when the files contain large integers we lose precision. e.g. 20000001 actually will have the same float32 representation as 20000000. To provide a way to accurately read the data for users who have such needs, we need to let the iterators be able to support parsing the input texts as integers.\r\nThis PR depends on dmlc/dmlc-core#388 to build work properly.\r\nComes together with a fix for flaky

Description ##\r\n\r\nChanged jetson build to cmake.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title does not start with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], since it's a minor change\r\n- [x] Changes are complete\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are not affected by this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added Ninja to possible generators when using CUDA\r\n- [x] Fixed passing CMAKE_C_FLAGS issue\r\n- [x] Disabled CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET override (actually I think this override should be removed completely, according to the manual this is [undefined behaviour](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET.html))\r\n- [x] Disabled OpenMP build from 3rdparty when cross compiling\r\n- [x] Made 1 cuda directory in the Docker image\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Tested on Jetson

Description ##\r\nNNPACK header files's position has changed,So the code also need to be updated. \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThe installation guide test used to pull a Cuda docker image from dockerhub and run tests inside this container. Earlier this test was running in cuda7.5 containers which had 'sudo' installed inside it. I changed this to cuda9 a couple of days back. \r\n\r\nHowever, the latest cuda docker images - `nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel` and `nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel` do not have `sudo` installed which is needed by the scripts in the mxnet installation page. \r\n\r\nHence I have created a simple docker image on the host called mxnet/base-cuda9 which only has the following - \r\n1. `nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel`\r\n2. `sudo`\r\n\r\nPlease Note: \r\n1. These tests are going to run on the official MXNet CI soon and these docker images will not be needed at that point since I plan to fix the script itself.\r\n2. The dockerfile and docker Image are only present on the Jenkins setup where this nightly test is running. Please add a comment below if you would like me to add this image to the MXNet dockerhub repo. \r\n\r\n\r\n@anirudh2290 This needs to go into 1.2 to make a nightly test pass. \r\n@gautamkmr @b0noI Can you please review!\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Created a new docker image on the slave where these nightly tests run, I can publish this image to dockerhub if needed. \r\n- [x] Changed the installation guide GPU tests to run in this new docker container\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-11T18:51:15Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T08:17:14Z","closed_at":"2018-04-12T00:32:25Z","merged_at":"2018-04-12T00:32:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"ceb810ccc17a712c375d55418a0ba45ae91714b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bd409a5f63003ea560390dddca2969c9705846e7","head":{"label":"mbaijal:docsneedbasedocker","ref":"docsneedbasedocker","sha":"bd409a5f63003ea560390dddca2969c9705846e7","user":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100059674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAwNTk2NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd all available .ipynb tutorials to the CI **(+13)**\r\nSome needed fixing, they are fixed now.\r\nCurrently runs successfully with python27 and python36 on linux\r\n\r\nAn upcoming PR will investigate the following issues:\r\n- [ ] Add an integration test to make sure all .ipynb files are tested\r\n- [ ] Enable multiprocessing tests to parallelize execution\r\n- [ ] Actually add the test suite to the nightly tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests on windows\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n```\r\n> python test_tutorial.py --kernel python2\r\nTesting

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-10T23:06:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-12T22:57:00Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T22:03:00Z","merged_at":"2018-04-11T22:03:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"549fd645181da4f7430ef0838d94071c1567e646","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/db50e9ad078bd0b236701e5a5400863e2bb61fe7","head":{"label":"zhreshold:slice-like","ref":"slice-like","sha":"db50e9ad078bd0b236701e5a5400863e2bb61fe7","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69486423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ4NjQyMw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"zhreshold/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdapted updated build scripts to the new Jenkins CI setup. This enables nightly docs builds.\r\n**Preview:** http://107.21.90.138/\r\n\r\nFixes #10238\r\nFixes #10226\r\nFixes #10273\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Trigger via Jenkins CI (currently pointing to my forks)\r\n    1. Use [Pipeline website build - test pipeline](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20pipeline/): this uses parameters from the UI so you can select which tag(s) to build, which tags should appear in the versions dropdown, which tag to be default (now master), and the domain (to facilitate dev server testing).\r\n    2. Then run [Project website build - test publish](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20publish/): this is mostly a clone from the previous site deploy Jenkins job; it deletes everything and grabs the artifacts from the build job and pushes those new files as a commit to the asf-site branch of mxnet-incubator-site.\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated [dependencies](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet/blob/1c08ec9b3b93a0a108e62ac4c21dfec9c7002274/ci/docker/install/ubuntu_docs.sh) for the docs Docker image\r\n- [x] Uses a [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet/blob/1c08ec9b3b93a0a108e62ac4c21dfec9c7002274/docs/Jenkinsfile) and [runtime_functions.sh](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet/blob/1c08ec9b3b93a0a108e62ac4c21dfec9c7002274/ci/docker/runtime_functions.sh) to call the [build_version_doc/build_all_version.sh](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet/blob/1c08ec9b3b93a0a108e62ac4c21dfec9c7002274/docs/build_version_doc/build_all_version.sh) to build the desired tags, then calls [update_all_version.sh](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet/blob/1c08ec9b3b93a0a108e62ac4c21dfec9c7002274/docs/build_version_doc/update_all_version.sh) to inject a variety of changes to the site versions. These are then saved as [artifacts.tgz](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20pipeline/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/).\r\n- [x] `update_all_version.sh` and `build_all_version.sh` now use IFS to delimit the tags by `;` since Jenkins has a hard time passing quotes downstream to the shell scripts.\r\n    * This means usage for dev builds will change like this to use semicolons: `./update_all_version.sh master;1.1.0;1.0.0 master http://localhost`\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n**How do you test this stuff?**\r\n1. Login to [Jenkins](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com).\r\n2. View the pipeline currently called [website build - test pipeline](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20pipeline/)\r\n3. Click **Build with Parameters**.\r\n4. Use the defaults, or change the domain to be your staging server's IP/DNS web address.\r\n5. Wait about 20-30 minutes while it builds the full site.\r\n6. On your staging server, clone my [mxnet site repo](https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet-site/).\r\n    - When you ran [website build - test pipeline](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20pipeline/) it followed up with [website build -test publish](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/website%20build%20-%20test%20publish/) which pushed the changes to my fork of [incubator-mxnet-site](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet-site).\r\n    - Make sure you `git pull` if you already had a clone of my fork.\r\n7. Copy the files to your webroot. For more info on this see the [developer instructions for docs build](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/docs/build_version_doc#serving-your-development-version).\r\n8. Preview the site on your staging server. Note, use the domain default before you try to use this for production, but using your own is helpful for QA'ing the site.\r\n\r\n## Production Steps ##\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is merged, both of the Jenkins jobs need to be updated to use production instead of my forks. Credentials for publishing to the production site repo will need to provided in the job's configuration. Note, don't change the names because the Jenkinsfile code for calling publish calls it by name.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The site deploy CI job should be converted to use Jenkinsfile instead of having script logic in the job itself. So that's a future TODO.\r\n- The publish job shouldn't delete the whole site repo. You should be able to just run master for a docs build and replace just master on the site. Another future TODO.\r\n- You should be able to run these scripts in the context of your current fork. At the moment they're hardcoded to checkout the project's main fork. This means that you can build the docs locally still with `make docs`, but you won't get to see all of the customizations that happen with the `update_all_version.sh` script. Another future TODO.\r\n- I'm seeing hardcoded problems: for current tag as default and the domain. These should be ferreted out as we test this new build structure. The site should work on a dev server perfectly, without directing to a hardcoded url. (Too often during testing you realize you're not on your dev server anymore, but on production.)\r\n- Artifacts could be handled better. We should investigate different plugins and artifacts strategies, so that we build smarter.\r\n- There's some waste on the Docker deps - these should probably be baked into an image and loaded on docker hub so that the jobs aren't reinstalling this stuff every time.\r\n- Jumping from the CI groovy script to shell is not the right pattern from what I can tell. Seems like these things should be refactored to be all in groovy and using built-in Jenkins functions.

Description ##\r\nIn this PR:\r\n\r\n- An inference benchmark script for SSD is added\r\n- Operator MultiBoxDetection is optimized to improve SSD performance on CPU\r\n- I tried to add a unit test for the consistency check between cpu and gpu but failed, since MultiBoxDetection on gpu cannot generate stable results for different run. I have raised a issue for this #10316. This code has past the consistency check with original cpu implementation.\r\n- Below performance is measured on skylake6148 with 2 sockets:\r\n\r\n`python benchmark_score.py`\r\nSSD-VGG16 with 20

Description ##\r\nThis updates MXNet to target Jetpack 3.2, which now targets CUDA9 and CUDNN 7.  It also fixes some packaging issues in the prior Jetson builds.  It's currently building using make, we'll likely have a follow up PR that converts this to cmake.  This PR was tested manually on a Jetson device.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-04-10T09:40:11Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T21:58:35Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T13:22:55Z","merged_at":"2018-04-10T13:22:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"0fd29698a11c0c77180aefdcf8264e063158a2c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3233818f39368dcb5f8b9ed2539bcfa88f337f6f","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:jetpack-3.2-make","ref":"jetpack-3.2-make","sha":"3233818f39368dcb5f8b9ed2539bcfa88f337f6f","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nUpdate gluon model_zoo links to training scrips. The old ones are pointing to forked repo.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-10T05:12:57Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T01:16:59Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T01:16:59Z","merged_at":"2018-04-11T01:16:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"65ff207e262c37ee6547ef3b4b76b66a98ecb78b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4ec81a6b552014ae9571d389ed5e41f6151cab8a","head":{"label":"zhreshold:fix-model-zoo-doc","ref":"fix-model-zoo-doc","sha":"4ec81a6b552014ae9571d389ed5e41f6151cab8a","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69486423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ4NjQyMw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"zhreshold/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
