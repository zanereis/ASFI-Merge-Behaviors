What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n The pr aims to upgrade `tink` from `1.14.1` to `1.15.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n- https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-java/releases/tag/v1.15.0\r\n  Use Conscrypt to verify RSA SSA PKCS1 signatures if it is available. This fixes a bug when Tink is used in FIPS-only mode and when using ConfigurationFips140v2.\r\n  Use Conscrypt for RSA SSA PSS signatures if it is available. RSA SSA PSS is now available when Tink is used in FIPS-only mode and when using ConfigurationFips140v2.\r\n  RsaSsaPssSignJce and RsaSsaPssVerifyJce now throw an exception if sigHash and mgf1Hash are not equal. This makes these functions consistent with the non-subtle API and with other languages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-02T01:43:18Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T23:17:24Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T23:17:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16122736114783d42d08e1eae0c978aa65574b6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be6bfe94329ae8d4cb93abbc10a6c488dedfe513","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-49486","ref":"SPARK-49486","sha":"be6bfe94329ae8d4cb93abbc10a6c488dedfe513","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nHandle null input for `SparkThrowableHelper.isInternalError` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `SparkThrowableHelper.isInternalError` method doesn't handle null input, and it could lead to NullPointerException. It happens when a `SparkException` without `errorClass` is invoked `isInternalError`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

on the first commit for fixing SPARK-49479 in branch 3.5: #47957\r\n-> This is the second commit for fixing SPARK-49479 in branch 3.5.\r\nThird commit for fixing SPARK-49479 in branch 3.5: #47956\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to replace `Timer` with single thread scheduled executor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe javadoc recommends `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` instead of `Timer`.\r\n![屏幕快照 2024-01-12 下午12 47 57](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8486025/4fc5ed61-6bb9-4768-915a-ad919a067d04)\r\n\r\nThis change based on the following two points.\r\n**System time sensitivity**\r\n\r\nTimer scheduling is based on the absolute time of the operating system and is sensitive to the operating system's time. Once the operating system's time changes, Timer scheduling is no longer precise.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor scheduling is based on relative time and is not affected by changes in operating system time.\r\n\r\n**Are anomalies captured**\r\n\r\nTimer does not capture exceptions thrown by Timer Tasks, and in addition, Timer is single threaded. Once a scheduling task encounters an exception, the entire thread will terminate and other tasks that need to be scheduled will no longer be executed.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor implements scheduling functions based on a thread pool. After a task throws an exception, other tasks can still execute normally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-31T05:00:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:15Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95b133979ad508a01550f202b1e589a61b4baaad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix the nullability of the `Base64` expression to be based on the child's nullability, and not always be nullable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47303 had a side effect of changing the nullability by the switch to using `StaticInvoke`. This was also backported to Spark 3.5.2 and caused schema mismatch errors for stateful streams when we upgraded. This restores the previous behavior which is supported by StaticInvoke through the `returnNullable` argument. If the child is non-nullable, we know the result will be non-nullable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nRestores the nullability of the `Base64` expression to what is was in Spark 3.5.1 and earlier.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSet the default value of CONNECT_SESSION_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE to 16 which was previously 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is a rare use case where a data frame is built from multiple dependent data frames, and while creating the last dependent data frame, all the other dependent data frames are invalidated from the plan cache, causing them to be analysed again. For this particular case, the performance of creating the data frame was improved from 41 minutes to 1 minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPerformance test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove cleanupResource() from`EmptyRelationExec`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46830 : `cleanupResources` might be executed on the executor where `logical` is null.\r\n\r\nAfter revisiting cleanupResources relevant code paths, I think `EmptyRelationExec` doesn't need to anything here.\r\n\r\n- for driver side cleanup, we have [this code path](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0602020eb3b346a8c50ad32eeda4e6dabb70c584/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala) to cleanup each AQE query stage.\r\n- for executor side cleanup, so far we only have SortMergeJoinExec which invoke cleanupResource during its execution, so upon the time when EmptyRelationExec is created, it's guaranteed necessary cleanup has been done.\r\n- \r\nAfter all, `EmptyRelationExec` is only a never-execute wrapper for materialized physical query stages, it should not be responsible for any cleanup invocation.\r\n\r\nSo I'm removing `cleanupResources` implementation from `EmptyRelationExec`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-29T12:29:20Z","updated_at":"2024-08-31T04:26:07Z","closed_at":"2024-08-31T02:05:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bcbd6d319a4deb6ad328c014954c4632b459ce5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b9ba70c9b89155bea76fdf4a1c469862145c93ab","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-49460","ref":"SPARK-49460","sha":"b9ba70c9b89155bea76fdf4a1c469862145c93ab","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds (java.util.zip.)CRC32C to `spark.shuffle.checksum.algorithm`. CRC32C has been supported by JDK since 9.\r\n\r\n>  /*\r\n     * This CRC-32C implementation uses the 'slicing-by-8' algorithm described\r\n     * in the paper \"A Systematic Approach to Building High Performance\r\n     * Software-Based CRC Generators\" by Michael E.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds support for size based partition creation during kafka read.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark structured streaming provides `minPartitions` config to create more number of partitions than kafka has. This is helpful to increase parallelism but this value is can not be changed dynamically. \r\n\r\nIt would be better to dynamically increase spark partitions based on input size, if input size is high create more partitions. With this change we can dynamically create more partitions to handle varying loads.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAn additional parameter(maxRecordsPerPartition) will be accepted on the Kafka source provider.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"940\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 11 13 27 AM\"

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark docs have always incorrectly scrolled to the right place when a hash fragment is specified in the URL: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"image\"

[Most browsers now support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-top#browser_compatibility) `scroll-margin-top`, which allows you to specify a margin that the browser will keep between the top of the element and the top-border of the viewport.\r\n\r\nIf a user's browser doesn't support this, their hyperlinks will be off by about ~80 pixels, which is no worse than the UX today.\r\n\r\nYou can play with the live changes [here](https://second-spark-site.vercel.app/). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore the change, `parse_json` will throw an error if there are duplicate keys in an input JSON object. After the change, `parse_json` will keep the last field with the same key. It doesn't affect other variant building expressions (creating a variant from struct/map/variant) because it is legal for them to contain duplicate keys.\r\n\r\nThe change is guarded by a flag and disabled by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the data migration simpler. The user won't need to change its data if it contains duplicated keys. The behavior is inspired by https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/super-configurations.html#parsing-options-super (reject duplicate keys or keep the last occurance).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe string-from-metadata and binary-from-metadata types were included in the initial spec, but never implemented for Spark 4.0 due to complexity and lack of a compelling use case. This PR removes them from the spec to align with the implementation. Nothing prevents us from adding these in the future, but Spark 4.0 would presumably not be able to read such a value, so having it in the spec at this point is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nClarifies Spark behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is a README-only change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-migration-guide.html#upgrading-from-spark-sql-34-to-35 states that `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning` is set by default, but that's currently not true, and causes confusion along with lost debugging time.\r\n\r\nNotably, when working with cached dataframes in Spark 3.5.0, I saw AQE not working until I manually set the flag myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis aligns the code with the documentation which prevents confusion. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, but nothing the documentation doesn't already state.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSimple config change. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-28T16:11:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T17:33:30Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T17:33:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ddc036e157c89c5d0289d5bd60294ae4562334a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/78029cb22323c5ed7e33caccf33c5d2350df24cf","head":{"label":"DennisJLi:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"78029cb22323c5ed7e33caccf33c5d2350df24cf","user":{"login":"DennisJLi","id":9292434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi","html_url":"https://github.com/DennisJLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":848902962,"node_id":"R_kgDOMpk7Mg","name":"spark","full_name":"DennisJLi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DennisJLi","id":9292434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi","html_url":"https://github.com/DennisJLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisJLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DennisJLi/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `spark.kubernetes.allocation.batch.delay` to prevent small values less than 100 from Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe default value is `1s` (=1000). Usually, a small value like `1` happens due to the missing unit, `s`, when users do mistakes. We had better prevent this. In addition, a misconfigured value like `1` can cause a high frequency traffic from Spark drivers to K8s control plan accidentally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor the misconfigured values, Spark will complain and fail from Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-28T15:39:11Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T02:47:18Z","closed_at":"2024-08-29T02:46:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06792d5d17bbd76dede4e22eeba4bbe5926a2a5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb05b2d90ed8002c163d1b7d8f63bb265fa4a48a","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49447","ref":"SPARK-49447","sha":"cb05b2d90ed8002c163d1b7d8f63bb265fa4a48a","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

Instead of PartitionPruning#prune is expected\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe code of method: prune in class: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.dynamicpruning.PartitionPruning is modified. And class: org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SQLConf has added a property value: DYNAMIC_PARTITION_PRUNING_MAX_LENGTH and a dynamicPartitionPruningMaxLength method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to address the issue of Spark's DynamicPartitionPruning generating plans with excessive character length and causing excessive memory usage leading to OOM errors when encountering too many levels of subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\nWhen DYNAMIC_PARTITION_PRUNING_ENABLED is set to true and DPP optimization is enabled, the generated execution plan may trigger a potential issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have provided test cases as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR prohibits casts from data types containing structs or maps to variant and introduces a new expression `to_variant_object` which allows converting nested types to variants and retains the old functionality. This PR also changes the behavior of the `schema_of_variant` and `schema_of_variant_agg` expressions where they now print `OBJECT` instead of `STRUCT` (which is not technically correct).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCast from structs to variant objects should not be legal since variant objects are unordered bags of key-value pairs while structs are ordered sets of elements of fixed types. Therefore, casts between structs and variant objects do not behave like casts between structs. Example (produced by Serge Rielau):\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT cast(named_struct('c', 1, 'b', '2') as struct<b int, c int>)\").show()\r\n+------------------------+\r\n|named_struct(c, 1, b, 2)|\r\n\r\n+------------------------+\r\n|{1, 2}|\r\n\r\n+------------------------+\r\n\r\nPassing a struct into VARIANT loses the position\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT cast(named_struct('c', 1, 'b', '2')::variant as struct<b int, c int>)\").show()\r\n+-----------------------------------------+\r\n|CAST(named_struct(c, 1, b, 2) AS VARIANT)|\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------+\r\n|{2, 1}|\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nCasts from maps to variant objects should also not be legal since they represent completely orthogonal data types. Maps can represent a variable number of key value pairs based on just a key and value type in the schema but in objects, the schema (produced by schema_of_variant expressions) will have a type corresponding to each value in the object. Objects can have values of different types while maps cannot and objects can only have string keys while maps can also have complex keys.\r\n\r\nWe should therefore prohibit the existing behavior of allowing explicit casts from structs and maps to variants as the variant spec currently only supports an object type which is remotely compatible with structs and maps. We introduce a new expression that converts schemas containing structs and maps to variants (where these types are converted to objects). We will call it `to_variant_object`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it introduces the `to_variant_object` expression and changes the behavior of the `schema_of_variant`/`schema_of_variant_agg` expressions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nSeveral unit tests with codegen enabled/disabled.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI propose to catch and rethrow runtime `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exceptions in the `UnivocityParser` class - `parse` method, but with more user-oriented messages. Instead of throwing exceptions in the original format, I propose to inform the users which csv record caused the error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nProper informing of users' errors improves user experience. Instead of throwing `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception without clear reason why it happened, proposed changes throw `SparkRuntimeException` with the message that includes original csv line which caused the error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces a user-facing change which happens when `UnivocityParser` parses malformed csv line with from the input. More specifically, the change is reproduces in the test case within `UnivocityParserSuite` when user specifies `maxColumns` in parser options and parsed csv record has more columns. Instead of resulting in `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` like mentioned in the HMR ticket, users now get `SparkRuntimeException` with message that contains the input line which caused the error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested in `UnivocityParserSuite`. Test named \"Array index out of bounds when parsing CSV with more columns than expected\" covers this patch. Additionally, test for bad records in `UnivocityParser`'s `PERMISSIVE` mode is added to confirm that `BadRecordException` is being thrown properly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`StringIndexer` sort arrays in executors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting implementation collect all arrays at driver, and then sort them with a `ForkJoinPool` via `ThreadUtils.parmap`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to move sorting from driver to executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI and manually test:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StringIndexer\r\n\r\nval numCol = 300\r\n\r\nval data = (0 to 10000).map { i =>\r\n  (i, 100 * i)\r\n}\r\nvar df = data.toDF(\"id\", \"label0\")\r\n(1 to numCol).foreach { idx =>\r\n  df = df.withColumn(s\"label$idx\", col(\"label0\") + 1)\r\n}\r\nval inputCols = (0 to numCol).map(i => s\"label$i\").toArray\r\nval outputCols = (0 to numCol).map(i => s\"labelIndex$i\").toArray\r\ndf.cache()\r\ndf.count()\r\n\r\nSeq.range(0, 10).foreach(i => new StringIndexer().setInputCols(inputCols).setOutputCols(outputCols).setStringOrderType(\"alphabetDesc\").fit(df)) // warm up\r\n\r\n\r\nval t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\nSeq.range(0, 10).foreach(i => new StringIndexer().setInputCols(inputCols).setOutputCols(outputCols).setStringOrderType(\"alphabetDesc\").fit(df))\r\nval t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\nprintln(\"Elapsed time: \" + (t1 - t0) / 1000000000.0 + \"s\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nmaster:\r\n```\r\nElapsed time: 12.181134084s\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis PR:\r\n```\r\nElapsed time: 11.432259833s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance is similar, the main change is that the sort happens in executors.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-08-28T04:40:45Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T00:28:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T00:27:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3859e38723401104fb19a7535291421c8496e98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14dc70f37d411c8a38e771db0cab2cef62d77570","head":{"label":"zhengruifeng:ml_si_dist","ref":"ml_si_dist","sha":"14dc70f37d411c8a38e771db0cab2cef62d77570","user":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51584791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU4NDc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengruifeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCompute all box plot metrics in single job\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nexisting implementation computes the necessary metrics step by step:\r\n1, compute q1/q3/mean/median;\r\n2, compute the whiskers: min and max values of non-outliers;\r\n3, get top 1k outliers;\r\n\r\nso it needs 3 jobs, however these metrics can be computed in single job:\r\n1, performance improvement: save ~20% computation time;\r\n2, simplify the implementation, to make it easier to reuse in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUptake `--bind-address` parameter in `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` when launching new container in Yarn cluster. This PR also ensure `YarnAllocator` uses default hostname when its not configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe've came across issue with Spark running on Yarn in Istio enabled Kubernetes cluster. Previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32633 is not merged because Spark 2.4 was EOL and 3.x branch didnt get enough traction.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new config specifically for Yarn cluster mode is added and relevant doc is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in Kubenetes with Istio and added tests to `YarnAllocatorSuite`\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2024-08-27T21:08:19Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T19:13:51Z","closed_at":"2024-08-27T21:37:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c41b7abb21fc9213d4cd7ac0017ff83116f3d79a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47896/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47896/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47896/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c9c2f42533123039f9794051599f3fe1eab50c1b","head":{"label":"gedeh:branch-3.5-yarn-executor-bind-address","ref":"branch-3.5-yarn-executor-bind-address","sha":"c9c2f42533123039f9794051599f3fe1eab50c1b","user":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369588765,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk1ODg3NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"gedeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh/spark","description":"Apache

The driver stores is locally. For the next batch, the State Store Checkpoint ID is sent to the executor to be used to load the state store. If the local version of the executor doesn't match the uniqueID, it will reload from the checkpoint.\r\n\r\nThere is no behavior change if the default checkpoint format is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is an incremental step of the project of a new RocksDB State Store checkpoint format. The new format is to simplify checkpoint mechanism to make it less bug prone, and fix some unexpected query results in rare queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new unit test is added to cover format version. And another unit test is added to validate the uniqueID is passed back and force as expected.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-08-27T18:32:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T21:07:45Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T04:53:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be57bd3ee39001ab3bf84faabfb9971534c5e529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdating collation benchmarks to compute relative time, instead of relative speed. Also, re-run all collation benchmarks (after introducing various perf improvements as part of the recent collation effort).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRelative speed is displayed in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUptake `--bind-address` parameter in `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` when launching new container in Yarn cluster. This PR also ensure `YarnAllocator` uses default hostname when its not configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe've came across issue with Spark running on Yarn in Istio enabled Kubernetes cluster. Previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32633 is not merged because Spark 2.4 was EOL and 3.x branch didnt get enough traction.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new config specifically for Yarn cluster mode is added and relevant doc is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in Kubenetes with Istio and added tests to `YarnAllocatorSuite`\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2024-08-27T14:00:12Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T20:28:51Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fe66443ffcf420cbb6decbf5db16cb171690cde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d013298e4e189d6918e41c1cf44d82ad88254ef","head":{"label":"gedeh:yarn-executor-bind-address","ref":"yarn-executor-bind-address","sha":"2d013298e4e189d6918e41c1cf44d82ad88254ef","user":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369588765,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk1ODg3NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"gedeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new message truncation strategy to limit the nesting level since the existing truncation strategies do not apply well to a deeply nested and large protobuf message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are instances where deeply nested protobuf messages cause performance problems on the client side when the logger is turned on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new test scenario to test_truncate_message in test_connect_basic.py.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-27T12:46:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T12:21:52Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T02:58:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"047e9fa05c540d3b62af2472c295af57c9603b31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/10afd92899355dfdf4125ce55b3a438c08ce4ccf","head":{"label":"changgyoopark-db:SPARK-49357","ref":"SPARK-49357","sha":"10afd92899355dfdf4125ce55b3a438c08ce4ccf","user":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":802238067,"node_id":"R_kgDOL9Eucw","name":"spark","full_name":"changgyoopark-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAddition of a test for `CreateTableAsSelect`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile looking through parameter marker support in statements it was noticed that CacheTableAsSelect actually should not work with parameter markers, but returns UNBOUND_SQL_PARAMETER. (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49398 ticket which should solve this issue). Because of this, I suggest adding additional test for `CreateTableAsSelect` to make sure all paths work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR is proposed to support Transpose as Scala/Python DataFrame API in both Spark Connect and Classic Spark. \r\n\r\nPlease see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSmG81qQ-muab0UOeqgDAELqF7fJTH8GnxCJF4Ir-kA/edit for a detailed design.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTransposing data is a crucial operation in data analysis, enabling the transformation of rows into columns. This operation is widely used in tools like pandas and numpy, allowing for more flexible data manipulation and visualization. \r\n\r\nWhile Apache Spark supports unpivot and pivot operations, it currently lacks a built-in transpose function. Implementing a transpose operation in Spark would enhance its data processing capabilities, aligning it with the functionalities available in pandas and numpy, and further empowering users in their data analysis workflows.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes Transpose is supported.\r\n\r\n**Scala**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+---+---+---+\r\n|  a|  b|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR creates a shared Dataset interface in `org.apache.spark.sql.api`, and it makes the Classic and Connect implementation extend this interface.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things to call out:\r\n- The documentation is mostly centralized in the shared interface. Implementations inherit these docs. I have checked the unidoc results and this works. \r\n- I have used self types to make methods that take a Dataset as an argument take the implementation as its argument. This makes the interface a tad cleaner, because this avoid defining the method twice. There is some scala magic happening in the background, but let's not talk about that :)...\r\n- This retains binary compatibility with the original implementation. We do this through the aforementioned self types and the use of covariant return types. This does effectively double the exposed API, for each method with a covariant return type (or a self type) there will be a version that uses the interface as its and argument and return type, and a version that uses the implementation as its argument and return type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are creating a unified Scala SQL Client Interface shared between Connect and Classic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. There is yet another change to the signature of broadcast. That - unfortunately - was already in a borked state.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport for timer in TransformWithStateInPandas Python API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo couple with Scala API, TransformWithStateInPandas should also support processing/event time timer for arbitrary state.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can now interact with timers from `handleInputRows` with two addtional parameters as:\r\n```\r\ndef handleInputRows(\r\n        self, key: Any, rows: Iterator[\"PandasDataFrameLike\"], \r\n          timer_values: TimerValues,\r\n          expired_timer_info: ExpiredTimerInfo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd user can interact with a newly introduce `TimerValues` to get processing/event time for current batch:\r\n```\r\nclass TimerValues:\r\n    def get_current_processing_time_in_ms(self) -> int\r\n\r\n    def get_current_watermark_in_ms(self) -> int\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can also interact with `expired_timer_info` to get the timestamp for expired timers:\r\n```\r\nclass ExpiredTimerInfo:\r\n    def is_valid(self) -> bool\r\n\r\n    def get_expiry_time_in_ms(self) ->\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests in `TransformWithStateInPandasStateServerSuite` and integration tests in `test_pandas_transform_with_state.py`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SimplifyConditionals` has a simplification code where if any of the (not first) branches in `CaseWhen` is `TrueLiteral` we remove all the remaining branches including the elseValue.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase CaseWhen(branches, ) if branches.exists(._1 == TrueLiteral) => // a branch with a true condition eliminates all following branches,\r\n// these branches can be pruned away\r\nval (h, t) = branches.span(_._1 != TrueLiteral)\r\nCaseWhen( h :+ t.head, None)\r\n```\r\nNow, the nullability check of CaseWhen checks that\r\n(1) either of the branches including elseValue is nullable or\r\n(2) elseValue is None.\r\n\r\nThe above simplification makes the elseValue as None. Combined with this nullability check makes the CaseWhen switch from non-nullable to nullable.\r\n\r\nThis ticket aims to fix this issue and remain the nullability of the expression by replacing the elsevalue to the value of the TrueLiteral expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee the section above \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` could potentially replace literals in the aggregate expressions with output attributes from the `Expand` operator. This can occur when a group-by expression is a literal that happens by chance to match a literal used in an aggregate expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1(a, b, c) as values\r\n(1, 1.001d, 2), (2, 3.001d, 4), (2, 3.001, 4);\r\n\r\ncache table v1;\r\n\r\nselect\r\n  round(sum(b), 6) as sum1,\r\n  count(distinct a) as count1,\r\n  count(distinct c) as count2\r\nfrom (\r\n  select\r\n    6 as gb,\r\n    *\r\n  from v1\r\n)\r\ngroup by a, gb;\r\n```\r\nIn the optimized plan, you can see that the literal 6 in the `round` function invocation has been patched with an output attribute (6#163) from the `Expand` operator:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\n'Aggregate [a#123, 6#163], [round(first(sum(__auto_generated_subquery_name.b)#167, true) FILTER (WHERE (gid#162 = 0)), 6#163) AS sum1#114, count(__auto_generated_subquery_name.a#164) FILTER (WHERE (gid#162 = 1)) AS count1#115L, count(__auto_generated_subquery_name.c#165) FILTER (WHERE (gid#162 = 2)) AS count2#116L]\r\n+- Aggregate [a#123, 6#163, __auto_generated_subquery_name.a#164, __auto_generated_subquery_name.c#165, gid#162], [a#123, 6#163, __auto_generated_subquery_name.a#164, __auto_generated_subquery_name.c#165, gid#162, sum(__auto_generated_subquery_name.b#166) AS sum(__auto_generated_subquery_name.b)#167]\r\n   +- Expand [[a#123, 6, null, null, 0, b#124], [a#123, 6, a#123, null, 1, null], [a#123, 6, null, c#125, 2, null]], [a#123, 6#163, __auto_generated_subquery_name.a#164, __auto_generated_subquery_name.c#165, gid#162, __auto_generated_subquery_name.b#166]\r\n      +- InMemoryRelation [a#123, b#124, c#125], StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n            +- LocalTableScan [a#6, b#7, c#8]\r\n```\r\nThis is because the literal 6 was used in the group-by expressions (referred to as gb in the query, and renamed 6#163 in the `Expand` operator's output attributes).\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, foldable expressions in the aggregate expressions are kept as-is.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome expressions require a foldable argument. In the above example, the `round` function requires a foldable expression as the scale argument. Because the scale argument is patched with an attribute, `RoundBase#checkInputDataTypes` returns an error, which leaves the `Aggregate` operator unresolved:\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Invalid call to dataType on unresolved object SQLSTATE: XX000\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Invalid call to dataType on unresolved object SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n\tat

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we have a scenario where if a version X is loaded (and there is an existing snapshot with version X), Spark will reuse the SST files from the existing Snapshot resulting in a VersionID Mismatch error. This PR fixes this issue, and simplifies RocksDB state management. The change eliminates the majority of shared state between Task thread and Maintenance thread, simplifying the implementation.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the task thread is now solely responsible for keeping track of the local files to DFS file mapping, the maintenance thread will not access this mapping. The DFS file names are generated at `commit()` - the generated snapshot, and the mapping containing the new SST files (with their generated DFS names) is handed over to the maintenance thread. The latest generated snapshot will be appended to a ConcurrentLinkedQueue (named snapshotsToUploadQueue). \r\n\r\nThe maintenance thread polls from the snapshotsToUploadQueue repeatedly until its empty. For the last snapshot polled out of the queue, the maintenance thread will upload the new SST files. The maintenance thread will also clear all removed snapshot objects from the disk.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes fix an issue where Spark Streaming fails with RocksDB VersionIdMismatch error if there is a existing snapshot (not yet uploaded) for RocksDB version being loaded. In this scenario, SST files from existing snapshot are reused resulting in a versionId Mismatch error. In short, these changes: \r\n\r\n1. Remove shared fileMapping between RocksDB Maintenance thread and task thread, simplifying the file mapping logic. The file Mapping is only modified from task thread after this change.\r\n2. Fixes the issue where RocksDB SST files from current snapshot (with same version) are reused, resulting in RocksDB VersionId Mismatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1. All existing testcases pass. \r\n2. Added new testcases suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47850/files, and ensure they pass with these changes. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe should not force users to implement these deprecated catalog plugin APIs, such as `TableCatalog#createTable` that tasks `StructType`. This PR adds default implementation for them which simply fails and asks to implement one of the methods.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.5.6, adding default implementation to an existing interface method is binary compatible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto simply catalog implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBox plot select outliers by distance from fences\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nif there are more than 1k outliers, existing implementations select the values by distance `|value - min(non_outliers)|` which is not reasonable because it prefers outliers above upper fence over outliers below lower fence.\r\nWe should order them by the distance from fences:\r\n1, if value > upper fence,  value - upper fence;\r\n2, it value < lower fence,  lower fence - value;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI and manually test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `podCreationTimeout` instead of `podAllocationDelay` when `getReusablePVCs` excludes the newly created PVCs of previous batches.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nK8s control plane pod creation can be delayed due to the unknown reasons. So, `podAllocationDelay (default: 1s)` is insufficient to say that the previous allocation batch's pods are created with their PVCs. We had better wait until `podCreationTimeout`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis affects only the initial set of executors because the baseline is PVC's `getCreationTimestamp`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThese changes break the Structured Streaming Programming Guide into smaller sub-pages **without changing any content**. You can see a preview of it [here](https://nr-spark-site.vercel.app/).\r\n\r\nI broke up the pages by `h1` tag; within pages, the sub-sections on the left menu are broken up by `h2`. The SS programming guide now will resemble the SQL programming guide and the MLLib programming guide.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to avoid cluttering the top-level namespace (there are dozens of `sql-*` files for the SQL reference), we nest all streaming docs in by one directory, namely the `/streaming/`. This has the side-effect of breaking links from our `_layouts`, since we assume a flat top-level namespace. To fix this issue, URLs in global layout files now all use absolute paths.\r\n\r\nThis move to `/streaming/` has the consequence that bookmarks of `https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html` will not refer to the actual programming guide content. In anticipation of this, I have kept all pages for existing URLs present with links to the pages in their new locations. This includes the new state data source and the Kafka integration guide.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we'll be able to quite easily (and in-parallel) break the programming guide apart further. This PR does all of the plumbing to make it work.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eca87d4-9fb7-453c-a74a-20bd5c504d87)\r\n\r\nIt is future work to fix the oddly-sized left-navigation bar for our menus.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of the major hurdles that users have with Structured Streaming is that our guide is exceptionally long—it feels insurmountable, especially compared to other engines like Flink, which has many sub-pages.\r\n\r\nGoogle also has a very tricky time indexing the single large page; if you Google \"[structured streaming output mode](https://www.google.com/search?q=structured+streaming+output+mode)\" and you click on the link to our programming guide... nothing happens. You aren't taken to the actual content, since Google has trouble with indexing to specific heading tags.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe structure of the website, with respect to Structured Streaming-related pages, is now changed. See the earlier parts of the PR description for the specific changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, **no** content is changed. This should make reviewing the changes much easier.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have used automated tools (e.g. [Lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee)) and manual verification (i.e. clicking on every link) to make sure that I didn't break any links. It isn't fool-proof, though.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-25T15:02:27Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T09:52:59Z","closed_at":"2024-08-30T09:52:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6838b487edb9f7efcbc9135aceac3969a55b6767","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40db58c762e85145cc159128e1b3ed4f28c6f1ee","head":{"label":"neilramaswamy:nr/streaming-guide-breakapart","ref":"nr/streaming-guide-breakapart","sha":"40db58c762e85145cc159128e1b3ed4f28c6f1ee","user":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":688675173,"node_id":"R_kgDOKQxZZQ","name":"nr-spark","full_name":"neilramaswamy/nr-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy/nr-spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids `ArrayTransform` in `resolveArrayType` function if the resolution expression is the same as input param.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOur customer encounters significant performance regression when migrating from Spark 3.2 to Spark 3.4 on a `Insert Into` query which is analyzed as a `AppendData` on an Iceberg table.\r\nWe found that the root cause is in Spark 3.4, `TableOutputResolver` resolves the query with additional `ArrayTransform` on an `ArrayType` field. The `ArrayTransform`'s lambda function is actually an identical function, i.e., the transformation is redundant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids `ArrayTransform` in `resolveArrayType` function if the resolution expression is the same as input param.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOur customer encounters significant performance regression when migrating from Spark 3.2 to Spark 3.4 on a `Insert Into` query which is analyzed as a `AppendData` on an Iceberg table.\r\nWe found that the root cause is in Spark 3.4, `TableOutputResolver` resolves the query with additional `ArrayTransform` on an `ArrayType` field. The `ArrayTransform`'s lambda function is actually an identical function, i.e., the transformation is redundant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies `ProtobufFunctionsSuite`'s test case `SPARK-49121: from_protobuf and to_protobuf SQL functions` to check the stop index depending on the file path length.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDuring debugging CI failure in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47843, we found that `ProtobufFunctionsSuite`'s test case `SPARK-49121: from_protobuf and to_protobuf SQL functions` is environment-dependent.\r\nIn the test, it checks the start and stop indices of SQL text fragment but the fragment length depends on the repo name of the author of a PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, test only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove `maven.scaladoc.skip` from the `scala-maven-plugin`'s global configuration to its `attach-scaladocs` execution's configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`maven.scaladoc.skip` was added in SPARK-43461 to speed up the `dev/make-distribution.sh` by skipping scaladocs generation, but it was wrongly applied to a broader scope.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt affects developers who use `build/mvn deploy -Dmaven.scaladoc.skip=true` to deploy the artifacts case, without this patch, wrong `<module>-tests.jar`s (don't contain the test classes but only resources) will be produced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dmaven.scaladoc.skip=true -pl core

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the code in the connect server module which refers gRPC lite classes and restores `grpc-protobuf-lite` scope from \"compile\" back to \"runtime\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\ngRPC/protobuf provides both standard and lite runtimes, which should not be mixed up, connect server currently uses the standard runtime, should avoid accessing the lite class directly.\r\n\r\nAs [grpc-java v1.61.0 release notes](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.61.0) said \r\n\r\n> Change many compile deps to runtime deps (https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/commit/d6830d7f99ac7e5afb8b75100f0432151d4705e8). This reduces the transitive classes \"leaked\" into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (`io.grpc.internal`) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-46919 we upgraded the gRPC from 1.59.3 to 1.62.0, and had to manually expose \"io.grpc:grpc-protobuf-lite\" to the compile scope to make the build happy, which breaks the original intention of gRPC deps management.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GHA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-23T15:42:53Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T01:04:54Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T01:04:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8218fd8a4acb5c75a9936f490fdbe94994646712","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4e513ed4e0047c74855a10fc77b151aea5458f1","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-49368","ref":"SPARK-49368","sha":"d4e513ed4e0047c74855a10fc77b151aea5458f1","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

author: @amuraru\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to support add memory based thresholds for shuffle spill.\r\n\r\nIntroduce configuration\r\n- spark.shuffle.spill.maxRecordsSizeForSpillThreshold\r\n- spark.sql.windowExec.buffer.spill.size.threshold\r\n- spark.sql.sessionWindow.buffer.spill.size.threshold\r\n- spark.sql.sortMergeJoinExec.buffer.spill.size.threshold\r\n- spark.sql.cartesianProductExec.buffer.spill.size.threshold\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24618\r\n\r\nWe can only determine the number of spills by configuring `spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold`. In some scenarios, the size of a row may be very large in the memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA\r\n\r\nVerified in the production environment, the task time is shortened, the number of spill disks is reduced, there is a better chance to compress the shuffle data, and the size of the spill to disk is also significantly reduced.\r\n\r\n**Current**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6e172b8-0da8-4b60-b456-024880d0987e\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n24/08/19

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, in the test case \"SPARK-49121: from_protobuf and to_protobuf SQL functions\", for the test case where the `fragment` contains the `testFileDescFile` variable, we also use an absolute position to define `ExpectedContext#stop`. \r\n\r\nHowever, since the content of `testFileDescFile` is related to both the build tool and the execution directory of the test case, its length is not fixed. \r\n\r\nFor example, the maven daily test failed\r\n\r\n- Java 21: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/10509632076/job/29116303271\r\n- Java 17: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/10508648823/job/29113000899\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-49121: from_protobuf and to_protobuf SQL functions *** FAILED ***\r\n  150 did not equal 153 Invalid stopIndex of a query context. Actual:SQLQueryContext(Some(3),Some(2),Some(10),Some(150),Some(\r\n  SELECT\r\n    to_protobuf(complex_struct, 42, '/home/runner/work/spark/spark/connector/protobuf/target/generated-test-sources/functions_suite.desc', map())\r\n  FROM protobuf_test_table\r\n  ),None,None) (SparkFunSuite.scala:376)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand when I run the test locally using `sbt`, it also failed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"protobuf/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.protobuf.ProtobufFunctionsSuite\"\r\n[info] - SPARK-49121: from_protobuf and to_protobuf SQL functions *** FAILED *** (248 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   165 did not equal 153 Invalid stopIndex of a query context. Actual:SQLQueryContext(Some(3),Some(2),Some(10),Some(165),Some(\r\n[info]   SELECT\r\n[info]     to_protobuf(complex_struct, 42,

(SparkFunSuite.scala:376)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this PR changes ExpectedContext#stop to a relative definition: stop = (start - 1) + prefixLength + fileNameLength + suffixLength\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n...\r\nqueryContext = Array(ExpectedContext(\r\n          fragment = s\"to_protobuf(complex_struct, 42, '$testFileDescFile', map())\",\r\n          start = 10,\r\n          stop = 153))\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n(start - 1) = 10 -1 = 9\r\nprefixLength = \"to_protobuf(complex_struct, 42, '\".length = 33\r\nsuffixLength = \"', map())\".length = 9\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the `stop` definition  will change from `stop = 153`  to `stop = 9 + 33 + fileNameLength + 9`, similar change have been made to other cases as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake the test more robust and fix the maven daily test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- locally

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParallelize the KDE computation for `plotly` backend.\r\n\r\nNote that `matplotlib` backend is not optimized in this PR, due to the computation logic is slightly different between `plotly` and `matplotlib`:\r\n1, `plotly`: compute a global `ind` across all input columns, and then compute all curves based on it;\r\n2, `matplotlib`: for each input column, compute its `ind` and then the curve;\r\n\r\nI think `matplotlib`'s approach seems more reasonable, but it make this optimization cannot be directly applied on `matplotlib`, so it needs more investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nexisting implementation compute each curve once, this PR aims to compute multiple columns together\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI and manually test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-23T06:57:02Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T01:44:58Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T01:11:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5acecf93ab68124bec0184b6a605ad3ec8cd2d31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS
