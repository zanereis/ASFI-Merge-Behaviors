Description ##\r\nThis PR is a \"follow-up\" of previously merged https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10764 .\r\nIn this PR, we are covering:\r\n1.  Refine the cases on nn.Conv2D and change the input shape to hit the MKLDNN code path (Done);\r\n2.  Adding more test cases cover other gluon layers, like BN, Dense/FC, Pooling etc. from the \"MKLDNN-specialty\" perspective. (WIP)\r\n  \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAll the changes is reflected by tests/python/mkl/test_mkldnn.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n1. For the correctness check on gluon computation, it follows the design used by tests/python/unittest/test_gluon.py, and therefore, the helper functions defined in tests/python/unitest/common.py is also

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in multibox_detection operator. According to operator documentation, only topk detections are kept before NMS, but the cpu operator doesn't clear the unnecessary detections after detection sort. On the other hand, the gpu operator is correctly implemented.\r\n\r\n@zhreshold, I have already made an [issue](https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet-ssd/issues/206) in mxnet-ssd repo.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nimplement string key variant for KVStore in cpp-package\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nSee [full design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Scala+API+Usability+Improvement)\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\nThis PR is the Addition for new NDArray functions of Scala API\r\nWarning: current PR expose underscore functions\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Use QuasiQuote to replace original API Implementation (Reduce lines)\r\n- [x] MakeAtomicFunction change to support String type parameter type in\r\n- [x] User New namespace for New API (temporarily NDArray.api.function_name)\r\n- [x] Default args using None to pass in as default\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-02T22:51:10Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T18:43:20Z","closed_at":"2018-05-23T18:43:20Z","merged_at":"2018-05-23T18:43:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0d632f7ed9d59508e01e391fbe111ec5d1d2edd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f35893a61969993f0f9080ecda360be3f5df1185","head":{"label":"lanking520:ndarray-macros-impl","ref":"ndarray-macros-impl","sha":"f35893a61969993f0f9080ecda360be3f5df1185","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nAn example of differentially private deep learning using `mxnet.gluon` and `pydiffpriv`.\r\nThe module `dpdl_utils.py` might have some independent interest, when one needs to work with parameters and gradients of a model directly as ndarrays. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does.\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- More examples will be added to it in the next update.\r\n- The module `dpdl_utils.py` might be of independent interest. It bridges the gap between python the gluon-style model parameters: `mxnet.gluon.ParameterDict`  and the *from scratch* version: that simply uses a list of `mxnet.ndarray`s.  `dpdl_utils.py` contains utility functions necessary to manipulate the parameters and the corresponding gradients in ParameterDict using generic ndarray operations.

Description ##\r\n\r\nspecify common arch for mkldnn build, so it can be reused on all arch\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-01T23:20:26Z","updated_at":"2018-06-30T20:33:29Z","closed_at":"2018-06-30T20:33:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c91f3253dab4014c6f40db76c2452abf26f6df21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bf67ba0080bcb5a7134bc8a398259e76bc5beb72","head":{"label":"ashokei:mkldnn_build_arch_flag","ref":"mkldnn_build_arch_flag","sha":"bf67ba0080bcb5a7134bc8a398259e76bc5beb72","user":{"login":"ashokei","id":29638935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjM4OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29638935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei","html_url":"https://github.com/ashokei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102439218,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDI0MzkyMTg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ashokei/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashokei","id":29638935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjM4OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29638935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei","html_url":"https://github.com/ashokei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashokei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashokei/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nWhen using the kvstore on a single device, no copy of the source array would be created when pushing to the kvstore. When row sparse pulling from the kvstore, this would lead to a deadlock as both source and target arrays were identical. For now this PR removes the optimization of not creating a copy.\r\n\r\nThanks @eric-haibin-lin for helping to find the

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces more test cases to cover the gluon computation on MKLDNN with ndarray related memory operations, such as slice, reshape etc. I am also implementing more test cases covering more gluon computations involving MKLDNN (such as BN, pooling etc.), and will be reflected in standalone PR(s) accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAll the changes is reflected by tests/python/mkl/test_mkldnn.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n1. For the correctness check on gluon computation, it follows the design used by tests/python/unittest/test_gluon.py, and therefore, the helper functions defined in tests/python/unitest/common.py is also used.\r\n2. A minor change on the existing test case in same source file is just addressing the additional module import supporting the newly added test cases.","created_at":"2018-05-01T13:35:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T04:40:14Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T17:49:42Z","merged_at":"2018-05-01T17:49:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f42f2cd3123cd57007f25e8dcc5f5ed4d3af457","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2e91f40961e8958572fada77ea230e98a2891c5b","head":{"label":"juliusshufan:tc","ref":"tc","sha":"2e91f40961e8958572fada77ea230e98a2891c5b","user":{"login":"juliusshufan","id":33112206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTEyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33112206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan","html_url":"https://github.com/juliusshufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130635774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA2MzU3NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"juliusshufan/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliusshufan","id":33112206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTEyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33112206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan","html_url":"https://github.com/juliusshufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliusshufan/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis patch fixes a singed/unsigned bug in the implementation of the spatial transformer bilinear sampling code; in particular in the backward pass.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the computed `data_index` wants to take negative numbers for cases when the interpolation lookup falls out of the source window. This is bad on 64-bit machines as the test for hitting the source window still works but once the the 32-bit unsigned number is added to the 64-bit pointer things break with a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Fixes bug in spatial transformer bilinear interpolation backward

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix a bug in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10580\r\nThe bug happens when an NDArray already has a MKLDNN memory with a special MKLDNN format. In some cases (group convolution), the MKLDNN memory uses 5 dimensions, while the NDArray still uses 4 dimensions. In this case, when GetMKLDNNData is called, SetMKLMem will discard the original MKLDNN memory due to incompatible dimensions between MKLDNN memory and NDArray. This messes up the data in the NDArray.\r\n\r\nThe test code in the PR can actually reproduce the bug in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10580\r\n\r\nThis PR also tries to add C++ unit tests to cover all possible combinations with getting MKLDNN memory from an NDArray.\r\n\r\nThank @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel for finding the root cause of this bug.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

Description ##\r\nAdd cuda archs for Jetson TX1 and TX2\r\n\r\nNote also that one needs to add USE_F16C=0 to the make options to get this to work on Jetson. Suggest to add this to the MXnet installation documentation. Currently, people with TX1/TX2 would follow the given instructions, and are greeted with compile errors, and then spend a lot of time on StackOverflow. Here's the magic incantation version for TX1/TX2 with JetPack 3.2 (16.04) with CUDA 9.0, just leaving this on GitHub comments in hopes that people googling \"mxnet jetson compile error\" will find this comment:\r\nmake -j $(nproc) USE_OPENCV=1 USE_BLAS=openblas USE_CUDA=1 USE_CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda USE_CUDNN=1 USE_F16C=0\r\n\r\nThat USE_F16C=0 needs to be done in addition to the cuda arch additions in this commit below.\r\n\r\n(Suggestion: I wish all this F16C stuff were automatically detected and would \"just work\" ... especially on TX1/TX2, some of NVIDIA's most popular pieces of hardware ... people trying to work on ML shouldn't have to spend time dealing with installation problems. Ideally would be nice if it were officially supported to just be able to sudo pip3 install mxnet-cu90==1.2.0 on a TX2 and start deploying models within

Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support broadcast_add/sub between csr matrices and 1D dense vector\r\n- [x] Corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nBenchmark Results:\r\n([CSR density %] [Speed-up rate without fallback] [Speed-up rate with fallback])\r\n(256, 1M) * (256, 1) broadcast_add:\r\n1.00%&nbsp;

Description ##\r\nUse sort in dot(csr.T, dense) to ensure deterministic result. \r\nAfter benchmarking with synthetic uniform sparse data, the performance is almost the same as the previous version. Below please find the script. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\nBenchmark script:\r\n```\r\ndef measure_cost(repeat, f, *args, **kwargs):\r\n

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nSee [full design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Scala+API+Usability+Improvement)\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\nThis PR is the Addition for new NDArray functions of Scala API\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Use QuasiQuote to replace original API Implementation (Reduce lines)\r\n- [ ] MakeAtomicFunction change to support String type parameter type in\r\n- [ ] User New namespace for New API (temporarily <Functioname>New)\r\n- [ ] Default args using None to pass in as default\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nwe need to invalidate the MKLDNN arrays when they are reused as output arrays. We have done it in the symbolic executor. We need to do the same thing in the imperative execution.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\n\r\nWe extend MXNet distributed training by adding one new type of kvstore (dist_sync_allreduce).\r\nIn this type of kvstore, since there's no parameter server, we replace original kvstore apis push and pull with one single api pushpull. We also add one api broadcast to broadcast the weight in root rank to other nodes. You can refer API Spec part in the design doc for details. We created a  new thread on each node to sync and do allreduce through mpi. \r\nCurrently, we implement the CPU part and leave the place holder to GPU. It's easy to extend to GPU part with mpi support or nccl v2 support. \r\n\r\nFollowing is the design doc\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4anwDiS18cWP49FAghU6tqqdtnRKUcbNJJxvhIfvIA/edit#heading=h.t762l56r1094\r\n\r\n## Performance and Accuracy\r\nFor Performance, our testing environment: Machine: SKX6148, Network: 10GbE, Topology: VGG16, Local Batch Size: 64 Single Node FPS: 27.3 (pic/second)\r\n<img width=\"481\" alt=\"performance-allreduce\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20310371/39390275-be929a70-4ac4-11e8-83a5-669dcd83acf8.png\">\r\nFor Accuracy, we compared top-1 and top-5 accuracy curve between 4 P100 GPU (with original kvstore dist_device) and 4 SKX6148 CPU (with new kvstore dist_sync_allreduce).

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-25T02:12:00Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T18:30:04Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T18:30:04Z","merged_at":"2018-04-25T18:30:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"50c8d6a33083ab2b9aa0f9fb1df211a19b62c576","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/82f9a8ae35cd421b9ee30534302d9df6a7f9e013","head":{"label":"rasefon:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"82f9a8ae35cd421b9ee30534302d9df6a7f9e013","user":{"login":"rasefon","id":1701259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDEyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1701259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon","html_url":"https://github.com/rasefon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130814070,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA4MTQwNzA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"rasefon/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rasefon","id":1701259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDEyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1701259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon","html_url":"https://github.com/rasefon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasefon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rasefon/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFixes asymmetric padding issue in onnx-mxnet translators. MXNet conv operator supports only symmetric padding, whereas the conv operator in ONNX can have asymmetric padding. We are fixing this discrepancy by sequencing MXNet's 'Pad' operator and MXNet's 'Convolution' operator. Because the 'Pad' operator in MXNet supports asymmetric padding.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage: The 'Pad' operator has tests for both symmetric and asymmetric padding.\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- @spidyDev @anirudh2290 @zheng-da

Description ##\r\nAs I explained in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10663, there is mismatch between MXNet and ONNX. This is a temp fix from the MKLDNN side for the problem: MKLDNN conv follows the behavior of MXNet conv (always uses the first two elements in the tuple as padding). \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nSee [full design document](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Scala+API+Usability+Improvement)\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\nThis PR is the Addition for new Symbol functions of Scala API\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Use QuasiQuote to replace original API Implementation (Reduce lines)\r\n- [x] MakeAtomicFunction change to support String type parameter type in\r\n- [x] User New namespace for New API (temporarily Symbol.api.function_name)\r\n- [x] Default args using None to pass in as default\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFor non-MKLDNN operators, providing an MKLDNN array triggers fallback. In this case, the input array and the output array are no longer using the same memory even if the output requirement is write-inplace. For operators that handle write-inplace differently, this can potentially cause problems, as spotted in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9835\r\n\r\nThe fix in this PR is to change the original output requirement to WriteTo. @piiswrong is this an acceptable fix?\r\n\r\nThank @ashokei for finding the root cause of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9835\r\nThe code below can trigger the problem.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\nfrom mxnet import nd\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nnet = gluon.nn.HybridSequential()\r\nwith net.name_scope():\r\n    net.add(gluon.nn.Conv2D(channels=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))\r\n    net.add(gluon.nn.Flatten())\r\n    net.add(gluon.nn.Dense(10))\r\nnet.hybridize()\r\nctx = mx.cpu(0)\r\nnet.collect_params().initialize(mx.init.Xavier(magnitude=2.24), ctx=ctx)\r\nx=nd.array(np.ones([32,3,224,224]), ctx)\r\ny=net(x)\r\nz=y[0].asnumpy()\r\nprint(z[0:5])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nFor https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10509 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9782.\r\n\r\nFor test, I have run matrix factorization with momentum sgd when `lazy_update=False` on GPU.\r\n\r\ncc @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

--gpus, it assumed the script will run on CPU, while actually the device is not correctly set to mx.cpu()\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- example/gluon/image_classification.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-23T04:42:10Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T17:26:13Z","closed_at":"2018-04-30T17:26:13Z","merged_at":"2018-04-30T17:26:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d7505a96d536dd88800ad5228cc7d7241ef13e8","assignee":{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/377b34065d74004ab80551589322d1d81d4b2b39","head":{"label":"juliusshufan:gluon-example","ref":"gluon-example","sha":"377b34065d74004ab80551589322d1d81d4b2b39","user":{"login":"juliusshufan","id":33112206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTEyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33112206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan","html_url":"https://github.com/juliusshufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130635774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA2MzU3NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"juliusshufan/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliusshufan","id":33112206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTEyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33112206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"h
