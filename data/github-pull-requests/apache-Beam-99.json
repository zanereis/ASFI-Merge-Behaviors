design (and implementation) of `SnsIO.writeAsync` is broken both with respect to the beam programming model as well as general async programming:\r\n\r\n- Output for a bundle may be emitted even after the bundle is finished (lack of join / waiting for pending futures), additionally output is emitted from multiple threads risking concurrent modification issues on underlying data structures.\r\n- Exceptions disappear into the void (respective tests are broken as they don't throw asynchronously and could make one think this works).\r\n- Parallelism is unlimited causing the writer to instantly accumulate everything into memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n`BEAM-13563` will allow to later change `SnsIO.write` into an async implementation without any breaking changes. That should be the right time to implement things throughly and address above issues.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

1.4.0 changes the logic used for [transform detection](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v1.4.0.html#groupby-apply-consistent-transform-detection), which breaks our implementation of `apply`. Specifically, detecting transforms using index equality _does not work_ for Beam DataFrames, since it requires observing the actual index values at pipeline construction time. In addition, the fact that pandas does it breaks some of our internal usages since some partitions can have equal indexes, and other partitions can have unequal indexes, leading to results that are different between partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies our implementation of `apply` so that it does _not_ defer to pandas' `apply` when it's transform detection will lead to inconsistent results. It also documents this new divergence from pandas (i.e. our `apply` implementation will never detect a transform via index equality).\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

correctly runs setup-go before some of our java and python tests. The previous iteration had 2 issues that caused it to not work:\r\n\r\n1) The matrix strategy was incorrectly specified as:\r\n\r\n`runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n```\r\nruns-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\r\nstrategy:\r\n  fail-fast: false\r\n  matrix:\r\n    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(in fairness, I found at least 1 place where the docs on this were wrong)\r\n\r\n2) Putting the setup-go step in its own job won't actually impact anything because new runners are spun up for each job if we're using the hosted service\r\n\r\nThis corrects both of those things and adds setup-go back in\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

eager artifact materialization for automated expansion service queries, avoiding leaking resources when used and allowing the service to be torn down after the `Expand()` call. This is achieved by adding a new `HandlerFunc` to manage this and logic in `getHandlerFunc()` to pass it back when needed. The SQL transform wrapper is modified to use this functionality when no expansion address is provided, and the written SQL example in the repository passes using this approach.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the service start-up code depends on the Beam version found in `core/core.go` and the Beam version must be a non-dev release version with published JARs on Maven.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

back a stripped down contribution guide. Not having this was a small piece of friction on getting started with my first contribution - it used to exist, and was removed (possibly mistakenly - https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10366#issuecomment-573992574).\r\n\r\nHaving an explicit CONTRIBUTING.md makes a couple discoverability things easier, mostly it would:\r\n\r\n1) Help new contributors find the guide more quickly (extra helpful for people who don't necessarily need to read through the beam model, e.g. users, and people who are actively making their first contributions and want to reference it quickly)\r\n\r\n2) Use GitHub's built in support to link the contribution guide when users open their first pr.\r\n\r\n3) If we switch to issues, automatically point to the contribution guide when/before users create their first issue as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nSee the [Contributor Guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute) for more tips on [how to make review process smoother](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-reviewers-job-easier).\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

replaces probot autolabeling with a GitHub Action to do the same. Probot has been deprecated and hasn't been labeling PRs in a while, but the config already exists to do it. Having this would be nice so that we can quickly answer questions like: what are all of the Go PRs that have been completed recently. This is extra nice for new contributors (like me) who are trying to find their way around the repo/recent changes.\r\n\r\nNote that because the Action uses slightly different glob matching I had to update the patterns in autolabeler.yml\r\n\r\nHere's an example PR where the labeler is working - https://github.com/damccorm/beam/pull/1\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/151863356-9faf8f17-6e4e-40d4-a80a-50737affc943.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change allows users to submit multiple pipelines to the same SDK container without dependency conflicts. Dependencies in `--setup_only` mode are still installed globally.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the deployment cycle looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. Worker pool is spawned (PID 1 in SDK container => worker pool ID = `1`).\r\n2. Flink starts a job and a worker gets spun up with ID `1-1`.\r\n3. The worker creates a temporary venv in `/opt/apache/beam-venv/beam-venv-worker-1-1` and deploys the artifact with dependencies.\r\n4. Processing happens ...\r\n5. Everything is cleaned up and a new job can be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe venvs are bound to individual workers (or sets of workers if they have siblings) and are cleaned up as soon as they finish. This makes `multiProcessExactlyOnce()` obsolete, so it was removed. Additional care was taken to ensure a clean signal flow between individual components, so anything that would cause a premature `os.Exit()` or a `SIGKILL` to be sent was adjusted to allow for clean worker shutdown.\r\n\r\nfixes: #21123\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

original algorithm of the DetectNewPartitions is susceptible to failures, because it produces side effects on every try which is not  idempotent. Specifically, it marks the partitions as SCHEDULED in the Spanner database and outputs them. If there is a bundle commit failure, during retry, the already SCHEDULED partitions will not be picked up again.\r\n\r\nWe change the algorithm in this PR to always schedule partitions that have a created at timestamp greater than the one saved in the DetectNewPartitions restriction. When scheduling the partitions, this SDF will also claim the created at of such partitions, advancing the timestamp saved. If there is a bundle commit failure, the restriction timestamp won't be saved, thus the partitions in the bundle will be picked up again regardless of their state.\r\n\r\nMore information can be seen

dataflow.go runner currently requires a project to be set via a flag. However, this can be inferred from the users config if they have set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var to point to a service account ([details here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#auth-cloud-explicit-go)). This updates the runner to respect that setting if a project is not explicitly supplied.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the dataflow runner creates collisions if two jobs are created at the same microsecond. \r\n\r\nThis change adds eight random alphanumeric characters to the end of the job name, which increases the number of simultaneously started jobs required for collision odds to be over 50% from 2 (as they would definitely collide now) to 2 million. \r\n\r\nThis change also updates the unit test to account for the new name format. \r\n\r\nR: @TheNeuralBit \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR changes how we stage packages mentioned in the `--requirements_file`. Prior to this, the default behavior was to download the source distributions of the packages specified in the `--requirements_file` during staging. The current behavior would be to download binary distributions(wheels) for packages specified in the `--requirements_file` without their sub-dependencies. To follow the prior behavior, set `--requirements_cache_only_sources`.  Staging of the packages/pipeline dependencies can be skipped by setting `--requirements_cache=skip` during job submission.\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
