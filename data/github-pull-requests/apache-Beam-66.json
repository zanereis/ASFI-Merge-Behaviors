M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model.

M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model. Additional improvements include accelerated add+matmul linear algebra kernels for sizes commonly used in Transformer models and Nested Tensors is now enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timely deprecating older CUDA versions allows us to proceed with introducing the latest CUDA version as they are introduced by Nvidia®, and hence allows support for C++17 in PyTorch and new NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Previously, functorch was released out-of-tree in a separate package. After installing PyTorch, a user will be able to <code>import functorch</code> and use functorch without needing to install another package.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PyTorch is offering native builds for Apple® silicon machines that use Apple's new M1 chip as a beta feature, providing improved support across PyTorch's APIs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stable</th>\n<th>Beta</th>\n<th>Prototype</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Better Transformer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 CI/CD Deprecation <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enable Intel® VTune™ Profiler's Instrumentation and Tracing Technology APIs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Extend NNC to support channels last and bf16<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Functorch now in PyTorch Core Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beta Support for M1 devices<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arm® Compute Library backend support for AWS Graviton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> CUDA Sanitizer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can check the blogpost that shows the new features <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/blog/PyTorch-1.13-release/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Backwards Incompatible changes</h1>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model. Additional improvements include accelerated add+matmul linear algebra kernels for sizes commonly used in Transformer models and Nested Tensors is now enabled by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timely deprecating older CUDA versions allows us to proceed with introducing the latest CUDA version as they are introduced by Nvidia®, and hence allows support for C++17 in PyTorch and new NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Previously, functorch was released out-of-tree in a separate package. After installing PyTorch, a user will be able to <code>import functorch</code> and use functorch without needing to install another package.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PyTorch is offering native builds for Apple® silicon machines that use Apple's new M1 chip as a beta feature, providing improved support across PyTorch's APIs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stable</th>\n<th>Beta</th>\n<th>Prototype</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Better Transformer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 CI/CD Deprecation <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enable Intel® VTune™ Profiler's Instrumentation and Tracing Technology APIs<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Extend NNC to support channels last and bf16<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Functorch now in PyTorch Core Library<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beta Support for M1 devices<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n<td><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arm® Compute Library backend support for AWS Graviton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> CUDA Sanitizer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can check the blogpost that shows the new features <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/blog/PyTorch-1.13-release/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Backwards Incompatible changes</h1>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model.

#25030 \r\n\r\nWe have observed that some UDFs(with bugs or imported some bad third-party libs) could hang the runner and SDK harness processes in Samza portable mode. Both runner and SDK harness processes are in a zombie state and have no data processing in this case, however, the processes are not able to be shut down although Samza runner provides some built-in timeout functionality.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow the users to set a timeout for closing a remote bundle in Samza portable runner. Once the timeout occurred, the runner and SDK processes will be shut down properly by Samza's built-in task timeout functionality if enabled.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#25018 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `withDefaultHeaders` setting to the ElasticsearchIO ConnectionConfiguration. This allows you to provide any type of `org.apache.http.Header` instead of sticking to the built-in `ApiKey` and `Bearer` headers supported already. In a way, their functionality could be implemented using this option instead if desirable.\r\n\r\nThis addresses #25018 - it allows to create a custom class implementing `org.apache.http.Header` that manages the bearer token lifecycle and use this with ElasticsearchIO - this all without imposing any specifics in the ElasticsearchIO library.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, the datastore intersphinx_dependency is breaking our [docs job](https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_PythonDocs_Cron/). This seems to be because the docs were migrated from `https://googleapis.dev/python/datastore/latest/` to `https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/datastore/latest/` with a redirect, and the new url is not compatible with the sphinx tooling we're trying to use (I tried upgrading Sphinx and avoiding the redirect, but neither fixed the issue).\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, I removed the datastore dependency. It has caused us trouble in the past multiple times ([example](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8286)), and doesn't provide a ton of value, plus I don't see a clear path around the current problems. Removing it will cause links like the one associated with `google.cloud.datastore.key.Key` in https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1new.types.html#apache_beam.io.gcp.datastore.v1new.types.Key to no longer be automatically generated. We don't have many of those for datastore anyways, and they're trivial to lookup. Basically, this is a nice to have that is keeping our docs from functioning correctly, so cutting it seems like the right move to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #24976\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

creates a new `SchemaTransformProvider` implementation that supports Spanner's Change Streams API. Why is this valuable?\r\n\r\n- The PTransform returns a PCollection with a schema equivalent to the schema of the table that we are consuming.\r\n- The SchemaTransformProvider can be used for a cross-language transform\r\n\r\nSomething that this transform does: It runs a local pipeline in the DirectRunner to fetch the table schemas from Spanner for when we build the pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nr: @nancyxu123 \r\n\r\nPlease note that this makes public a few different classes in the Spanner package. Let me know if that's okay, or if I should try to do something else.\r\n\r\nAlso, qq: How do y'all handle upper/lower case column names? They seem to be somewhat inconsistent : /\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#21065\r\n\r\nThis will allow retries when start_upload fails, which otherwise will prevent potential data loss.\r\n\r\nTwo things I'm a little uncertain about is the TODO comment previously mentioned to refactor this function to allow retries, and that the underlying library allows retries, but 1. Am I understanding it correctly that I can just refactor it by simply adding the `@retry.with_exponential_backoff` or is there something more? 2. I don't see the retry logic in the `Insert` functions, but maybe it's deeper than that? \r\n\r\nI'm a Python newbie so these things are not clear to me :/\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

In some unavoidable situations a release may be delayed or released early or a language may skip a release altogether and do the next release to catch up with other languages. See the past releases in the links above. A six-week cycle gives us a good balance between delivering new features/fixes quickly and keeping the release overhead low.</p>\n<p>The gRPC release support policy can be found <a href=\"https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/faq/#how-long-are-grpc-releases-supported-for\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Releases are cut from release branches. For Core and Java repos, the release branch is cut two weeks before the scheduled release date. For Go, the branch is cut just before the release. An RC (release candidate) is published for Core and its dependent languages just after the branch cut. This RC is later promoted to release version if no further changes are made to the release branch. We do our best to keep head of master branch stable at all times regardless of release schedule. Daily build packages from master branch for C#, PHP, Python, Ruby and Protoc plugins are published on <a href=\"https://packages.grpc.io/\">packages.grpc.io</a>. If you depend on gRPC in production we recommend to set up your CI system to test the RCs and, if possible, the daily builds.</p>\n<p>Names of gRPC releases are <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/g_stands_for.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Release</th>\n<th>Scheduled Branch Cut</th>\n<th>Scheduled Release Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.17.0</td>\n<td>Nov 19, 2018</td>\n<td>Dec 4, 2018</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.18.0</td>\n<td>Jan 2, 2019</td>\n<td>Jan 15, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.19.0</td>\n<td>Feb 12, 2019</td>\n<td>Feb 26, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.20.0</td>\n<td>Mar 26, 2019</td>\n<td>Apr 9, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.21.0</td>\n<td>May 7, 2019</td>\n<td>May 21, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.22.0</td>\n<td>Jun 18, 2019</td>\n<td>Jul 2, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.23.0</td>\n<td>Jul 30, 2019</td>\n<td>Aug 13, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.24.0</td>\n<td>Sept 10, 2019</td>\n<td>Sept 24, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.25.0</td>\n<td>Oct 22, 2019</td>\n<td>Nov 5, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.26.0</td>\n<td>Dec 3, 2019</td>\n<td>Dec 17, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.27.0</td>\n<td>Jan 14, 2020</td>\n<td>Jan 28, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.28.0</td>\n<td>Feb 25, 2020</td>\n<td>Mar 10, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.29.0</td>\n<td>Apr 7, 2020</td>\n<td>Apr 21, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.30.0</td>\n<td>May 19, 2020</td>\n<td>Jun 2, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.31.0</td>\n<td>Jul 14, 2020</td>\n<td>Jul 28, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.32.0</td>\n<td>Aug 25, 2020</td>\n<td>Sep 8, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.33.0</td>\n<td>Oct 6, 2020</td>\n<td>Oct 20, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.34.0</td>\n<td>Nov 17, 2020</td>\n<td>Dec 1, 2020</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.35.0</td>\n<td>Dec 29, 2020</td>\n<td>Jan 12, 2021</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>v1.36.0</td>\n<td>Feb 9, 2021</td>\n<td>Feb 23, 2021</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/0a82c02a9b817a53574994374dcff53f2e961df2\"><code>0a82c02</code></a> Bump v1.51.x to 1.51.1 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc/issues/31740\">#31740</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/27428be7345035a5a5fc55c25a867aa259071732\"><code>27428be</code></a> Revert &quot;Build with System OpenSSL on Mac OS arm64 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc/issues/31096\">#31096</a>)&quot;

M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model.

#21410 adding AvroReadSchemaTransform and AvroWriteSchemaTransform. As a port of the SchemaIO version it does not attempt to change any of the semantics of SchemaIO (e.g. unbounded inputs will be split on a minute boundary by default). Locally there are appear to be some failing tests, but they are not the test I added so creating a pull request to see if it's universally the case that something is broken (perhaps due to other commits)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a retry policy to publish messages in case of connection closed\r\n\r\nFixes #24971\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Amrane Ait Zeouay <122456352+amranezeRenault@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\nWhen trying to publish messages using `JmsIO` with a closed/failed connection, the messages are not published and lost. We will need to get the failed messages with the function `getFailedMessages` and try again and again multiple times. \r\n\r\n````java\r\nvar failedPublishedMessages = messages.apply(getWriter(sinkOptions)).getFailedMessages();\r\nvar refailedPublishedMessages = failedPublishedMessages.apply(REPUBLISH_FAILED_MESSAGE_NAME, getWriter(sinkOptions)).getFailedMessages();\r\n....\r\nreturn PDone.in(cdpMessages.getPipeline());\r\n````\r\n\r\nTo not have multiple steps for retrying the failed publication, we added a `Retry Policy` which consist on retrying the publication n times (the number is given by the user) until the timeout (given by the user too) is finished. Also, we added a predicate function, to give the user the option to handle when the connection should be reconnected or not in case of a failed connection.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of #22303\r\n\r\nKafka performance test starts failing again after #24879 in. This is because we removed shuffle=appliance there and then read from shuffle becomes faster.

It is out of the Playground scope, but this is required for Tour of Beam, and it is easier to maintain only a single version of Analytics in both projects.\r\nIn this PR only Playground is migrated, and for ToB some TODOs are inserted. They will be resolved in\r\n- https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25466\r\nSome work on ToB is there because we initially wanted to work only on it and keep Playground intact, and it is easier to not cut that ToB work now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
