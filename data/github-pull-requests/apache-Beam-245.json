sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis replaces the case dispatch on the Java SDK's `Trigger` type with a case dispatch on the Runner API's `Trigger` type. This is a step towards `runners/core-java` executing triggers from any language.\r\n\r\nThis also attempts to mitigate unresolved discussions around \"reshuffle\" by translating the unofficial `ReshuffleTrigger` (a hack so that a runner can know that the trigger is part of a Reshuffle operation) to an official \"Always\" trigger, since the meaning is the same.\r\n\r\nOnce users have another way of creating an \"Always\" trigger it will not be safe to assume it is inside a Reshuffle. The alternative is getting rid of all special casing based on the trigger, and do something based on the transform instead. This is just a tech debt payback that I am

I am opening the PR for comment anyhow, but there are  few changes that I might now make underneath this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Move Java SDK `ClosingBehavior` to top level and rename. Incidentally related to [BEAM-210](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-210) only because that is another reason this should just be a top-level concept. Not sure there's much benefit to putting public enums inside other misc classes when there's no real natural home for them.\r\n2. Move Java SDK `AccumulationMode` to top level and put its to/from proto there. In particular, it should also come out of `util`.\r\n3. Maybe actually try to move from `OutputTimeFn` to a Java SDK `OutputTime` prior to this PR. But actually converting this to proto, then converting the runners to use that will make the latter migration easier. Some cruft is introduced in the meantime, though.\r\n4. If `WindowingStrategy` is going to continue to be a thing that is prominent all over our public SDK surface and in the runner API whether it really belongs in `util`.\r\n5. I don't actually do the necessary things to share components yet.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll want to flesh out the list of test cases. Given how generic the logic is, I don't expect many surprises.\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis includes the entirety of #2000, which unified `FunctionSpec`. The diff was so small that it is trivial to do both in one review. (they were separate because of hang-ups that led to #1990, but are now resolved).\r\n\r\nThis is just barely more than an automated refactor.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes to unify `FunctionSpec`:\r\n\r\n - The `FunctionSpec` proto is arranged just slightly differently due to observations by both @tgroh and @robertwb about starkly separating SDK-specific bits from universal bits. Specifically:\r\n   - The \"pass the serialized blob\" SDK-specific path is represented by `SdkFunctionSpec`\r\n   - The \"specify the function via a URN and parameters\" path is represented by `UrnWithParameters`\r\n    - The harness uses a bit of both. IMO this reflects the existing design so I would like to defer any refinements to this, though I definitely want the feedback.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes to unify `Coder`:\r\n\r\n - Moved a coder's local id out of the `Coder` itself and into the key of a map in `ProcessBundleDescriptor`. Philosophically, the id is an essential aspect of `ProcessBundleDescriptor` (or `Pipeline`) but not not an essential aspect of a coder.  Pragmatically, this allows the Runner API and the Fn API to key the map on different types (`string` and `int64` respectively). Prospectively, it makes it easy to construct instances of the message that are \"just values\" without any id, which is aesthetically pleasing and more flexible to more uses.\r\n - Inlined the `SdkFunctionSpec` in `Coder` in the Runner API. Having it by reference introduces a needless sharing of key type and adds needless overhead, since coders are already stored by reference, as are environments.\r\n\r\nR: @dhalperi

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis ports the Fn API and the Java SDK's Fn harness to use the `FunctionSpec` from the Runner API, aka the function spec that will be part of the user's submitted pipeline. At some point we might want yet a third `sdks/common/common` :-) library for things that are shared but for now minimizing administrative overhead. (p.s. that is why I like more specific names)\r\n\r\nThe proto is arranged just slightly differently due to observations by both @tgroh and @robertwb that the \"pass the serialized blob\" SDK-specific path and the \"specify the function via a URN and parameters\" path should be starkly separated.\r\n\r\nThe changes I made to the Java SDK harness are really just one step beyond automated refactor. I think some of the ways that the SDK-specific payload look like measures of expedience prior to this PR; I did not try to improve them.","created_at":"2017-02-13T22:25:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T23:57:18Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T04:52:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9882328aeebe1d6af9bb3f2d2aa704801bd4acd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4e7865b828eae962532f1759833eed8b0e769cc9","head":{"label":"kennknowles:fn-api-functionspec","ref":"fn-api-functionspec","sha":"4e7865b828eae962532f1759833eed8b0e769cc9","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror
