MySQL JDBC Driver versions prior to 8.0.28 have TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 enabled, which can result in connection attempts throwing an `SSLException` when running Apache NiFi on versions of Java that disable those deprecated TLS protocol versions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to TLS protocol negotiation issues, the `CaptureChangeMySQL` Processor does not support the option to configure JDBC connection properties. Updating the Processor to set MySQL JDBC connection properties based on the `SSL Mode` selected provides a more intuitive configuration and improves support for TLS negotiation using certificates issued by private certificate authorities.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages several [MySQL Connector Security Properties](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-connp-props-security.html) that have been deprecated, but remain supported. This approach enables compatibility with a wide range of MySQL JDBC Driver versions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9374](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9374) Adds a `DeprecationLogger` interface with standard implementation and factory to provide a common approach to logging deprecated components and features.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-deprecation-log` module has a single dependency on the SLF4J API to provide the logging implementation.\r\n\r\nThe `DeprecationLogger` interface has a single `warn()` method that should be sufficient for general use across components. The `DeprecationLoggerFactory` and `StandardDeprecationLogger` implementation prefix logger names with `deprecation`, enabling discrete logging to a separate appender.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a new `nifi-deprecation.log` enables a standard approach for administrators to determine whether an installation of Apache NiFi is using components or features that will be removed in future releases. Log messages should indicate deprecated properties or capabilities, and a standard internal `DeprecationException` provides a reference to the classes and methods calling the deprecated elements.\r\n\r\nThe initial set of changes includes updates to `NiFiLegacyCipherProvider` providing example usage. The Cipher Provider supports the legacy Sensitive Properties Algorithm configuration values from Apache NiFi 1.13.2 and earlier. Deprecation logs can be observed by configuring a legacy algorithm such as `PBEWITHMD5AND256BITAES-CBC-OPENSSL`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10300](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10300) Adds `AzureEventHubRecordSink` as a record sink service for supporting transmission of record-oriented events to Azure Event Hubs using the `PutRecord` processor. Similar to `PutAzureEventHub`, the `AzureEventHubRecordSink` service uses the Azure Event Hubs client library and supports configurable authentication strategies. Also adds `TestAzureEventHubRecordSink` for basic implementations of unit tests. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10350](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10350) Corrects NiFi Registry user authorization determination when authenticating using OpenID Connect.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation refreshes the Registry Configuration after successful username and password authentication with LDAP or Kerberos, but does not refresh the configuration after OIDC authentication.\r\n\r\nThe solution moves the Registry Configuration refresh to the shared `checkLogin` functions, which incorporate a ticket exchange request to an OIDC provider when configured. This approach ensures that the user interface has the current Registry Configuration regardless of the authentication strategy.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10322](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10322) Corrects path attribute building when sending the `Set-Cookie` header to remove the `__Secure-Authorization-Bearer` Cookie as part of HTTP 401 Unauthorized response processing.\r\n\r\nWhen access Apache NiFi through a proxy server that provides access through a prefixed path, the HTTP response processing does not append a `/` character to the `path` attribute to the `Set-Cookie` as part of the 401 Unauthorized response handling. The initial login process does append the `/` character to the `path` attribute, resulting in a mismatch between the initial addition of the Cookie and the later request to remove the Cookie from browser storage. As a result of failing to remove the Cookie from browser storage, the browser continues to send an expired JSON Web Token, resulting in an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.\r\n\r\nChanges include setting the root path in the `RequestUriBuilder`, following the same pattern used in application REST resources, and updating unit tests to verify the expected path for both the default root path as well as a forwarded root path.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

is a draft PR of adding the property encryptor module. I would like input on the general approach, any issues with naming, or suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this can be run by building and running:\r\n\r\n`java -cp \"./target/nifi-property-encryptor-tool-1.18.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar:~/.m2/repository/info/picocli/picocli/4.5.2/picocli-4.5.2.jar:~/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-simple/1.7.36/slf4j-simple-1.7.36.jar:~/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.36/slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar:../../nifi-commons/nifi-property-protection-factory/target/nifi-property-protection-factory-1.18.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\"  org.apache.nifi.util.console.PropertyEncryptorCLI encrypt config /tmp/encrypt-me aSecurePassphrase AES_GCM`\r\n\r\nthough it seems the references to maven repository may need to be absolute rather than using tilde. I have not yet determined how to build the picocli application to run more like a bash script but that is the end goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR should encrypt configuration files with AES_GCM - other providers have not yet been added. Also still to add is encrypting the nifi.properties (which should be an additional commit to this PR) and encrypting the flow.xml.gz/flow.json.gz which might be a separate PR. Currently it is also writing out the encrypted files as temporary files, without overwriting the existing ones. I think I will instead add some changes to this PR to copy the old files to .bkup and rename the encrypted files. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10318](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10318) Corrects the TLS client authentication configuration settings in `HandleHttpRequest` to call `setWantClientAuth()` instead of `setNeedClientAuth()` based on the selected Client Authentication property configuration.\r\n\r\nChanges for NIFI-3869 introduced a problem with the TLS connector configuration, setting the value of `needClientAuth` based on the Client Authentication property setting of `Want Authentication`. As a result of this problem, setting `Need Authentication` for the Client Authentication property in `HandleHttpRequest` is not honored.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

[WebClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html). The `WebClientService` and associated components support composition and execution of HTTP requests using standard or custom HTTP methods. The `WebClientService` supports synchronous request execution.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-web-client-api` module also provides an `HttpUriBuilder` interface to abstract composition of a `java.net.URI` based on component elements.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-web-client` module provides a standard implementation of these interfaces using [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/). The `StandardWebClientService` class supports configuration of common settings, such as timeouts, TLS, and proxy access.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-web-client-api` and `nifi-web-client` modules under `nifi-commons` provide the foundation for a new Controller Service interface named `WebClientServiceProvider` defined in `nifi-web-client-provider-api`. The `StandardWebClientServiceProvider` implementation in `nifi-web-client-provider-service` enables components to define a reusable service configuration for HTTP communication.\r\n\r\nThis approach follows the pattern of the Proxy Configuration Service, allowing Processors to abstract HTTP socket configuration. The `nifi-web-client-api` and `nifi-web-client-provider-api` also provide a layer of abstraction for components that require HTTP components. This narrows the scope of impact for dependency upgrades and allows components to implement HTTP communication without depending on a particular HTTP library.\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation is self-contained with a number of unit tests using OkHttp MockWebServer. Runtime integration can be tested with scripted components, and further improvements can be implemented in subsequent pull requests as necessary. The purpose of this pull request is to provide the foundational implementation for additional development efforts.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

controller service to use <br />for parsing the incoming data and determining the schema. | null          | true      |\r\n| Schema        | The schema that IoTDB needs doesn't support good by NiFi.<br/>Therefore, you can define the schema here. <br />Besides, you can set encoding type and compression type by this method.<br />If you don't set this property, the inferred schema will be used.<br /> It can be updated by expression language. | null          | false     |\r\n| Aligned       | Whether using aligned interface?  It can be updated by expression language. | false         | false     |\r\n| MaxRowNumber  | Specifies the max row number of each tablet.  It can be updated by expression language. | 1024          | false     |\r\n\r\n### Inferred Schema of Flowfile\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of rules about flowfile:\r\n\r\n1. The flowfile can be read by `Record Reader`.\r\n2. The schema of flowfile must contains a field `Time`, and it must be the first.\r\n3. The data type of time must be `STRING` or `LONG`.\r\n4. Fields excepted time must start with `root.`.\r\n5. The supported data types are `INT`, `LONG`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TEXT`.\r\n\r\n### Convert Schema by property\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, converting schema by property which is more flexible and stronger than inferred schema. \r\n\r\nThe structure of property `Schema`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"timeType\": \"long\",\r\n\t\"field\": [{\r\n\t\t\"tsName\": \"root.sg.d1.s1\",\r\n\t\t\"dataType\": \"INT32\",\r\n\t\t\"encoding\": \"RLE\",\r\n\t\t\"compressionType\": \"GZIP\"\r\n\t}, {\r\n\t\t\"tsName\": \"root.sg.d1.s2\",\r\n\t\t\"dataType\": \"INT64\",\r\n\t\t\"encoding\": \"RLE\",\r\n\t\t\"compressionType\": \"GZIP\"\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\n1. The first column must be `Time`. The rest must be arranged in the same order as in `field` of JSON.\r\n1. The JSON of schema must contain `timeType` and `fields`.\r\n2. There are only two options `long` and `string` for `timeType`.\r\n3. The columns `tsName` and `dataType` must be set.\r\n4. The tsName must start with `root.`.\r\n5. The supported `dataTypes` are `INT32`, `INT64`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`, `TEXT`.\r\n6. The supported `encoding` are `PLAIN`, `DICTIONARY`, `RLE`, `DIFF`, `TS_2DIFF`, `BITMAP`, `GORILLA_V1`, `REGULAR`, `GORILLA`.\r\n7. The supported `compressionType` are `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY`, `GZIP`, `LZO`, `SDT`, `PAA`, `PLA`, `LZ4`.\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n\r\n| relationship | description                                          |\r\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| success      | Data can be written correctly or flow file is empty. |\r\n| failure      | The shema or flow file is abnormal.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-3964](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3964) Updates the `Groks Patterns` property in `ExtractGrok` and `GrokReader` to support `TEXT` and `URL` resources, enabling direct specification of custom patterns in the property value, as well as external file locations.\r\n\r\nThe change in both components retains the current `Grok Patterns file` property name for compatibility, but adds a display name value of `Grok Patterns` to reflect more generalized capabilities. Additional changes include new unit tests to illustrate property value specification of a custom pattern.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10284](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10284) Corrects HTTP request authenticated user logging in `nifi-request.log`.\r\n\r\nMoving the `HeaderWriterFilter` after `RequestAuthenticationFilter` in `StandardRequestFilterProvider` ensures that `RequestAuthenticationFilter` receives the Jetty `Request` object, which `RequestAuthenticationFilter` requires to set the authenticated user for logging. Changes include updating the unit test for `StandardRequestFilterProvider` to verify that `RequestAuthenticationFilter` is the first filter configured when HTTPS is enabled.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10269) Upgrades H2 database dependencies from 2.1.210 to [2.1.214](https://h2database.com/html/changelog.html).\r\n\r\nH2 2.1.214 changed the specific exception class from `JdbcSQLNonTransientException` to `JdbcSQLNonTransientConnectException` when encountering an older version of the database file structure, but retained the same exception message and wrapped exception cause. Instead of catching the specific exception class, the catch block now handles the more generalized `SQLNonTransientException`. This change to Apache NiFi `H2DatabaseUpdater` maintains the current approach to handle and ignore this specific exception scenario, allowing upgrades from earlier versions of NiFi that depend on H2 1.4.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10265](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10265) Updates `PutDatabaseRecord` to route FlowFiles to the `failure` relationship when failing to retrieve a JDBC Connection from the Database Connection Pool Service.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior calls `DBCPService.getConnection()` outside of the general try-catch block. As a result of this approach, any exceptions thrown from `getConnection()` cause incoming FlowFiles to remain in the queue, instead of being processed. The adjustment moves `getConnection()` inside the try-catch block so that exceptions, such as network connection failures, will cause FlowFiles to be routed to the `failure` relationship.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adding a unit test for the condition and updating the unit test class to JUnit 5.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

double-quote\r\nappearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with\r\nanother double quote.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes current functionality which removes starting and ending double quotes.\r\nFor example input string is \"\"\"Test\"\"\"\r\ncurrent parse result would be \"Test\"\r\nfixed parse result would be \"\\\"Test\\\"\"\r\n\r\nA property is used to turn on the new functionality, so default operation is not changed for the processors and only applicable when RFC4180 format is used.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10259](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10259) Improves HTTP error handling for authentication failures, providing additional details when the web application rejects a JWT Bearer Token.\r\n\r\nImprovements include introducing `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint`, which delegates to the Spring Security `BearerTokenAuthenticationEntryPoint` for OAuth2 Authentication Exceptions. The `BearerTokenAuthenticationEntryPoint` prepares a standard `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP response header containing error parameters described in [RFC 6749 Section 5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-5.2). The new `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint` uses the response header as the basis for a response body.\r\n\r\nFor all other Authentication Exceptions, the `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint` returns an HTTP 401 status code with a response containing a message stating `Unauthorized`. This builds on the current configuration, which returns an HTTP 401 status code without a response body.\r\n\r\nThe `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint` also checks for the presence of the HTTP Authorization Bearer Cookie, and sets a response header instructing the client to remove the cookie from storage. This implementation follows the strategy in `AccessResource.getAccessStatus()` and provides a more consistent approach.\r\n\r\nConfiguration updates include using the `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint` as the default Authentication Entry Point for both the Spring Security Filter Chain and the Bearer Token Authentication Filter.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10235) Changes the behavior of Provenance Replay handling to resolve issues when running with encrypted repositories enabled.\r\n\r\nWhen running with encrypted repositories, the content stored in the repository is larger than the file size itself, since it contains an encryption metadata header. This difference in size causes Provenance Replays to fail due to setting the replay ContentClaim length based on the previous file size. Changing the approach to set the ContentClaim length based on the ContentClaim size that the Content Repository reports allows replays to function as expected.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

For v5 connections the processor from now on uses HiveMQ Client library while in case of v3.1.x connections it uses the existing Paho library. HiveMQ Client could have been used for v3.1.x connections but it seemed to be safer to use the existing library for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10249](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10249) Enables parallel builds in GitHub continuous integration workflows. The configuration uses `--threads 1C` resulting in one thread per CPU core.\r\n\r\nCurrent Ubuntu Linux runners have two cores, macOS runners have three cores, and Windows runners have one core, resulting in different behavior based on each OS.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include using a direct GitHub Actions Cache step for Static Analysis to have a cache key different from standard setup-java build steps.\r\n\r\nMaven plugin version updates include the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded maven-enforcer-plugin from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0\r\n- Upgraded maven-dependency-plugin from 3.2.0 to 3.3.0\r\n-

When using flow.json.gz (versus flow.xml.gz), this nuance makes a difference in particular when establishing access policies on initial startup. Policies were being incorrectly defined when not using Instance Identifier.\r\n\r\nFor testing, NiFi was configured with the 'managed-authorizer' (nifi.properties) and a specific initial admin user (authorizers.xml). NiFi was started in order to generate an initial, empty flow.xml.gz/flow.json.gz. NiFi was shutdown and the authorizations.xml and users.xml files were removed. NiFi was started again.\r\n\r\nNow, since both the flow and a root process group exist, component access policies for the group are created and the initial admin user is added to the policy. Prior to this fix, the component access policies would be populated incorrectly with the \"Identifier\" UUID. Now, they are populated correctly with the \"Instance Identifier\" UUID.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10228)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following
