What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `SQLQueryTestSuite` to also consume the same input SQL queries from the input files in second pass and then perform analysis and generate the string representation of the analyzed plans, in a separate new directory. It works much the same way as the previous `SQLQueryTestSuite` behavior except that it now also produces analyzed plan string instead of just query results in the output golden files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis framework will help us guard against bugs in future development by showing a clear signal when analyzer updates result in changes to the query plans for a body of test queries. PR authors and reviewers will be able to see the diffs for all changed plans during the review, and any unintentional plan changes will act as a signal for PR authors to adjust their code to prevent the changes from happening.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis test adds a new test suite and initial golden file. The new test suite passes as of this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemoved the logging of shuffle service name multiple times in the driver log.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nOn K8s cluster mode, \r\n\r\n1. when `spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion=false`, print the application information on `spark-submit` exit, as it did before [SPARK-35174](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35174)\r\n\r\n2. add `appId` in the output message\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOn K8s cluster mode, when `spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion=false`,\r\nbefore [SPARK-35174](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35174), the `spark-submit` will exit quickly w/ the basic application information.\r\n```\r\nlogInfo(s\"Deployed Spark application ${conf.appName} with submission ID $sId into Kubernetes\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter [SPARK-35174](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35174), those part of code is unreachable, so nothing is output.\r\n\r\nThis PR also proposes to add `appId` in the output message, to make it consistent w/ the context (if you look at the `LoggingPodStatusWatcherImpl`, this is kind of an exception, `... application $appId ...` is used in other places), and YARN.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8860f69455e5a722626194c4797b4b42cccd4510/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/Client.scala#L1311-L1318\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, changes contain\r\n1) when `spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion=false`, the user can see the app information when `spark-submit` exit.\r\n2) the end of `spark-submit` information contains app id now, which is consistent w/ the context and other resource managers like YARN.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixed the counter-intuitive behaviors of the `ApproximatePercentile` expression mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42775. See the following *user-facing* changes for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When working on decimals, this expression has the same output type as the input type. When the result that doesn't fit into output decimal type, it silently produces the result since the `Decimal` object is capable of representing decimals of arbitrary precision and scale. However, this can lead to weird behaviors because the value doesn't fit into its type. We should throw an exception immediately.\r\n\r\nOld results:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- ApproximatePercentile will first cast decimal value 9999999999999999999 into double, which results in 1E20, and cast 1E20 back into decimal, which doesn't fit the type decimal(19, 0).\r\n-- Here it is producing \"NULL\" because the value doesn't fit into its type, but it is actually not NULL.\r\nspark-sql> select approx_percentile(col, 0.5) from values (9999999999999999999) as tab(col);\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql> select approx_percentile(col, 0.5) is null from values (9999999999999999999) as tab(col);\r\nfalse\r\nspark-sql> select cast(approx_percentile(col, 0.5) as string) from values (9999999999999999999) as tab(col);\r\n10000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew results:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select approx_percentile(col, 0.5) from values (9999999999999999999) as tab(col);\r\nthrows SparkArithmeticException\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass existing tests and some new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for WRITE_FLUSH_BYTES for RocksDB used in streaming stateful operators\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIts useful to get this metric for bytes written during flush from RocksDB as part of the DB custom metrics. We propose to add this to the existing metrics that are collected. There is no additional overhead since we are just querying the internal ticker guage, similar to other metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince jdk1.8 there is an additional function in reflection API `getParameterCount`, it is better to use that function instead of `getParameterTypes.length` because `getParameterTypes` function makes a copy of the parameter types array every invocation:\r\n```java\r\n    public Class<?>[] getParameterTypes() {\r\n        return parameterTypes.clone();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n`getParameterCount` returns amount of parameters directly:\r\n```java\r\n    public int getParameterCount() { return parameterTypes.length; }\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid redundant arrays creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-14T18:08:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T02:46:39Z","closed_at":"2023-03-18T02:46:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1d838630dec3dd75a76746f566282a0728b0a16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/802431d73c7c9b8a2b1cf9cc422cae80749e4743","head":{"label":"NarekDW:reflection-get-parameter-count","ref":"reflection-get-parameter-count","sha":"802431d73c7c9b8a2b1cf9cc422cae80749e4743","user":{"login":"NarekDW","id":24260474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYwNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24260474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW","html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":573114199,"node_id":"R_kgDOIikHVw","name":"spark","full_name":"NarekDW/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NarekDW","id":24260474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYwNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24260474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW","html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NarekDW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NarekDW/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an API for data sources to indicate the advisory partition size for V2 writes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nData sources have an API to request a particular distribution and ordering of data for V2 writes. If AQE is enabled, the default session advisory partition size (64MB) will be used as target. Unfortunately, this default value is still suboptimal and can lead to small files because the written data can be compressed nicely using columnar file formats. Spark should allow data sources to indicate the advisory shuffle partition size, just like it lets data sources request a particular number of partitions. This feature would allow data sources to estimate the compression ratio and incorporate that in the requested advisory partition size.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. However, the changes are backward compatible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the existing tests for V2 write distribution and ordering.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-14T16:48:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-17T22:59:51Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T20:10:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99dfeac5ca57125dc58f84cd902af252bc2a90d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new rule to rewrite multiple `GetJsonObjects` to one `JsonTuple` if their json expressions are the same and the path is `.name`. For example:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.RewriteGetJsonObject ===\r\n!Project [get_json_object(a#0, $.c1) AS c1#3, get_json_object(a#0, $.c2) AS c2#4, get_json_object(b#1, $.c1) AS c3#5, get_json_object(b#1, $.c2) AS c4#6, get_json_object(c#2, $.c1) AS c5#7]   Project [c1#13 AS c1#3, c2#14 AS c2#4, c1#15 AS c3#5, c2#16 AS c4#6, get_json_object(c#2, $.c1) AS c5#7]\r\n!+- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1, c#2]                                                                                                                                                      +- Generate json_tuple(b#1, c1, c2), false, b, [c1#15, c2#16]\r\n!                                                                                                                                                                                                  +- Generate json_tuple(a#0, c1, c2), false, a, [c1#13, c2#14]\r\n!                                                                                                                                                                                                     +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1, c#2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that it needs to rewrite the path, otherwise it will not get the correct value. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT get_json_object('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', '$.name') AS name;\r\nalice\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT name lateral view json_tuple('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', '$.name') a AS name;\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql (default)> select name lateral view json_tuple('{\"name\": \"alice\", \"age\": 5}', 'name') a AS name;\r\nalice\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\n\r\nBenchmark result:\r\n\r\nNo. of   GetJsonObjects | Default(ms) | Rewrite to JsonTuple(ms) | Relative\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n2 | 37914 | 24887 |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37880 when user spark submit without `--deploy-mode XXX` or `–conf spark.submit.deployMode=XXXX`, may face NPE with this code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#164\r\n```scala\r\nargs.deployMode.equals(\"client\") &&\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, submit without `deployMode` is not allowed and will throw an exception and terminate the application, but we should leave it to the later logic to give the appropriate hint instead of giving a NPE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n![popo_2023-03-14

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`CoalesceShufflePartitions` should make sure all leaves are `ExchangeQueryStageExec` to avoid collect `TableCacheQueryStage`. As we can not change the partition number of IMR.\r\n\r\nAdd two tests to make sure `CoalesceShufflePartitions` works well with `TableCacheQueryStage`. Note that, these two tests work without this pr, thanks to `ValidateRequirements` the wrong plan has been reverted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39268 / [SPARK-41752](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41752) added a new non-optional `rootExecutionId: Long` field to the SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart case class.\r\n\r\nWhen JsonProtocol deserializes this event it uses the \"ignore missing properties\" Jackson deserialization option, causing the rootExecutionField to be initialized with a default value of 0.\r\n\r\nThe value 0 is a legitimate execution ID, so in the deserialized event we have no ability to distinguish between the absence of a value and a case where all queries have the first query as the root.\r\n\r\nThanks @JoshRosen for reporting and investigating this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DS V2 pushdown could let JDBC dialect decide to push down `OFFSET`, `LIMIT` and table sample. Because some databases doesn't support one of them, so we should change the default value of these pushdown API false. If one database support the syntax, the JDBC dialect should overwrite the value.\r\n\r\nWe also have a lot of JDBC options about push down, such as `pushDownOffset`. Users could change the option value to allow or disallow push down.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR change all JDBC v2 pushdown options to true and change all the dialect's pushdown

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRun `LocalDateTime.now()` and `Instant.now()` with Java 8 & 11 always get microseconds on both Linux and MacOS, but there are some differences when using Java 17, it will get accurate nanoseconds on Linux, but still get the microseconds on MacOS. \r\n\r\nOn Linux(CentOs)\r\n\r\n```\r\njshell> java.time.LocalDateTime.now()\r\n$1 ==>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCopy the logic of handleTaskCompletion in DAGScheduler for processing the last shuffleMapTask into submitMissingTasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn condition of push-based shuffle being enabled and speculative tasks existing, a shuffleMapStage will be resubmitting once fetchFailed occurring, then its parent stages will be resubmitting firstly and it will cost some time to compute. Before the shuffleMapStage being resubmitted, its all speculative tasks success and register map output, but speculative task successful events can not trigger shuffleMergeFinalized( shuffleBlockPusher.notifyDriverAboutPushCompletion ) because this stage has been removed from runningStages.\r\n\r\nThen this stage is resubmitted, but speculative tasks have registered map output and there are no missing tasks to compute, resubmitting stages will also not trigger shuffleMergeFinalized. Eventually this stage‘s _shuffleMergedFinalized keeps false.\r\n\r\nThen AQE will submit next stages which are dependent on  this shuffleMapStage occurring fetchFailed. And in getMissingParentStages, this stage will be marked as missing and will be resubmitted, but next stages are added to waitingStages after this stage being finished, so next stages will not be submitted even though this stage's resubmitting has been finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis extreme case is very difficult to construct, and we added logs to our production environment to capture the number of problems and verify the stability of the job. I am happy to provide a timeline of the various events in which the problem arose。\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-13T08:25:21Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T05:08:16Z","closed_at":"2023-03-22T02:22:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed83efbfcdfc1406d35ecb33d9496c395302f42b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f195a38f00a79d081788c97fb922c63b2ab04d80","head":{"label":"Stove-hust:feature-40082","ref":"feature-40082","sha":"f195a38f00a79d081788c97fb922c63b2ab04d80","user":{"login":"Stove-hust","id":52523908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52523908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust","html_url":"https://github.com/Stove-hust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":453332861,"node_id":"R_kgDOGwVPfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"Stove-hust/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Stove-hust","id":52523908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIzOTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52523908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust","html_url":"https://github.com/Stove-hust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stove-hust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Stove-hust/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds a precondition before `RemoteSparkSession` starts connect server to check whether `spark-hive-**.jar` exists in the `assembly/target/scala-*/jars` directory, and will fallback to using `spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory` to start the connect server if `spark-hive-**.jar` doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nWhen using `spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory` to start connect server, some test cases that strongly rely on the hive module will be ignored rather than fail rudely.  At the same time, developers can see the following message on the terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] ClientE2ETestSuite:\r\nWill start Spark Connect server with `spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory`, some tests that rely on Hive will be ignored.

Test with sbt: run test with `-Phive` profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid rough failure of connect client module UTs due to lack of hive-related dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manual  checked test with `-Phive` is same as before\r\n- Manual test:\r\n  - Maven\r\n\r\nrun \r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\nRun completed in 14 seconds, 999 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 684\r\nSuites: completed 12, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 678, failed 6, canceled 0, ignored 1, pending 0\r\n*** 6 TESTS FAILED ***\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 761 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to parameterize the max number of attempts for driver props fetcher in `KubernetesExecutorBackend` by introducing a new environment variable, `EXECUTOR_DRIVER_PROPS_FETCHER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, for testing purpose.\r\n\r\nNote that this feature is proposed as a new environment variable because this happens before getting `SparkConf` from the driver.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn case of K8s network issues, the executor pods could fail with `UnknownHostException`. `EXECUTOR_DRIVER_PROPS_FETCHER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` could be helpful in that case.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Failed to connect to pi-....svc/<unresolved>:7078\r\nCaused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: pi-....svc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

The bug causes the ReusedExchange to point to an unknown child since that child subtree was \"pruned\" in a previous AQE iteration. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by finding all the ReusedExchange nodes in the tree that have a `child` node that has NOT been processed in the final plan (meaning it has no ID or it has an incorrect ID generated from the previous AQE iteration). It then traverses the child subtree and generates correct IDs for them. We print this missing subtree in a new section called `Adaptively Optimized Out Exchanges`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is an example to demonstrate the root cause:\r\n\r\n> AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\n>   |-- SomeNode X (subquery xxx)\r\n>       |-- Exchange A\r\n>           |-- SomeNode Y\r\n>               |-- Exchange B\r\n> \r\n> Subquery:Hosting operator = SomeNode Hosting Expression = xxx dynamicpruning#388\r\n> AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\n>   |-- SomeNode M\r\n>       |-- Exchange C\r\n>           |-- SomeNode N\r\n>               |-- Exchange D\r\n> \r\n\r\nStep 1: Exchange B is materialized and the QueryStage is added to stage cache\r\n\r\nStep 2: Exchange D reuses Exchange B\r\n\r\nStep 3: Exchange C is materialized and the QueryStage is added to stage cache\r\n\r\nStep 4: Exchange A reuses Exchange C\r\n\r\nThen the final plan looks like:\r\n\r\n> AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\n>   |-- SomeNode X (subquery xxx)\r\n>       |-- Exchange A -> ReusedExchange (reuses Exchange C)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Subquery:Hosting operator = SomeNode Hosting Expression = xxx dynamicpruning#388\r\n> AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\n>   |-- SomeNode M\r\n>       |-- Exchange C -> PhotonShuffleMapStage ....\r\n>           |-- SomeNode N\r\n>               |-- Exchange D -> ReusedExchange (reuses Exchange B)\r\n> \r\n\r\nAs a result, the ReusedExchange (reuses Exchange B) will refer to a non-exist node.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `spark.createDataFrame` to apply the given schema to work with non-nullable data types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `spark.createDataFrame` won't work with non-nullable schema as below:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> schema_false = StructType([StructField(\"id\", IntegerType(), False)])\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[1]], schema=schema_false)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.AnalysisException: [NULLABLE_COLUMN_OR_FIELD] Column or field `id` is nullable while it's required to be non-nullable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas it works fine with nullable schema:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> schema_false = StructType([StructField(\"id\", IntegerType(), False)])\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[1]], schema=schema_false)\r\nDataFrame[id: int]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`spark.createDataFrame` with non-nullable schema will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded related

toLiteralProto` in client module, it support more types;\r\n\r\nWe'd better factor it out to common module, so that both client and server can leverage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter more thinking, it's a bit fragile to propagate metadata columns through Union. We have added quite some new fields in the file source `_metadata` metadata column such as `row_index`, `block_start`, etc. Some are parquet only. The same thing may happen in other data sources as well. If one day one table under Union adds a new metadata column (or add a new field if the metadata column is a struct type), but other tables under Union do not have this new column, then Union can't propagate metadata columns and the query will suddenly fail to analyze.\r\n\r\nTo be future-proof, let's revert this support.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto make the analysis behavior more robust.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, but propagating metadata columns through Union is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds server-side artifact management as a follow up to the client-side artifact transfer introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256.\r\n\r\nNote: The artifacts added on the server are visible to **all users** of the cluster. This is a limitation of the current spark architecture (unisolated classloaders).\r\n\r\nApart from storing generic artifacts, we handle jars and classfiles in specific ways:\r\n\r\n- Jars: \r\n  - Jars may be added but not removed or overwritten.\r\n  - Added jars would be visible to **all** users/tasks/queries.\r\n- Classfiles:\r\n  - Classfiles may not be explicitly removed but are allowed to be overwritten.\r\n  - We piggyback on top of the REPL architecture to serve classfiles to the executors\r\n    -  If a REPL is initialized, classfiles are stored in the existing `spark.repl.class.outputDir` and share the URI with `spark.repl.class.uri`.\r\n    - If a REPL is not being used, we use a custom directory (root: `sparkContext. sparkConnectArtifactDirectory`) to store classfiles and point the `spark.repl.class.uri` towards it.\r\n  - Class files are visible to **all** users/tasks/queries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256 implements the client-side transfer of artifacts to the server but currently, the server does not process these requests.\r\n\r\nWe need to implement a server-side management mechanism to handle the storage of these artifacts on the driver as well as perform further processing (such as adding jars and moving class files to the right directories).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new experimental API but no behavioural changes.\r\nA new method called `sparkConnectArtifactDirectory` is accessible through SparkContext (the directory storing all artifacts from SparkConnect)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a hook `onParamChange` in `Params.{set, setDefault, clear}`, so that subclass can update the internal status within it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn 3.1, we added internal auxiliary variables in LoR and AFT to optimize prediction/transformation.\r\nIn LoR, when users call `model.{setThreshold, setThresholds}`, the internal status will be correctly updated.\r\n\r\nBut users still can call `model.set(model.threshold, value)`, then the status will not be updated.\r\nAnd when users call `model.clear(model.threshold)`, the status should be updated with default threshold value 0.5.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.linalg._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.classification._\r\n\r\nval df = Seq((1.0, 1.0, Vectors.dense(0.0, 5.0)), (0.0, 2.0, Vectors.dense(1.0, 2.0)), (1.0, 3.0, Vectors.dense(2.0, 1.0)), (0.0, 4.0, Vectors.dense(3.0, 3.0))).toDF(\"label\", \"weight\", \"features\")\r\n\r\nval lor = new LogisticRegression().setWeightCol(\"weight\")\r\nval model = lor.fit(df)\r\n\r\nval vec = Vectors.dense(0.0, 5.0)\r\n\r\nval p0 = model.predict(vec)                                               //  return 0.0\r\nmodel.setThreshold(0.05)                                                 //  change status\r\nval p1 = model.set(model.threshold, 0.5).predict(vec)   //  return 1.0; but should be 0.0\r\nval p2 = model.clear(model.threshold).predict(vec)      //  return 1.0; but should be 0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat makes it even worse it that `pyspark.ml` always set params via `model.set(model.threshold, value)`, so the internal status is easily out of sync, see the example in [SPARK-42747](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42747)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

`BatchScanExec` as its `equals()` and `hashCode()` as those shouldn't throw NPE in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut if we dig deeper we realize that the NPE orrurs since https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37525 and the root cause of the problem is changing `AliasAwareOutputExpression.aliasMap` from immutable to mutable. The mutable map deserialization invokes the `hashCode()` of the keys while that is not the case with immutable maps. In this case the key is a subquery expression whose plan contains the `BatchScanExec`.\r\nPlease note that the mutability of `aliasMap` shouldn't be an issue as it is a `private` field of `AliasAwareOutputExpression` (though adding a simple `.toMap` would also help to avoid the NPE).\r\nBased on the above findings this PR also proposes making `aliasMap` to transient as it isn't needed on executors.\r\n\r\nA side quiestion is if adding any subqery expressions to `AliasAwareOutputExpression.aliasMap` makes any sense because `AliasAwareOutputExpression.projectExpression()` mainly projects `child.outputPartitioning` and `child.outputOrdering` that can't contain subquery expressions. But there are a few exceptions (`SortAggregateExec`, `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec`) where `AliasAwareQueryOutputOrdering.orderingExpressions` doesn't come from the `child` and actually leaving those expressions in the map doesn't do any harm.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix regression introduced with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37525.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the query works again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen start spark on k8s，driver pod  use spark.kubernetes.driver.master to get apiserver address. This config  us  https://kubernetes.default.svc/ as default and do not care about the apiserver port.\r\n\r\nIn our case, apiserver port is not 443 will driver will throw connectException. As k8s doc mentioned （https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/access-api-from-pod/#directly-accessing-the-rest-api）, we can get master url by getting KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS environment variables from pod. So we add a new conf spark.kubernetes.driver.master.from.pod.env to allow driver get master url from env in cluster mode on k8s\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd a new conf spark.kubernetes.driver.master.from.pod.env  to let the driver pod get apiserver automatically from pod env instead of by  spark.kubernetes.driver.master.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. When user set new conf spark.kubernetes.driver.master.from.pod.env as true, the logic of driver get apiserver url will changed. In some case it will help user to get right apiserver url.\r\nBy default, the conf spark.kubernetes.driver.master.from.pod.env  is false, and the driver logic changes nothing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo. the apiserver is mocked in unit test. we tested this feature in our k8s

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `RemoteSparkSession` to add an overrideable `sparkConf` field that can be used by tests to pass additional configurations \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMakes `RemoteSparkSession` more like `SharedSparkSession`. This allows plugins for Spark to reuse `RemoteSparkSession` while also being able to enable their extensions to the Spark Connect planner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing
