PR adds ElementCount MonitoringInfo to Dataflow CounterUpdate mapping in java worker.\r\n\r\nThe metric name utilized in dataflow consists of PCollection name plus \"-ElementCount\" suffix.\r\nFrom FnApi SDK Harness we receive PCollectionId defined as value in ProcessBundleDescriptor PTransform outputs list.\r\n\r\nThese two are mapped via ProcessBundleDescriptor.PTransform.Outputs(key)==(WorkItem.PTransform.Outputs.SystemName - PTransform Name Prefix).\r\n\r\nThis PR follows this pattern for mapping MonitoringInfos to CounterUpdates.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR sets up the scaffolding upon which we can build a portable Spark runner. (It is very close to the structure of the Flink portable runner.)\r\n- I chose to put this on the master branch, rather than the [structured streaming](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/spark-runner_structured-streaming) branch. The implementation details of how a pipeline is translated and run are not the focus of this PR; in fact, they are intended to eventually be switched out.\r\n- For now, the runner merely sets up a Spark context and attempts to translate/run a portable pipeline. It \"fails as intended\" because the map of translation functions is empty, left to be filled in by future PRs.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka, @mxm, @echauchot \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nPost-Commit

fixes a problem with portable Flink metrics that dates back to #7183: the runner's \"step name\" is just the name of an executable stage, not the ptransform that metrics are actually part of (which come over the fn API in MIs' \"ptransform\" label). \r\n\r\nMetrics weren't properly tagged with the ptransform they came from until #7624; it wasn't possible to do the right thing before that.\r\n\r\nVersions of these Flink-specific changes exist in both #7915 and #7934, so I'm seeing about factoring them out here; if this is straightforward and can go in first, I can simplify those others by rebasing them on top of this.\r\n\r\nR: @mxm, @ajamato \r\nCC: @robertwb \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

was deprecated in guava 22.0. Now, it causes classpath issues. In this pull request, we fix code in Beam to use vendored guava. Part of the problem still remains because `bigtable-client-core` depends on non-vendored guava.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a `withReshuffle` method on JdbcIO classes so reshuffling can be disabled.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when an operator immediately after `JdbcIO.Read` reshuffles anyway. In my case I am first reading 20 or so tables and then joining them using a `CoGroupByKey`. Since the CoGroupByKey operation would distribute the data anyway, the work to reshuffle the 20 tables is wasted and results in a much more complex graph than necessary.\r\n\r\nThere are no tests for this, as reshuffling is not easily testable as it should practically have \"no effect\". However, there are no tests for the original reparallelization logic either.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

step towards migrating off of nosetests.\r\n\r\n- Runs integration tests via tox: `tox -e\r\npy27-gcp-pytest,py36-pytest,etc.`\r\n- `@pytest.mark.{pre,post}commit` replaces `@attr('IT')`\r\n  - Also can mark tests as: no_dataflow, no_direct, etc. to exclude\r\n  tests that don't pass on certain runners.\r\n- conftest.py replaces BeamTestPlugin\r\n- Jenkins reports for all tests run (not just the last nosetests\r\n    invocation), using multiple XML outputs.\r\n- Allows specifying test module in tox cmd line. Example:\r\n```sh\r\ntox -e py27-pytest apache_beam.transforms.window_test\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill needs:\r\n- Verification that all the tests that run on nose also run\r\non pytest.\r\n\r\nNice to have:\r\n- Parallelization, but this requires fixing pickling issues with the\r\npytest plugins used for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This PR assumes the extra layer of abstraction allowing runners to define their own execution wrappers was heretofore inflating maintenance cost, so I changed JobInvoker and JobInvocation from interfaces to  classes to handle execution logic up until the pipeline is actually run. This means other portable runners will now share the Flink runner's future-based execution framework.\r\n- Unlike #6714, this change required modifications to the Samza runner.\r\n- Some of the helper methods remaining in FlinkPipelineRunner may also be reusable; if I find them useful to the Spark runner, I will move them to JobInvocation in a future PR.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb, @mxm, @angoenka,

Flink version <= 1.5 the Flink Runner has to buffer any elements which are\r\nemitted during a snapshot because the barrier has already been emitted. This\r\nleads to a lot of code complexity.\r\n\r\nFlink version >= 1.6 provides a hook to execute an action before the snapshot\r\nbarrier is emitted by the operator. We can remove the buffering in favor of\r\nfinishing the current bundle in DoFnOperator's prepareSnapshotPreBarrier. The\r\n1.5/1.6/1.7 build setup allows us to make this change with as little code\r\nduplication as possible.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

running ValidatesRunner test suite for Direct Runner using Java 11 I ran into a ConcurrentModificationException in `RowCoderGenerator.generate` method. \r\n\r\nThe cause of the exception was a race condition in a pipeline in `ParDoSchemaTest.testReadAndWrite`, `ParDoSchemaTest.testReadAndWriteMultiOutput` and `ParDoSchemaTest.testReadAndWriteWithSchemaRegistry`, where `RowCoderGenerator.generate` (and, as a result, `HashMap.computeIfAbsent`) was called with the same arguments from different threads. This resulted in tests failing with the exception.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that `HashMap.computeIfAbsent` now throws this exception if an external change is detected, it seems that the simplest solution is to change the map class to `ConcurrentHashMap`, which safeguards against such problems.\r\n\r\n@reuvenlax, WDYT?  \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is focus on supporting [Bundle Finalization](https://s.apache.org/beam-finalizing-bundles) in the Python SDK harness level. The finalizer API design is under discussing and would be changed in the future. \r\nIn order to implement the finalization logic inside the sdk harness, there are some simplifications in other components:\r\n1. For the finalizer API, it may be changed by upcoming PR.\r\n2. For the Python Fnapi runner, it simply requests a finalization if the ```ProcessBundleResponse``` sets the ```requires_finalization``` to true.\r\n\r\nR: @aaltay @robertwb

Send metrics over the job API\r\n  - new job API RPC depends on `MonitoringInfo` protos from the fn api\r\n    - per discussion with @robertwb, I'm going to move `MonitoringInfo` into `model/pipeline`, to avoid introducing a [job API] → [fn API] dep\r\n    - as such, **this PR shouldn't be merged as-is**; that proto move should happen first, but I wanted to get this out for Jenkins and first review pass\r\n- add Python and Java SDK support for portable metrics over the job API\r\n  - portable python flink wordcount outputs the integer `empty_lines` metric!\r\n  - Flink attempted counter PVR cases are now enabled\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb @ajamato \r\nCC: @mxm since I reworked the Flink metrics a bit in particular\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

the LiftedCombiner cache to 2000 elements and when additional keys are added, randomly evict an old one to the next stage.\r\n\r\nThis optimization is necessary for *very large bundles* which may happen for batch jobs. A random eviction policy was better than simply dumping the whole cache when the cap is hit. This implementation takes advantage of Go's built in Random Map Iteration to choose evictees. We can probably do better, but it's not a implementation I'd like the SDK to maintain, so that is deferred until adding dependencies is simpler.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

sources don't report SourceMetadata after successful splits; the serialization to a cloud Source omits metadata all together. This prevents Cloud Dataflow from understanding what the size of the resulting splits might be. Especially when subsources are concatenated together (per the split protocol), this results in potentially ambiguous scenarios where it's not feasible for Cloud Dataflow to infer the appropriate fraction of the input represented by a subsource. To help with this, this change populates the estimated size per source. To minimize the expense of calling getEstimatedSizeBytes per subsource, this change also modifies AvroSource to be built with single file metadata which allows it to efficiently compute its estimated size. Moreover, BigQuerySourceBase now leverages constructing Avro subsources using single file metadata.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-22T04:35:19Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T00:59:04Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T00:59:04Z","merged_at":"2019-03-14T00:59:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"0fa4e20dfb1cee76a71021f82ce0729debf8f2b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/7922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/7922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/7922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e4ec725a574b8d7f19537bfeb2c9926c1a81d80d","head":{"label":"pedapudi:report-remote-source-fractions","ref":"report-remote-source-fractions","sha":"e4ec725a574b8d7f19537bfeb2c9926c1a81d80d","user":{"login":"pedapudi","id":424940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi","html_url":"https://github.com/pedapudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104134947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMzQ5NDc=","name":"beam","full_name":"pedapudi/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pedapudi","id":424940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi","html_url":"https://github.com/pedapudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedapudi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pedapudi/beam","description":"Mirror

fold `MonitoringInfoMetricName` into `MetricKey` ({URN, labels})\r\n  - `MetricKey.stepName` is expanded to a `MetricLabels` map\r\n  - `MetricContainerStepMap` is now keyed off `MetricLabels` \r\n  - (existing use-cases just get a `PTRANSFORM` entry with the `stepName`)\r\n- `MetricName` is basically a MonitoringInfo URN\r\n  - previously only modeled user metrics ({namespace,name})\r\n  - can now model system-metric URNs as well\r\n- `MetricResult` is like a full `MonitoringInfo` ({key, metric value})\r\n  - it also contains both \"attempted\" and \"committed\", which MonitoringInfo does not, but I'm addressing that elsewhere\r\n\r\nR: @ajamato, @Ardagan, @robertwb \r\n\r\n## java/core → model-fn-execution dependency\r\nI waffled on #7867 due to making java/core depend on the `model-fn-execution` proto module. However, talking with @ajamato, it seems like we're ok with that. \r\n\r\nIt *may* be possible to pull more java/core metrics classes (Metric{Key,Name,Labels,Container*}, {Counter,Distribution,Gauge}Cell, and maybe more) into runners-core/java, which already depends on the model-fn-execution protos module, and save adding the dep to java/core. Let me know if I should look into that.\r\n\r\nIf not, someone should sign off on in particular on needing to add `org.apache.beam.model` and vendored gRPC to [this GCP module API surface test](https://github.com/apache/beam/compare/master...ryan-williams:mi-mk?expand=1#diff-e1f378c05ed380fffbfb99e0f819afabR59).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
