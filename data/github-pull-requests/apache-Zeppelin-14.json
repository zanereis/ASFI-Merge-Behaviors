What is this PR for?\r\nBefore this PR zepp was unable to search for keywords in existing notebooks that have not been updated in any way after a restart.\r\n\r\nThis PR pre-indexes all of the notebooks at startup time on a separate thread so that zepp is able to find keywords in existing notebooks whenever user uses the search bar.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4504\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Create a notebook using Spark interpreter\r\n- add small piece of code such as \"println(\"hello\")\r\n- Restart zeppelin\r\n- Search for a keyword \"println\"\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nIn ZEPPELIN-4480, we introduce zeppelin-jupyter-adapter which build a bridge between zeppelin and jupyter, zeppelin can extends this class to leverage any kernel of jupyter.\r\nAfter a second thought, I think it is not enough. We can allow user to use jupyter kernel directly instead of implement one by one. So the purpose is to allow user use jupyter kernel like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n%jupyter(kernel=ipython)\r\n\r\npython_code\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course user can enhance the jupyter kernel in Zeppelin, e.g. IPythonInterpreter of Zeppelin can enhance the ipython kernel by adding support of ZeppelinContext\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4497#\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis is a proposal for removing/disabling `zeppelin.anonymous.allowed` when Shiro is configured.\r\nMy Proposal in this JIRA is; let us remove this

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWe have implemented the frontend API of Angular.js using the latest Angular. But the templates some [differences](https://angular.io/guide/ajs-quick-reference) between Angular.js and Angular.\r\n\r\nSo to help users migrate templates, we provide a migration tool that will be integrated into the Zeppelin web. This is its [DEMO](https://ng1-updater.hsuan.xyz/) it can quickly fix these differences.\r\n\r\nWe plan to do the following work:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new type `%ng` (official abbreviation) to distinguish between Angular.js and Angular templates.\r\n2. When the user runs a paragraph with the `%angular` type, the upgrade dialog will be open.\r\n3. Upgrade the template in the dialog and click the `Update and Copy` button.\r\n4. Automatically create a paragraph of type `%ng` template in below\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4321\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4450\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* First time? Setup Travis CI as described on https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#continuous-integration\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![ng1-template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/69597301-78de3000-1040-11ea-85a6-830d573f1305.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWhen executing DDL statements (`CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP`) it's possible to get schema disagreement in Cassandra, especially for big/geo-distributed clusters. Java driver has a special handling of such statements, with increased timeout, but it's still possible that next DDL statement will be executed before all nodes agree on the schema version, and this could lead to schema disagreement that need to be resolved by administrators.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira

If the spark interpreter is restarted at this time, the restart interface will be stuck[**thread blocking  in the LazyOpenInterpreter.open method, this is a synchronized method**]. Restarting the spark interpreter fails. only use the yarn applicaiton -kill appID command or the kill -9 SparkSubmit process to restart the spark interpreter., which is very unfriendly to the user.\r\n   At present, I use the system.exit(1) rough way to exit the JVM to achieve the purpose of restarting successfully, similar to the task of ending the ACCEPTED state by using Ctrl+C in the spark-shell.Spark only has **cancelJob** / **cancelStage** APIs,i thinks Spark is unable to do \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are using Angular Latest to refactor Zeppelin's front-end. When implementing the features of the shortcuts, we found that the current shortcuts is somewhat complicated and did not distinguish the Command/Ctrl key between Mac and Windows.\r\n\r\nSo we compared the following applications:\r\n\r\n- [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter)\r\n- [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)\r\n- [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)\r\n\r\nThey can distinguish between edit-mode and command-mode, which will simplify the shortcuts complexity. Meanwhile, we use the [Monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) in the refactor version, it is the core library of [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). We think it is a good choice to use its shortcuts design.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the above reasons, we proposed to redesign Zeppelin's shortcuts according to the table following.\r\n\r\n| Actions                                               | Mode    | Mac              | Windows / Linux       | Old(Mac)         |\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\r\n| Command mode                                          | Edit    | ESC              | ESC                   | -

E.g. if user delete one property defined in `interpreter-setting.json` and then restart zeppelin, he would see this property again as we merged it from `interpreter-setting.json`.
