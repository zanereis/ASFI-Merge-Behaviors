SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere is sharedControls.entity included in the config of the handlebarsTemplateControlSetItem and styleControlSetItem. The \"valueKey\" property from this sharedConfig is used in the exploreReducer in UPDATE_FORM_DATA_BY_DATASOURCE action to reset the control values that are related to a column. If I understand it correctly, the handlebars templates are not column related drag and drop controls. There might be other reasons (based on the comment in dndControls.tsx:45) to have the sharedControls.entity config included, so I just unset the \"valueKey\" property to exclude the handlebars templates control values from the reset on datasource update.\r\n\r\n\"It also seems that the textarea \"blinks\" going back and forth between states.\"\r\nAfter the fix I do not experience the \"blinks\" anymore. Let me know if it is still an issue.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

is dead, now what?](https://dev.to/wojtekmaj/enzyme-is-dead-now-what-ekl)\r\n\r\nWe're deep in RTL already, and the enzyme tests are doing more harm than good to us as maintainers.\r\n\r\nThis has implication on lowering test coverage, but at the same time many of the enzyme tests are against fairly settled, untouched components. I suggest that we delete all the Enzyme tests and agree that touching now-untested component requires writing RTL test to cover the components you touch.\r\n\r\nOverall a good step forward that allows us to drop a large chunk of complexity and branches in our dep tree.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nNOTE: overall there are more enzyme tests than I thought orignally as grepping for `enzyme` missed out on some reusable shims/constructs that indirectly used enzyme. Putting out as DRAFT so we can see what we want to do with this.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-07T23:20:13Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T10:14:52Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"817f74463201a475a9e58590dc12a1fa5c617d79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6496358600,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABgzaQyA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/dependencies:npm","name":"dependencies:npm","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6502628977,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABg5Y-cQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/packages","name":"packages","color":"E795E1","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/32191/commits","

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nHow to reproduce the bug\r\n\r\n1. Create a metric in the dataset.\r\n2. Create a second metric that uses {{ metric('$metric_key') }} to load SQL from the first one.\r\n3. Create a third metric using {{ metric('$metric_key') }} to load SQL from the second one.\r\n\r\nExpected results\r\nThe third metric should be able to successfully retrieve the SQL syntax from the first metric (through the second one).\r\n\r\nActual results\r\nThe third metric retrieves the actual Jinja macro.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

correct URL format for SQL Lab permalinks\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue from this [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31962) by ensuring that permalinks use the correct /sqllab/p/{key} format instead of ?key={key} while still using url_for. Previously , url_for(\"SqllabView.root\", key=key, _external=True) generated URLs in the query parameter format (?key={key}), which caused issues when sharing permalinks across users.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Log in and save a query in SQL Lab.\r\n2. Copy the query URL using the \"Copy Query URL\" option.\r\n3. Share the URL with a different user (one with the `sqllab` role and access to the dataset).\r\n4. Have the other user try to load the shared query URL.\r\n5. Observe that the second user with sqllab_role can successfully load the shared query.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

[!NOTE]\r\n> Endpoint for filter_state accepts the body in the form of { \"value\": \"stringified json\" }. I documented the endpoint with actual json object and specified that it should be stringified and put into value field of the body in the examples. Other approach would be to just put the stringified example there which makes it unreadable but is more reflective.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCopied the \"OAuth2 needed\" logic to `get_sqla_engine`, since for some databases the error happens when calling `create_engine()` (eg, BigQuery) instead of when calling `get_raw_connection`. This way we always catch the error and raise the proper exception.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR extends the import functionality to handle encrypted_extras (shown as \"Secure Extra\" in the UI) for databases. The main change is that I added the `encrypted_extras` parameter to:\r\n    - `/api/v1/database/import/`\r\n    - `/api/v1/assets/import/`\r\n\r\nThis change allows users to provide encrypted_extras when importing databases, improving the flexibility and security of the import process.\r\n\r\nThe encrypted extras work similiarly to passwords, you need to provide them in an extra `form` in the API request.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. deploy superset\r\n2. import a database with an encryped extra via the API\r\n\r\n###

href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases\"><code>@​reduxjs/toolkit</code>'s releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.5.1</h2>\n<p>This <strong>bugfix release</strong> fixes a logic issue with the new <code>upsertQueryEntries</code> util that sometimes kept entries in a <code>pending</code> state indefinitely.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3><code>upsertQueryEntries</code> fixes</h3>\n<p>Users reported that in some cases, use of <code>upsertQueryEntries</code> to insert RTKQ cache entries prevented any further refetches of that data from happening.  After investigation, we found a logic mismatch for how we handle upserts vs the existing <code>upsertQueryData</code> util, which meant that sometimes the entry would be left in a <code>pending</code> state expecting a <code>fulfilled</code> action from a request ID that would never happen.</p>\n<p>This release fixes that issue and ensures the updates and refetches happen correctly.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure upserted cache entries always get written by <a href=\"https://github.com/markerikson\"><code>@​markerikson</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4768\">reduxjs/redux-toolkit#4768</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1\">https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1</a></p>\n<h2>v2.5.0</h2>\n<p>This <strong>feature release</strong> updates the React peer dependency to work with React 19, and fixes an additional skip token issue.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>React 19 Compat</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19\">React 19 was just released</a>!

[esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) from 0.20.2 to 0.24.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases\">esbuild's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.24.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix regression with <code>--define</code> and <code>import.meta</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4010\">#4010</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4012\">#4012</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4013\">#4013</a>)</p>\n<p>The previous change in version 0.24.1 to use a more expression-like parser for <code>define</code> values to allow quoted property names introduced a regression that removed the ability to use <code>--define:import.meta=...</code>.

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher. For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[react-test-renderer](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/HEAD/packages/react-test-renderer) from 17.0.2 to 19.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/releases\">react-test-renderer's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>19.0.0 (December 5, 2024)</h2>\n<p>Below is a list of all new features, APIs, deprecations, and breaking changes. Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings.

Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<h4>React</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Client</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Server</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React Server Components</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deprecations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/\"><code>@​testing-library/react</code></a> or <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro\"><code>@​testing-library/react-native</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React.

href=\"https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/releases\">ol's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v10.4.0</h2>\n<p>With more than 40 pull requests, the 10.4 release brings performance improvements, bug fixes, better TypeScript generics and new features. New features include a convenience <code>Image</code> layer loader for debugging MapServer map files using the MapServer CGI API, and an experimental <code>WebGLVectorTile</code> layer.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade notes</h2>\n<h3>Deprecation of ol/layer/WebGLPoints</h3>\n<p>Use <code>ol/layer/WebGLVector</code> instead. Besides rendering points it will also render lines and polygons.\nIn most cases this is a drop-in replacement.

breaking changes. Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<h4>React</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Client</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Server</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React Server Components</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deprecations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/\"><code>@​testing-library/react</code></a> or <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro\"><code>@​testing-library/react-native</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs. We recommend first upgrading to <code>18.3.1</code>, where we've added additional deprecation warnings. Check out the <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">upgrade guide</a> for more details and guidance on codemodding.</p>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New JSX Transform is now required: We introduced <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html\">a new JSX transform</a> in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.</li>\n<li>Errors in render are not re-thrown: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are now reported to window.reportError. Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nIn the case of the treeview for #31591, I discovered that if the number of tables is enormous, it causes performance issues. Therefore, this commit extracted only the modified table preview UI portion by replacing it to output the metadata of the initially selected table. (preview will be the subset of nested tabs under table preview tab)\r\n\r\nIn this change, the preview query is no longer executed automatically. Instead, it is set to execute the preview when the tab is clicked for verification. Additionally, it has been expanded to allow additional table-related information tabs through extensions, beyond just table columns and index information.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe GSheets database modal has some inconsistencies after OAuth2 was introduced. The current modal asks if the user wants to access \"public sheets\" or \"public and private sheets\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"491\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 11 02 16 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db39a92a-efa6-4f8c-a3a6-121ee157a13b\" />\r\n\r\nIf the user selects the latter a new input appears, so the user can provide service account credentials, either by uploading a JSON file or pasting the credentials:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"492\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 11 04 05 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80962255-6aba-48a0-a91e-535f83372970\" />\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of OAuth2 (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27631) there's now a new way of accessing private sheets.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the \"public\"/\"public and private\" dropdown.\r\n2. Informs the user that in order to access private sheets they need to either provide service account credentials or OAuth2 client information.\r\n3. Adds an explicit input for OAuth2 client information (instead of requiring the user to add it to \"encrypted extra\").\r\n4. Removes the need for adding at least one \"table\" (a sheet URL with an associated name).\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks with this PR:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"487\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-30 at 11 22 05 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efc9d138-4d32-4537-a562-cc5ca6c9e06f\" />\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe migrations to add catalog permissions can take considerably long, as it would get all catalogs exposed to the credentials, then get all schemas for each of these catalogs and create these permissions accordingly. \r\n\r\nThis requires longer migrations that typically run with downtime. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a flag to the `config` that allows to skip these permissions, as these can be created later once the app is up by just editing the DB connection.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nUnit tests added.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSmall adjustment to add an ellipsis and width to the legend based on the margin so that the legend does not overlap the chart when on the sides. Currently you have to manually adjust the margin to make sure that it all fits. There are still some cases in very small margins where there is still some overlap, and manual adjustment to the margins is necessary.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1187\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 3 04 01 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5f3c9f-4b91-4404-b810-25ff4e95bdcb\" />\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02e592c4-1fcd-4e33-a463-8420a32351e4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

addressing false negative npm \"critical\" issue realted to the `eslint-plugin-translation-vars` in relation to a package that got malicious at some point. It appears that @stephenLYZ fixed it by importing the source from the pre-vulnerability package into our repo under `tools/eslint-plugin-translation-vars`. Now I believe it's been reporting a false negative since then.\n\nAnyhow, renaming the `tools/` folder that contains 2 custom lint rules to `eslint-rules`, rename things, point them all to the right

digging into fixing ephemeral envs, I realized that running docker-compose as `superset` didn't work out of the box. `docker-compose.yml` sets `root` as the user which goes around the issue while running `compose`. When switching to user `superset`, there were some permission issues around excecuting certain scripts and such.\r\n\r\nClearly it's better/more-secure to run the app as a non-root user. So here I'm making some changes and simplifying things, paying attention to a few layers, and avoiding doing any sorts of installation of anything while starting the app as the `superset` user in the tree of entrypoint scripts.\r\n\r\nAdding notes in PR/code to explain the changes step-by-step\r\n\r\nTested locally:\r\n-  `docker-compose up` while using the default `root` user\r\n-  `docker-compose up` while using `superset` user\r\n-  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up`\r\n-  `docker-compose build --build-arg
