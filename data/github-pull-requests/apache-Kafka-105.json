is a cherry-pick PR from #8405 to trunk (due to the large divergence we cannot do that vie git cherry-pick).\r\n\r\n* Fix the direct cause of the observed issue on the client side: when heartbeat getting errors and resetting generation, we only need to set it to UNJOINED when it was not already in REBALANCING; otherwise, the join-group handler would throw the retriable UnjoinedGroupException to force the consumer to re-send join group unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n* Fix the root cause of the issue on the broker side: we should still trigger rebalance when static member joins in CompletingRebalance phase; otherwise the member.ids would be changed when the assignment is received from the leader, hence causing the new member.id's assignment to be empty.\r\n\r\n* Added log4j entries as a by-product of my investigation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

have been investigating `ConsumerBounceTest#testRollingBrokerRestartsWithSmallerMaxGroupSizeConfigDisruptsBigGroup` during the last week. I have identified two cases that makes it fail from times to times, especially under high resource constraints. This PR explains and propose a fix for the first case.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, two consumers are kicked out of the group because of the preferred leader election:\r\n- When the group is loaded by Group Coordinator 0 which has the limit in place, it triggers a rebalance to kick out a consumer from the group.\r\n- A first member is kicked out while it re-joins the group.\r\n- Before the rebalance completes, the controller moves the leader from 0 to 1. Therefore, the group is loaded by Group Coordinator 1 and unloaded by Group Coordinator 0. The loaded group has still all members because the rebalance did not complete, therefore it triggers another rebalance to kick out a member from the group.  \r\n- A second member is kicked out while it re-joins the group.\r\n\r\nThe `ConsumerAssignmentPoller` stop themselves when an exception is raised and they report the exception. Therefore the test fails because two consumers have been kicked out from the group where it expects only one to be kicked out.\r\n\r\n```\r\nassertEquals(1, raisedExceptions.size)\r\nassertTrue(raisedExceptions.head.isInstanceOf[GroupMaxSizeReachedException])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, I propose to disable the `AutoLeaderRebalanceEnableProp` for all the tests in `ConsumerBounceTest`. It makes things unpredictable and therefore increase the ricks of flakiness.\r\n\r\n**I haven't been able to get this failure again with this fix. I have run the single test for 24+ hours in a while loop within a docker contain with limited resources to verify.**\r\n\r\nBellow, you can find the relevant traces captured when the test failed.\r\n```\r\n// Group is loaded in GroupCoordinator 0\r\n// A rebalance is triggered because the group is over capacity\r\n[2020-04-02 11:14:33,393] INFO [GroupMetadataManager brokerId=0] Scheduling loading of offsets and group metadata from __consumer_offsets-0 (kafka.coordinator.group.GroupMetadataManager:66)\r\n[2020-04-02 11:14:33,406] INFO [Consumer clientId=ConsumerTestConsumer, groupId=group-max-size-test] Discovered group coordinator localhost:40071 (id: 2147483647 rack: null) (org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator:794)\r\n[2020-04-02 11:14:33,409] INFO Static member MemberMetadata(memberId=ConsumerTestConsumer-ceaab707-69af-4a65-8275-cb7db7fb66b3, groupInstanceId=Some(null), clientId=ConsumerTestConsumer, clientHost=/127.0.0.1, sessionTimeoutMs=10000, rebalanceTimeoutMs=60000, supportedProtocols=List(range), ).groupInstanceId of group group-max-size-test loaded with member id ConsumerTestConsumer-ceaab707-69af-4a65-8275-cb7db7fb66b3 at generation 1.

We should only count this as a standby if the destination client already had this task as a standby; otherwise, the standby already exists on some other client, so we should aim to give it

to: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9761\r\n\r\nChanges the `timeout` flag in the `kafka-consumer-groups` tool to not default to 5000ms. It now uses the Admin Client default(30s currently) by not setting `options.timeoutMs` unless the timeout flag is specified, in which case it ends up using `(min(30s, timeout flag))` in the `AdminClientRunnable` method `sendEligibleCalls`.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are provided that work with the default value and the old default 5000ms. There were already tests for an unreasonably short timeout.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

KAFKA-9806 bug: the __consumer_offsets topic gets created when a consumer try to consume on a new cluster for the first time. If there aren't sufficient cluster-level ACLs, FindCoordinator request succeed, anche __consumer_offsets gets created in zk, but subsequent UpdateMetadata and LeaderAndIsr requests fail, putting the offsets topic in a bad state. When this happens, it is not possible to consume even after updating ACLs (5a).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to introduce a new check before creating the __consumer_offsets topic, so that it does not get created if there aren't sufficient ACLs.\r\n\r\nThis change was tested by following the steps reported in KAFKA-9806, and verifying that it is possible to consume after the code change (5b). Eg:\r\n1. Create a topic\r\n2. Set insufficient cluster level ACLs. Which precise ACL does not matter as long as ClusterAction initiated by administrative messages between brokers is denied. \r\n3. Consume on the topic -> this request will fail with unauthorized errors on the client side as well\r\n4. Remove ACLs or set ACLs to allow inter-broker communication\r\n5a. (Before code change) Produce/consume on topic. Consumer won't be able to read any data.\r\n5b. (After code change) Produce/consume on topic. Consumer are able to read data.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

is a race on receiving a LeaderAndIsr request for a replica with an active log dir reassignment. If the reassignment completes just before the LeaderAndIsr handler updates epoch information, it can lead to an illegal state error since no future log dir exists. This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that the future log dir exists when the fetcher is started.

KIP is fairly straightforward, and does as the title describes by enforcing a rebalance once the configured `probing.rebalance.interval` has elapsed. However, we have had to modify the original plan in the KIP slightly to handle an edge case with static membership enabled:\r\n\r\nSince the group leader can crash and restart without triggering a rebalance, we can't rely on a purely in-memory flag/counter to keep track of these probing rebalances. We can instead rely on the assignment, encoding the upcoming probing rebalance in the `AssignmentInfo`. This is encoded as the time in ms of the next scheduled rebalance, ie it is set to `currentTimeMs + probingRebalanceIntervalMs` when the assignment is being generated. This anchors the probing rebalances to wall clock time, and ensures a pathologically failing member will not prevent the group from ever rebalancing. We leave it up to a single member to be responsible for triggering the probing rebalances, and encode this for a single consumer on the leader's client (chosen arbitrarily). \r\n\r\nThis PR also adds tracking of whether a followup rebalance is required to `StreamsPartitionAssignor#assign` in order to log when the group is actually stable. This applies not only to KIP-441, but to version probing and cooperative rebalances as

set of cleanup pushed to followup PR after KIP-441 Pt. 5. Main changes are:\r\n\r\n1) Moved `RankedClient` and the static `buildClientRankingsByTask` to a new file\r\n2) Moved `Movement` and the static `getMovements` to a new file (also renamed to `TaskMovement`)\r\n3) Consolidated the many common variables throughout the assignment tests to the new `AssignmentTestUtils` \r\n4) New utility to generate comparable/predictable UUIDs for tests, and removed the generic from `TaskAssignor` and all related classes\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, this does not represent the sum whole of all cleanup we'd like to do.

Fix the direct cause of the observed issue on the client side: when heartbeat getting errors and resetting generation, we only need to set it to UNJOINED when it was not already in REBALANCING; otherwise, the join-group handler would throw the retriable UnjoinedGroupException to force the consumer to re-send join group unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n2. Fix the root cause of the issue on the broker side: we should still trigger rebalance when static member joins in CompletingRebalance phase; otherwise the member.ids would be changed when the assignment is received from the leader, hence causing the new member.id's assignment to be empty.\r\n\r\n3.

NOT MERGE UNTIL KIP-582 IS APPROVED**\r\n\r\n### Pull Request for KIP-582\r\n\r\nSome background: currently there are two error handling options in Kafka Connect, \"none\" and \"all\". Option \"none\" will config the connector to fail fast, and option \"all\" will ignore broken records.\r\n\r\nIf users want to store their broken records, they have to config a broken record queue, which is too much work for them in some cases. \r\n\r\nSome sink connectors have the ability to deal with broken records, for example, a JDBC sink connector can store the broken raw bytes into a separate table, a S3 connector can store that in a zipped file.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would be ideal if Kafka Connect provides an additional option that sends the broken raw bytes to SinkTask directly. \r\n\r\nWiki: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=148642653 \r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9740\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

some context, when building a streams application, the optimizer keeps track of the key-changing operations and any repartition nodes that are descendants of the key-changer.  During the optimization phase (if enabled), any repartition nodes are logically collapsed into one.  The optimizer updates the graph by inserting the single repartition node between the key-changing node and its first child node.  This graph update process is done by searching for a node that has the key-changing node as one of its direct parents, and the search starts from the repartition node, going up in the parent hierarchy. \r\n\r\nThe one exception to this rule is if there is a merge node that is a descendant of the key-changing node, then during the optimization phase, the map tracking key-changers to repartition nodes is updated to have the merge node as the key.  Then the optimization process updates the graph to place the single repartition node between the merge node and its first child node. \r\n\r\nThe error in KAFKA-9739 occurred because there was an assumption that the repartition nodes are children of the merge node.  But in the topology from KAFKA-9739, the repartition node was a parent of the merge node.  So when attempting to find the first child of the merge node, nothing was found (obviously) resulting in `StreamException(Found a null keyChangingChild node for..)`\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by first checking that all repartition nodes for optimization are children of the merge node.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a test with the topology from KAFKA-9739.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

patch addresses a locking issue with DelayTxnMarker completion. Because of the reliance on the shared read lock in TransactionStateManager and the deadlock avoidance algorithm in `DelayedOperation`, we cannot guarantee that a call to checkAndComplete will offer an opportunity to complete the job. This patch removes the reliance on this lock in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. We replace the transaction marker purgatory with a map of transaction with pending markers. We were not using purgatory expiration anyway, so this avoids the locking issue and simplifies usage.\r\n2. We were also relying on the read lock for the `DelayedProduce` completion when calling `ReplicaManager.appendRecords`. As far as I can tell, this was not necessary. The lock order is always 1) state read/write lock, 2) txn metadata locks. Since we only call `appendRecords` while holding the read lock, a deadlock does not seem possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

reasons outlined in the ticket, we can't upgrade to a version of Jetty with the bug fixed, or downgrade to one prior to the introduction of the bug. Luckily, the actual fix is pretty straightforward and can be ported over to Connect for use until it's possible to upgrade to a version of Jetty with that bug fixed:

source compatibility offered by ```scala-collection-compat``` is based on scala implicit conversions. It means the \"explicit\" reference in java code ```HighwatermarkCheckpointBench``` can't join the party (```scala.jdk.CollectionConverters``` is linked to scala 2.13 code and the symbol used by ```HighwatermarkCheckpointBench``` is gone)\r\n\r\nIt seems to me we should have a collection of helper methods to offer the conversion like ```scala-collection-compat``` and it servers for jmh java code only.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces ```scala.jdk.CollectionConverters``` by ```scala.collection.JavaConverters``` since ```scala.collection.JavaConverters``` methods required by ```HighwatermarkCheckpointBench``` exists on both scala 2.12 and scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

`rest.advertised.listener` config is currently broken as setting it to `http` when listeners are configured for both `https` and `http` will cause the framework to choose whichever of the two listeners is listed first. The changes here attempt to fix this by checking not only that `ServerConnector::getName` begins with the specified protocol, but also that that protocol is immediately followed by an underscore, which the framework uses as a delimiter between the protocol and the remainder of the connector name.\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test for the `RestServer::advertisedUrl` method has been expanded to include a case that fails with the framework in its current state and passes with the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ee0ef09db4e450f3d32cc70b21eeca927820fefe/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/rest/RestServer.java#L181 and

name for the `ServerConnector` instances it creates.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

[More about the endpoint here.](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_rest)\r\n\r\nWith this addition, the validations for the connector can be tested in a similar way integration tests currently use the `configureConnector` method, for ex: `connect.configureConnector(CONNECTOR_NAME, props);`.

versions of the JoinGroup rely on a new member timeout to keep the group from growing indefinitely in the case of client disconnects and retrying. The logic for resetting the heartbeat expiration task following completion of the rebalance failed to account for an implicit expectation that shouldKeepAlive would return false the first time it is invoked when a heartbeat expiration is scheduled. This patch fixes the issue by making heartbeat satisfaction logic explicit.\r\n\r\nReviewers:  Chia-Ping Tsai <chia7712@gmail.com>, Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>, Rajini Sivaram

KafkaStreamsTest takes 2min20s on my local laptop, because lots of its integration test which is producing / consuming records, and checking state directory file system takes lots of time.

fix for [KAFKA-8523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8523) attempted to skip (immediately returns) tombstone records when InsertField$Value is used. However, it also inadvertently also skips tombstone records when InsertField$Key is used, despite the possibility that the tombstone record’s key is non null.\r\n\r\nThis commit corrects the behavior so that the InsertField$Value continues to skip tombstone records, but InsertField$Key only skips when the record’s *key* is null.\r\n\r\nAdded two unit tests, and verified that these tests fail without the proposed fix and pass with the proposed fix. The other unit tests were added with [KAFKA-8523](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8523) continue to pass.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported all the way back to the 1.0 branch, since that's

enabled lazy mmap on index files by initializing indices\r\non-demand rather than performing costly disk/memory operations when\r\ncreating all indices on broker startup. This helped reducing the startup\r\ntime of brokers. However, segment indices are still created on closing\r\nsegments, regardless of whether they need to be closed or not.\r\n\r\nThis is a cleaned up version of #7900, which was submitted by @efeg. It\r\neliminates unnecessary disk accesses and memory map operations while\r\ndeleting, renaming or closing offset and time indexes.\r\n\r\nIn a cluster with 31 brokers, where each broker has 13K to 20K segments,\r\n@efeg and team observed up to 2 orders of magnitude faster LogManager\r\nshutdown times - i.e. dropping the LogManager shutdown time of each\r\nbroker from 10s of seconds to 100s of milliseconds.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion between `renameTo` and `setFile`, I replaced the\r\nlatter with the more restricted updateParentDir` (it turns out that's\r\nall we need).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Adem Efe Gencer <agencer@linkedin.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify
