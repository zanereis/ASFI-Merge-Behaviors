Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x]  Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd TimeBasedORCSerDeWriterPartitioner supports timestamps or\r\ndate time strings.\r\nThe OrcSerdeRow that contains the timestamp can be set using\r\nwriter.partition.column only accept simple value,\r\ne.g., \"timestamp\" or \"event_date\".\r\nwriter.partition.column.index that contains the index of column,\r\nhas better performance.\r\nwriter.partition.column.pattern that contains format of column\r\nwhen you have a date_time as string that use DateTimeFormatter on UTC,\r\ne.g., \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS\"\r\nGeneralization of Time Based ORCSerDe partitioner. Example of use:\r\nwriter.partitioner.class=org.apache.gobblin.writer.partitioner.TimeBasedORCSerDeWriterPartitioner\r\nwriter.partition.granularity=day\r\nwriter.partition.pattern='event_date='YYYY-MM-dd\r\nwriter.partition.timezone=UTC\r\nwriter.partition.column=date_time\r\nwriter.partition.column.pattern=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS\r\nwriter.partition.column.timezone=UTC\r\nwriter.partition.column.index=6\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nFix TimeBasedORCSerDeWriterPartitioner format like goblin said. \r\nAdd suport ot date time strings on TimeBasedAvroWriterPartitioner. \r\nwriter.partition.columns.pattern that contains format of column when you have a date_time as string that use DateTimeFormatter, e.g., \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS\" \r\nwriter.partition.columns.timezone that contains time zone to use on DateTimeFormatter default UTC, e.g., \"GMT-3\" \r\nExample of new props: \r\nwriter.partition.columns.pattern=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss \r\nwriter.partition.columns.timezone=UTC\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests OR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest in release candidate.\r\nTimeBasedAvroWriterPartitionerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

This PR implements this by retrieving and storing these block locations as a property in the work unit in DistcpFileSplitter.splitFiles, and then retrieving the list by deserializing the work unit file when creating the GobblinWorkUnitsInputFormat.GobblinSplit.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe actual code functionality should remain the same, the only difference that would be seen is MR jobs should be able to be run with some data locality. Modified some of the GobblinSplit unit tests since the deserialization of the work unit file needed to be mocked when getSplits is tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-618\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   Earlier any components that implements StandardMetricsBridge interface has to implements the Instrumentable interface as well. However this should not be required because the external system only relies on the getStandardMetricsCollection() API, instead of others. Hence remove those unused interfaces from StandardMetricsBridge class.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-616\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe add the ability to fork jobs when concatenating 2 dags, as part of constructing a multi-hop path. An example use case is to allow retention jobs on each hop of the path to run in parallel to the distcp jobs along a multi-hop path, thus preventing the data copy on a subsequent hop from being blocked on a retention job on a previous hop. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded test cases to DagTest and FlowGraphPathTest classes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

them via Gobblin\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-613](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-613) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe use the Hadoop tokens provided by the WormholePushJob, instead of relying on Gobblin to negotiate them. Each WormohlePushJob is going to be run with the appropriate headless account and Gobblin does not have access to these keytabs from inside the Azkaban process. So, we need to include WormohlePushJob job type in the job types with automatic token.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-611\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, if there are multiple changes to GitFlowGraph in a commit, the FlowGraph may end up in an inconsistent state. E.g. consider a commit where node1, node2 and edge from node1 to node2 are added. If the changes are processed in the following order:  add node1, (ii) add edge from node1->node2, and (iii) add node2, then the edge addition is skipped since node2 does not yet exist in the graph. This task ensures that all node related changes are processed and applied to the FlowGraph before edge related changes are applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded a test case to GitFlowGraphMonitorTest class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-609\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nPreviously, when getting config store by topic, the relative path is just added to the end of the config store URI. This is incorrect for URIs with a query portion, it should be added to the path portion of the URI.\r\n\r\nAlso modified `IvyConfigStoreFactory` to take HDFS location as part of the query since the path portion is being used for the relative path.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-606\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe edge case where the flow compilation produces a single hop path results in the same FlowEdge being added twice to the path. The termination condition check for path construction needs to be re-ordered to prevent the duplicate addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded a test case to MultiHopFlowCompilerTest class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-605\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe flow execution id is currently set twice - once during instantiation of PathFinder and also during findPath() call. This prevents correct tracking of Flow and job statuses.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-604\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe dependencies list in job templates (specified in job.dependencies config) are based on file names of job templates. But since the same job template could be re-used across multiple jobs in a multi-hop flow, the dependencies need to be made unique to avoid collisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nEnhanced test cases in MultiHopFlowCompilerTest class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-599\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTask creation errors in GobblinMultiTaskAttempt.runWorkUnits() may result in GobblinMultiTaskAttempt.run() exiting prematurely and with an incorrect CountDownLatch count. This has been observed to result in hangs and tasks running to completion, but not committing.\r\nThe fix is to catch exceptions in the task creation and submission block and logging the exception without re-throwing it. The count down latch is not incremented until after it is added to the task list. Tasks that did not run will not be committed and the run loop will not wait for their completion.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTaskErrorIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-598\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - Modified the distcp pipeline workflow to allow for work units to be split by the CopySource into block level work units which are then merged after copying by the CopyDataPublisher.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Added some unit tests including testing of non-filesystem related functionality of the added DistcpFileSplitter methods.\r\n    - I ran a split-enabled distcp job on a local pseudo distributed hdfs setup with a small file, kind of as a smoke test: it didn't actually use a split because the file was much smaller than the block size, but it completed successfully\r\n    - Tested with a job that successfully copied two 3gb files with block sizes of 512 mbs (verified copied files using hdfs dfs checksum)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-592\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin logs an ERROR when `failure.log.dir` is not defined. We want a way to suppress this since it is unnecessary noise for our users. I added a configuration key which can be used to disable the file-based failure reporter. Similar configuration keys exist for other reporters.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDo not have an easy way to write unit tests as the only side effect of the configuration key is visible in `GobblinMetrics.codahaleScheduledReporters` which is private\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-583\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen a partition with a schema file is reregistered there is a window where the file does not exist and a new file is created, permissions are set, then the schema is written.\r\n\r\nReduce this window by adding support to stage the file creation, permission setting, and schema write in a temporary file. Then delete the target file and replace with the temp file.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-582\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, we disallow overwriting contents of task output when copying contents from task staging dir to output dir.  This can be a problem when a task fails after the commit step is successful. Subsequent task attempts fail during the commit step as they attempt to copy data from staging to output dir, which results in a job failure. We provide an option to force overwriting contents of the task output directory for such scenarios and let the job succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan a distcp job in test environment. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin-571 JsonIntermediateToParquetGroupConverter generates wrong parquet schema for complex types such as enums, arrays and maps](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-571)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] For complex types such as arrays, maps and enums `JsonIntermediateToParquetGroupConverter` is generating wrong schema. For enums, arrays and maps the OPTIONAL and REQUIRED attribute of the SchemaField is messed up.\r\n\r\nDue to this spark throws the following errors when reading parquet files generated using JsonIntermediateToParquetGroupConverter\r\n```sh\r\nCaused by: parquet.io.ParquetDecodingException: Can not read value at 0 \r\n```\r\nEx of a wrong schema generated is below. Notice the field `payload.action is marked as required`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmessage EventData {\r\noptional int64 id;\r\noptional binary type (UTF8);\r\nrequired group actor {\r\noptional int64 id;\r\noptional binary login (UTF8);\r\noptional binary gravatar_id (UTF8);\r\noptional binary url (UTF8);\r\noptional binary avatar_url (UTF8);\r\n}\r\nrequired group repo {\r\noptional int64 id;\r\noptional binary name (UTF8);\r\noptional binary url (UTF8);\r\noptional binary urlid (UTF8);\r\n}\r\nrequired group payload {\r\noptional int64 id;\r\noptional binary ref (UTF8);\r\noptional binary ref_type (UTF8);\r\noptional binary master_branch (UTF8);\r\noptional binary description (UTF8);\r\noptional binary pusher_type (UTF8);\r\noptional binary before (UTF8);\r\nrequired binary action (UTF8);\r\n}\r\noptional boolean public;\r\noptional binary created_at (UTF8);\r\noptional binary created_at_id (UTF8);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut the field `payload.action` which is defined in the `source.schema` property is set to `isNullable: true`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[ ....\r\n    {\r\n    \"columnName\": \"payload\",\r\n    \"dataType\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"record\",\r\n      \"name\": \"payloadDetails\",\r\n      \"values\": [\r\n        ....\r\n        {\r\n          \"columnName\": \"action\",\r\n          \"isNullable\": true,\r\n          \"dataType\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"enum\",\r\n            \"name\": \"actionType\",\r\n            \"symbols\": [\r\n              \"started\",\r\n              \"published\",\r\n              \"opened\",\r\n              \"closed\",\r\n              \"created\",\r\n              \"reopened\",\r\n              \"added\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }....\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] org.apache.gobblin.parquet.converter.JsonIntermediateToParquetGroupConverterTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T07:13:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T19:52:36Z","closed_at":"2019-12-18T19:52:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"992995384e5c2cf4c8d8d914593d15df748807ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e24c3797f7d1263d0e0e70c16087d3cd713f3cd0","head":{"label":"tilakpatidar:parquet_schema_fix","ref":"parquet_schema_fix","sha":"e24c3797f7d1263d0e0e70c16087d3cd713f3cd0","user":{"login":"tilakpatidar","id":8450471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTA0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8450471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar","html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98888959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODg4ODk1OQ==","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"tilakpatidar/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tilakpatidar","id":8450471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTA0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8450471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar","html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] [GOBBLIN-568](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-568) FsDataWriter lacks support for multiple files per partition using record count or block size \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Currently, FsDataWriter does not support writing multiple files per partition. As a result, a huge file is getting generated per partition. If someone is using file formats such as parquet it is not advisable.\r\n- [x] `org.apache.gobblin.writer.MultipleFilesFsDataWriter` extends `org.apache.gobblin.writer.FsDataWriter` to provide a wrapper around `org.apache.gobblin.writer.FsDataWriter` so that new writers can be instantiated once a threshold of records per file is reached. This can be configured using `ConfigurationKeys.WRITER_RECORDS_PER_FILE_THRESHOLD`\r\n- [x] `org.apache.gobblin.writer.MultipleFilesFsDataWriterBuilder` provides a way to build such a writer. However, the user has to implement in the builder how to instantiate the new writer `MultipleFilesFsDataWriterBuilder::getNewWriter`.\r\n- [x] As an example to build such writers in future refer `org.apache.gobblin.writer.ParquetMultipleFilesHdfsDataWriter` and `org.apache.gobblin.writer.ParquetMultipleFilesDataWriterBuilder`. They demonstrate how to build a writer where new files will be opened whenever the record count threshold is reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] `org.apache.gobblin.writer.MultipleFilesFsDataWriterTest`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-26T14:25:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T12:26:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9d43ee9ed536ccd7f62671ce76b20b418f5e8764","head":{"label":"tilakpatidar:multiple_files_fs_writer","ref":"multiple_files_fs_writer","sha":"9d43ee9ed536ccd7f62671ce76b20b418f5e8764","user":{"login":"tilakpatidar","id":8450471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTA0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8450471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar","html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98888959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODg4ODk1OQ==","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"tilakpatidar/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tilakpatidar","id":8450471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTA0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8450471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar","html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilakpatidar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tilakpatidar/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-564\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n  - A partition descriptor refers to a partition of a dataset. The task to implement partition level lineage depends on this. \r\n  - For example, a dataset descriptor points to a hdfs dataset `/data/tracking/PageViewEvent`. A partition descriptor points to `/data/tracking/PageViewEvent/hourly/2018/08/15/16`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - `DescriptorTest`\r\n  - `DatasetResolverTest`\r\n  - `LineageEventTest#testEventForPartitionedDataset`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally we are using `EmptyKey` as the key for HiveConf as we assume that each Gobblin should only talk to single Hive Metastore, however this assumption is not fair

Implement FlowGraph as a concurrent data structure.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-559.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent implementation of FlowGraph only allows a single-threaded access to the data structure for reads and writes. We improve the implementation by allowing the readers to not block on other readers, and only block on a write.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests in MultiHopFlowCompilerTest class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-560 Partitioner for Parquet records](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-560) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Currently,`gobblin-parquet` module has a parquet writer but no default partitioner to partition the parquet records by a given key present in the record.\r\n- [x] Supports partitioning by nested keys as well.\r\n- [x] Following properties are used to configure `org.apache.gobblin.partitioner.ParquetPartitioner`\r\n```properties\r\nwriter.partitioner.class=org.apache.gobblin.partitioner.ParquetPartitioner\r\nwriter.partitioner.parquet.key=\"type,payload.pusher_type\"\r\nwriter.partitioner.parquet.defaultKey=default_part\r\nwriter.builder.class=org.apache.gobblin.writer.ParquetDataWriterBuilder\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [x] Updated existing `org.apache.gobblin.example.githubjsontoparquet.EmbeddedGithubJsonToParquet` example in `gobblin-examples` to use `org.apache.gobblin.partitioner.ParquetPartitioner`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] org.apache.gobblin.partitioner.ParquetPartitionerTest\r\n- [x] org.apache.gobblin.partitioner.PartitionKey\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Change signature of SpecCompiler#compileFlow() to return a DAG of JobSpecs instead of a HashMap.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-554\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, SpecCompiler#compileFlow() returns a Map<Spec, SpecExecutor>. To better capture dependencies between JobSpecs in a flow, we now return a DAG of jobs for orchestration by Gobblin-as-a-Service (GaaS). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nModified unit tests for each implementation of SpecCompiler.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-02T23:42:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T16:41:17Z","closed_at":"2018-08-09T16:41:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83e6c95334bda77a00a5ffa3540a5388db10a1fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9dfebb731ca430beaab8ccfeb0b1c5a4ad226422","head":{"label":"sv2000:dag1","ref":"dag1","sha":"9dfebb731ca430beaab8ccfeb0b1c5a4ad226422","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-552\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe enhance the MultiHopFlowCompiler to specify multiple destinations via the gobblin.flow.destinationIdentifier key. The flow compiler iterates over each destination and computes a path from the source to that destination.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test to FlowGraphPathFinderTest class.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-02T05:30:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T05:02:45Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T05:02:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a1f1adf2ed5d8313f388d538c0d6ae908483b03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3e11bc46c3c5a2c9fd09659cb01123b006998480","head":{"label":"sv2000:multicast","ref":"multicast","sha":"3e11bc46c3c5a2c9fd09659cb01123b006998480","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-551] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-551\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nJdbcExtractor code in gobblin-sql module uses separate data connection every time it uses executeSql & executePreparedSql. The issue manifested while using SQL Server over proxy as one of the connection is active/open when the JDBC source is closed. After closing the proxy tunnel it becomes a memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-01T21:59:07Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T20:26:48Z","closed_at":"2018-08-02T20:26:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91b379d652ea2230e5a67a0933ff5c3a46930b39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/92c8883077908a691c2f97ac6b6ade6a08967538","head":{"label":"mvachhani:master","ref":"master","sha":"92c8883077908a691c2f97ac6b6ade6a08967538","user":{"login":"mvachhani","id":8334305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani","html_url":"https://github.com/mvachhani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143204672,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMyMDQ2NzI=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"mvachhani/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mvachhani","id":8334305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani","html_url":"https://github.com/mvachhani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvachhani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mvachhani/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

table alteration only update the existing schema and alter table with that instead of altering with the new table as it causes hive schema evolution error because the indexes won't match with the old and new schema columns which cause schema incompatibility error. \r\nI think the issue is due to this in Hive:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/20eb7b516f373f42b07f979ba03363c116adb99c/standalone-metastore/metastore-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveAlterHandler.java#L933\r\n\r\nInstead of this in my fix, it calls the updateSchema and uses the table from that to alter the table which will mean in this case that only the URL to the underlying Avro schema will change.\r\n\r\nDear
