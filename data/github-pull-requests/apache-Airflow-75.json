Therefore, I am questioning the two methods logic (which I still didn't figure out). I found the introduction of those two methods in #17414 (Hello @uranusjr 👋 ). Do we really need to compute the `delta` with `scheduled` and `naive` variables? This is error prone since, during a [DST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DST_(disambiguation)#:~:text=DST%20is%20daylight%20saving%20time%2C%20a%20seasonal%20adjustment%20to%20civil%20time.), the delta will not be coherent? If I am missing something, I think we would really benefit from documentation + tests on those two methods.\r\n\r\n###$ Before my changes:\r\n```\r\nthe 28 at 20:

requested the same PR about 1 hour ago but I closed the PR by my mistake. I am sorry. you can delete the closed PR. The PR is same as this.\r\n\r\nDuring setting Breeze environment according to guide of CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst),\r\nI got error below at installing Breeze with pipx part.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/55989852/feb6ac96-d3fb-4906-a62a-efcaab6918ad)\r\nMy airflow-env(virtual python env)'s python version is 3.8.5 as suggested in above guide doc. \r\nAnd My local machine's global python version is 3.12.0.\r\nBoth version is installed and set by pyenv and my OS is Mac/Intel\r\n\r\nI don't know the exact principle of pipx but I think that it uses its own python version when Installing something(I am not sure). So I solve this error by adding '--python $(which python)' option so that I can make pipx use the python version of my airflow-env.\r\n\r\nI am not sure others will meet the same error,. If my PR is not appropriate I will be thankful for any feedback\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

setting Breeze environment according to guide of CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst),\r\nI got this error below at installing Breeze with pipx part.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/55989852/feb6ac96-d3fb-4906-a62a-efcaab6918ad)\r\nMy airflow-env(virtual python env)'s python version is 3.8.5 as suggested in above guide doc. \r\nAnd My local machine's global python version is 3.12.0.\r\nBoth version is installed and set by pyenv and my OS is Mac/Intel\r\n\r\nI don't know the exact principle of pipx but I think that it uses its own python version when Installing something(I am not sure). So I solve this error by adding '--python $(which python)' option so that I can make pipx use the python version of my airflow-env.\r\n\r\nI am not sure others will meet the same error,. If my PR is not appropriate, I will be thankful for any feedback. \r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

prepare-provider-packages to be run entirely in Breeze Python\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up after https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35586 and it depends on this one. It\r\nmoves the whole functionality of preparing provider packages to\r\nbreeze, removing the need of doing it in the Breeze CI image.\r\n\r\nSince we have Python breeze with its own environment managed via\r\npipx we can now make sure that all the necessary packages are\r\ninstalled in this environment and run package building in the\r\nsame environment Breeze uses.\r\n\r\nPreviously we have been running all the package building inside the\r\nCI image for two reasons:\r\n\r\nwe could rely on the same version of build tools (wheel/setuptools)\r\nbeing installed in the CI image\r\nsecurity of the provider package preparation that used setuptools\r\npre PEP-517 way of building packages that executed setup.py code\r\nIn order to isolate execution of potentially arbitrary code\r\nin setup.py from the HOST environment in CI - where the host\r\nenvironment might have access to secrets and tokens that would allow\r\nit to break out of the sandbox for PRs coming from forks. The setup.py\r\nfile has been prepared by breeze using JINJA templates but it was\r\npotentially possible to manipulate provider package directory structure\r\nand get \"Python\" injection into generated setup.py, so it was safer\r\nto run it in the isolated Breeze CI environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it secure to run it in the Host environment,\r\nbecause instead of generating setup.cfg and setup.py we generate\r\npyproject.toml with all the necessary information and we are using\r\nPEP-517 compliant way of building provider packages - no arbitrary\r\ncode executed via setup.py is possible this way on the host,\r\nso we can safely build provider packages in the host. We are\r\ngenerating declarative pyproject.toml for that rather than imperative\r\nsetup.py, so we are safe to run the build process in the host without\r\nbeing afraid of executing arbitrary code.\r\n\r\nWe are using flit as build tool - this is one of the popular build\r\ntools - created by Python Packaging team. It is simple and not\r\ntoo opinionated, it supports PEP-517 as well as PEP-621, so most of\r\nthe project mnetadata in pyproject toml can be added to PEP-621\r\ncompliant \"project\" section of pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nTogether with the change we improves the process of generation of the\r\nextracted sources for the providers. Originally we copied the whole\r\nsources of Airflow to a single directory (provider_packages) and run\r\nsequentially provider packages building from that single directory,\r\nhowever it made it impossible to parallelise such builds - all\r\nproviders had to be built sequentially.\r\n\r\nWe change the approach now - instead of copying all airflow\r\nsources once to the single directory, we build providers in separate\r\nsubdirectories of files/provider_packages/PROVIDER_ID and we only\r\ncopy there relevant sources (i.e. only provider's subfolder from\r\nthe \"airflow/providers\". This is quite a bit faster (each provider\r\nonly gets built using only its own sources so just scanning the\r\ndirectory is faster) but it also allows to run package preparation\r\nin parallel because each provider is fully isolated from others.\r\n\r\nThis PR also excludes not-needed prepare_providers_package.py\r\nand unneded provider_packages folder used to prepare providers\r\nbefore as well as bash script to build the providers and some\r\nunused bash functions.\r\n\r\nThis change requires https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35586 to be merged first - only last commit\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

prepare-provider-packages to be run entirely in Breeze Python\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up after #35586 and it depends on this one. It\r\nmoves the whole functionality of preparing provider packages to\r\nbreeze, removing the need of doing it in the Breeze CI image.\r\n\r\nSince we have Python breeze with its own environment managed via\r\n`pipx` we can now make sure that all the necessary packages are\r\ninstalled in this environment and run package building in the\r\nsame environment Breeze uses.\r\n\r\nPreviously we have been running all the package building inside the\r\nCI image for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* we could rely on the same version of build tools (wheel/setuptools)\r\n  being installed in the CI image\r\n* security of the provider package preparation that used setuptools\r\n  pre PEP-517 way of building packages that executed setup.py code\r\n\r\nIn order to isolate execution of potentially arbitrary code\r\nin setup.py from the HOST environment in CI - where the host\r\nenvironment might have access to secrets and tokens that would allow\r\nit to break out of the sandbox for PRs coming from forks. The setup.py\r\nfile has been prepared by breeze using JINJA templates but it was\r\npotentially possible to manipulate provider package directory structure\r\nand get \"Python\" injection into generated setup.py, so it was safer\r\nto run it in the isolated Breeze CI environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it secure to run it in the Host environment,\r\nbecause instead of generating setup.cfg and setup.py we generate\r\npyproject.toml with all the necessary information and we are using\r\nPEP-517 compliant way of building provider packages - no arbitrary\r\ncode executed via setup.py is possible this way on the host,\r\nso we can safely build provider packages in the host. We are\r\ngenerating declarative pyproject.toml for that rather than imperative\r\nsetup.py, so we are safe to run the build process in the host without\r\nbeing afraid of executing arbitrary code.\r\n\r\nWe are using flit as build tool - this is one of the popular build\r\ntools - created by Python Packaging team. It is simple and not\r\ntoo opinionated, it supports PEP-517 as well as PEP-621, so most of\r\nthe project mnetadata in pyproject toml can be added to PEP-621\r\ncompliant \"project\" section of pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nTogether with the change we improves the process of generation of the\r\nextracted sources for the providers. Originally we copied the whole\r\nsources of Airflow to a single directory (provider_packages) and run\r\nsequentially provider packages building from that single directory,\r\nhowever it made it impossible to parallelise such builds - all\r\nproviders had to be built sequentially.\r\n\r\nWe change the approach now - instead of copying all airflow\r\nsources once to the single directory, we build providers in separate\r\nsubdirectories of files/provider_packages/PROVIDER_ID and we only\r\ncopy there relevant sources (i.e. only provider's subfolder from\r\nthe \"airflow/providers\". This is quite a bit faster (each provider\r\nonly gets built using only its own sources so just scanning the\r\ndirectory is faster) but it also allows to run package preparation\r\nin parallel because each provider is fully isolated from others.\r\n\r\nThis PR also excludes not-needed `prepare_providers_package.py`\r\nand unneded `provider_packages` folder used to prepare providers\r\nbefore as well as bash script to build the providers and some\r\nunused bash functions.\r\n\r\nThis change requires #35586 to bemerged first - only last commit\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\nor more contributor license agreements.

refactors the object storage implementation to \r\ninherit from UPath and therefore from pathlib.Path. \r\nThis makes its behavior semantically stricter and\r\nlowers the maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the refactoring includes moving\r\nObjectStoragePath up a level to `airflow.io.path` making\r\nit more intuitive to import.\r\n\r\nWork is underway to allow storage_options to be passed\r\ndirectly to the underlying filesystem.\r\n\r\ncc: @jscheffl @Taragolis @uranusjr \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor

Changing to cbreak mode will maintain most of the features of raw mode, except that keystrokes like `Ctrl-C` will be interpreted by the terminal and will interrupt.\r\nBesides that, a handler for `SIGINT` is added so that the signal is simply passed to the subprocess (instead of causing a KeyboardInterrupt.)\r\nThis at least partially fixes #26186, because now hitting Ctrl-C will cause psql

thing I’ve been cooking…\r\n\r\nThis is heavily inspired by the Object Store. Internally it just calls to hooks, but allows you to do\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.providers.common.sql.db import Database\r\n\r\ndb = Database(conn_id=\"my-db-conn\")\r\nhook = db.create_hook(...)  # Additional flags to hook.\r\n\r\ndb = Database.default(protocol=\"sqlite3\")  # Use default conn defined by the provider.\r\nwith db.connect(...) as conn:  # Shorthand for db.create_hook(...).get_conn() with management.\r\n    conn.execute(\"SELECT 1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefinition is currently provided for SQLite. More will be added once the interface is figured out.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOne thought on this to @bolkedebruin: Does the Object Store intend to cover non-file sources in the future? If it does, that should take precedence over this. But if not, I feel we should rename it to something less generic, maybe IO Store or File Store instead, since SQL databases are also a kind of object storage (for a certain definition of objects) but don’t fit into the current Object Store

But now, `auth_kwargs` and `auth_type` are also being written over there, which I don't find very convenient. Furthermore, this PR add logic to exclude those keys from the Headers (IMO this start to be a bit of tech-debt). And finally, user cannot pass a header named like those keys (it is unlikely, but it could happen).\r\n\r\nThus, I propose to deprecate headers parameters passed directly in the 'Extra' field. And to pass them via a dedicated \"Headers\" field. \r\n\r\nUI:\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-01-05 09-05-03](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/17571457/0a95a361-cbc6-441d-9c2b-914e28814e10)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-01-05 09-04-59](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/17571457/c9e384e4-1690-434c-8ec9-f25efde03677)\r\n\r\nSide effect:\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-01-05 09-11-34](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/17571457/7b62be72-6b71-4332-ba9a-e9f6373dd146)\r\n\r\nI also tried to add a [CodeMirrorField](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35591/commits/53672f039011d740af67a70657292df07cc14c03) (for Headers and Auth kwargs), and a [CollapsibleField](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35591/commits/da4ef3b19c9a36a409bad7c5d5b3e5f333a654cb) (to hide Extra), but it was a bit too much compared to the initial goal of this PR. Maybe in a future one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Use-case:**\r\n\r\nThe `auth_type` is typically a subclass of [`request.AuthBase`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/839a8edec37c81a18ac8332cfbd44f44e1ae6206/src/requests/auth.py#L69). Many custom Auth classes exist for many different protocols. Sometimes, passing only two hard-coded `conn.username` and `conn.password` is not enough: The Auth class expects more than two arguments.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- [OAuth2 from requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/blob/master/requests_oauthlib/oauth2_auth.py), which can take a token as third argument\r\n- [HTTPKerberosAuth from requests-kerberos](https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos/blob/master/requests_kerberos/kerberos_.py), which can take much more than two arguments\r\n\r\nRight now, to deal with those cases, they are three possibilities:\r\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\r\n<li>Using <code>functools.partial</code>, like <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29206#discussion_r1136503816\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/apache/airflow/pull/29206/hovercard\">mentioned in this PR</a>, in the dag file / in the operator declaration. <br><em>Opinion</em>: The dag developer should not care about handling the connection. He just want a working connection_id to call an endpoint (especially if its a beginner / low-experienced dev). Furthermore, some parameters are sensitive and cannot be written in a dag.</li>\r\n<li>Writing a custom Hook, which dispatch the parameters from the Connection correctly (eventually using partial). <br><em>Opinion</em>: This is not okay. Other hooks are doing better. Take the ODBCHook, which allows to parameterize every aspect of the connection without subclassing anything:\r\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\r\n<li>Defining which driver has to be used</li>\r\n<li>Defining connection schema for SQLAlchemy</li>\r\n<li>Parameterize the driver via extra driver-specific parameters</li>\r\n<li>Parameterize the behavior of pyodbc (<code class=\"notranslate\">\"connect_kwargs\"</code>).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEverything can be controlled in the Connection UI ! I'd expect the HttpHook to behave similarly, and let me configure everything, which includes the underlying authentication.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Misusing the \"username\" and \"password\" fields of a Connection, to stack and pass multiple parameters in it + implementing a thin layer on top of a Auth class to re-dispatch the parameters. <br><em>Opinion</em>: This is definitively a bad workaround. I'm mentioning it because this PR won't entirely solve the issue, and this may (continue to) happen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nComing to this PR, I propose to add two reserved field: \"auth_type\" and \"auth_kwargs\", which are passed to the underlying Auth class. No breaking change. This solve _most_ of the issues: a partial is not needed anymore, a subclass is not needed anymore, and there are less cases where conn.username and conn.password will be misused.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please

PR moves the functionality of preparing provider documentation from a python script inside Breeze CI image to breeze Python package.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the series of moves that will simplify the way how provider packages are being built and prepared with the aim of improving security of the supply chain and make it easier to debug and modify the release process.\r\n\r\nHistorically, release process has been run inside of Breeze for several reasons: isolation of running package preparation from Host environment, the need to keep separate virtualenv and because we run verification of provider packages during release process - which requires the CI environment with all its dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo far the process looked like this:\r\n\r\n* bash breeze parsed the arguments\r\n* bash breeze started the docker bash script with packages as parameters\r\n* the bash script in CI image looped over the packages and run python prepare_provider_packages.py (twice) to generate docs and update changelog (this is interactive process where release manager makes decision on bumping versions). Those python script performed verification on provider.yaml files\r\n* the bash script summarized the packages and displayed status of preparation\r\n\r\nHowever after moving to Python based breeze, we can simplify it all and run all those steps in Python breeze internal code - no need to go to docker and use bash scripts. We also do not have to do verification of provider.yaml files is done already extensively in pre-commit.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves all this logic to inside Breeze.\r\n\r\nThere is stil remainig duplicated code in the original in-container `prepare_provider_packages.py` remaining, this duplication will be removed by subsequent PRs where other release management commands for provider packages will also be moved to Breeze as follow-up of this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has the following changes:\r\n\r\n* move the provider decumentation code from `dev/provider_packages` to `dev/breeze/` (and from in-container to in-breeze-venv execution)\r\n* completely removed the intermediate bash script and calling Python scripts from it - moving the logic to Breeze entirely\r\n* added better diagnostics of what happens when packages are classified with particular types of changes (added `special` style to show it)\r\n* cleaned and clarified `prepare-provider-documentation` commmand line flags\r\n* introduce explicit \"non-interactive\" mode that is used to run and test the command in CI and to test it locally\r\n* replace str with Path were files were used in the moved code\r\n* add unit tests covering unit-testable parts of the moved code\r\n* refactore the moved code to use utils available in Breeze\r\n* split the code into packages and versions (reusable utils) and specific code for preparing package documentation\r\n* cached provider.yaml information retrieved from providers\r\n* move provider documentation templates to Breeze\r\n* better error handling - they are now regular exceptions in Python process rather than interpreting the exit_codes passed from python sub-scripts returnig the codes to Bash\r\n* when release manager classifies package, only relevant sections are generated (Features/Breaking changes) based on decision and changes are automatically \"guessed\" only if release manager chose the section where they would fall in\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

have a scheduler house keeping work (adopt_or_reset_orphaned_tasks, check_trigger_timeouts, _emit_pool_metrics, _find_zombies, clear_not_launched_queued_tasks and _check_worker_pods_pending_timeout) runs on certain frequency. Right now, we don't have any latency metrics on these house keeping work. These will impact the scheduler heartbeat. Its good idea to capture these latency metrics to identify and tune the airflow configuration\r\n\r\nUse case/motivation\r\n\r\nAs we run the airflow at a large scale, we have found that the adopt_or_reset_orphaned_tasks and clear_not_launched_queued_tasks functions might take time in a few minutes prior to bug fix (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34877). These will delay the heartbeat of the scheduler and leads to the scheduler instance restarting/killed. In order to detect these latency issues, we need metrics to capture these latencies.\r\n\r\ncloses:

hovering over the Airflow logo in the top left, the pinwheel part of the logo cuts across the text part of the logo. This is (subjectively) poor design. In order to stop this from happening, while keeping the pinwheel animation, this PR has:\r\n\r\n- set text to transition slightly to the right when the animation activates.\r\n\r\nI have also set the pinwheel animation back to infinite. In my opinion, having read the [discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34019) that resulted in the change, it was not the correct decision to switch the animation from infinite over hover to 1.5 seconds. Another change was made, to allow users with a 'prefers-reduced-motion' preference to not have the animation playing, was the correct change, and did not need a further change to the length of time the pinwheel animates for.\r\n\r\nThis is a design change, which is always subjective, so totally understand if review wants to bin this.

are 4 layers of security managers:\r\n- `airflow.www.fab_security.manager.BaseSecurityManager`\r\n- `airflow.www.fab_security.sqla.manager.SecurityManager`\r\n- `airflow.www.security_manager.AirflowSecurityManagerV2`\r\n- `airflow.auth.managers.fab.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`\r\n\r\nThe first 3 layers of security managers are in core Airflow. As part of AIP-56, we moved quite a lot of methods/properties from these security managers to the FAB security manager override (`airflow.auth.managers.fab.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`). Thus, the first 3 layers start getting smaller and I dont see any value keeping them separated in 3 different files. The end goal is to merge the first 3 layers of security managers into one (`airflow.www.security_manager.AirflowSecurityManagerV2`).

recent changes where we largely switched to use primarily short version of packages rather than `apache-airflow-providers-*` and filters, there were several places where get_available_packages family of method have been used inconsistently in various breeze commands.\r\n\r\nThis change consolidates it all to commong way, it also replaces the inconsistent `providers-index` with regular\r\n\"apache-airlfow-providers\" - which is now not-ambiguous since the package filters usage is not that much used any more.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

a follow-up after #35511 it turned out that we have THREE tests which are named Test_BranchDecoratedOperator - because they were copied originally from the \"Python\" one - there is a Python, ExternalPython and PythonVirtualenv tests :).\r\n\r\nThe #35551 only added timeout in one of them - and in the least problematic one at that (Python). This PR also adds it in the other tests and renames the tests classes to distinguish between the different tests (to more easily see which one failed).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

It only makes sense to naturally have the ability to enable the airflow kerberos init container in our helm charts while running the airflow worker with kerberos (the token would be refreshed when airflow starts).\r\n\r\nThis will also serve as an example to someone wanting to use airflow kerberos in this fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this is a new feature, we need to add it only in 2.8.0 and

Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR refines the `OpenAIEmbeddingOperator` to accurately reflect and support the extended range of input types it can handle for generating embeddings ([by OpenAI official API](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/42522942/b15eef98-dcb9-42a4-b828-fba8fa9a47d1)). The operator, which previously accepted a string or a list of any type, now has improved type annotations and validation to handle strings, lists of strings, lists of integers, and lists of lists of integers more explicitly.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Modified type annotations `str | list[Any]` to be [`str | list[str] | list[int] | list[list[int]]`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/42522942/b15eef98-dcb9-42a4-b828-fba8fa9a47d1)\r\n- Refined input validation to ensure `input_text` is non-empty and matches one of the expected types.\r\n- Expanded unit tests to cover the newly supported input types and to ensure the operator behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThe operator's enhanced input type support provides users with clearer guidance on what data can be passed for embedding generation. This update facilitates the use of the operator in a broader range of scenarios, such as processing numerical data or sequences of data, which is common in machine learning and NLP tasks.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n- Extended the test suite to include cases for each of the supported input types, ensuring robustness.\r\n- Added negative test cases to verify that the operator raises exceptions for

current serialization logic treats all of the `BaseOperator` fields as non-templateable by default. However, the `email` field may considered an exception to that rule and may be allowed to be templated.\r\n\r\nFor example, our team heavily relies on templating this field (e.g., `\"{{ var.value.some_email_list }}\"`) as the `default_args[\"email\"]` for each and every DAG we have, and we don't want to use `Variable.get(\"some_email_list\")` on the module level of our scripts instead because it's actually an anti-pattern (opening a DB connection and making a SQL query under the hood at parsing time and not at execution time).\r\n\r\nSee the discussion under https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29821 for more details.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

to #35473 - this test sometimes (very rarely) exceeds the default 60 seconds timeout when run in Paralllel test environment where we have multiple containers and multiple databases and multiple parallel tests runnign at the same time on single virtual machine (in order to maximise the gains from parallelism).\r\n\r\nThis test sometimes fails with **just** above 60 seconds, so following the

that if you have some older dependencies they might have problems with newer configurations (for example pre-commit). Since Breeze has it's own, isolated virtualenv managed by pipx, we can safely install latest versions of dependencies without being afraid of conflicts (Breeze environment is fully isolated so it has nothing to conflict with).\r\n\r\nThis PR updates minimum versions for all dependencies of Breeze to latest non-conflicting versions of those. Since Breeze has the self-upgrade mechanism built in, it should detect and reinstall itself for everyone who checks out the latest main and runs breeze command.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`breeze setup regenerate-command-images` used hash calculation to determine when to regenerate commands. There was only one file with hashes for all commands which often cause conflicts if several people changed adjacent commands. Also when one of the subcommands changed, this immediately invalidated the \"parent\" command where the subcommand was, however such invalidation is only needed if a new subcommand is added or if name or help description of the subcommand changes - because this is the only information displayed in the parent command.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves hash calculation and verification and calculation to avoid conflicts as much as possible. The hash will only have conflict when the same command is modified by the same people in parallel (signifying that indeed you need to regenerate the image for that command). This is achieved by:\r\n\r\n* splitting hashes to separate files - each command has its own .txt file where hash of the command is kept\r\n\r\n* when hash of the group command is calculated, only name and help text of the subcommands for the group are used to calculate hash\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR introduces the AWS auth manager. The target is to create an auth manager using AWS services: AWS Identity center and Amazon Verified Permissions. This PR handles the login and logout mechanism. Other features such as authorization will come in a separate PR. The auth manager wont be usable as such because of missing feature but since it is not documented anywhere, it should not be used by users. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
