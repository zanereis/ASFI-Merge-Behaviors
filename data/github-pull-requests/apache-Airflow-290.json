In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-24T12:28:01Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T11:00:39Z","closed_at":"2017-11-26T14:36:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a30fcd901143d39751e94e46001b460a0a871d8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3cffdd29fd6df2e8e53e92e1062c9f5f005d5a8c","head":{"label":"ashb:AIRFLOW-1845-modal-background-on-long-pages","ref":"AIRFLOW-1845-modal-background-on-long-pages","sha":"3cffdd29fd6df2e8e53e92e1062c9f5f005d5a8c","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

I changed it to simple String by substituting False to None since in the operator and the hook, code checks only for presence of value in a variable.\r\nMake it more predictable by using simpler String type rather than Union of String and Bool.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt doesn't add new fuctionality.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

This makes the configuration more transparant.\r\n- Make sure that the celery_ssl_active is set in the config, otherwise you get a lot of errors in the logs:\r\n```\r\n[2017-11-22 15:10:01,779] {configuration.py:206} WARNING - section/key [celery/celery_ssl_active] not found in config\r\n[2017-11-22 15:10:01,780] {default_celery.py:40} WARNING - Celery Executor will run without SSL\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested the configuration on acceptance using Celery 4.1\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-21T00:46:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T21:25:01Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T21:25:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6805a1521df0f7de4066ed862cca0efd31e2c570","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3cb857bf388a20513c681bbdafaf23f4ffeb0f8d","head":{"label":"bovard:variable_files_are_json","ref":"variable_files_are_json","sha":"3cb857bf388a20513c681bbdafaf23f4ffeb0f8d","user":{"login":"bovard","id":997017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard","html_url":"https://github.com/bovard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103707301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MDczMDE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"bovard/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bovard","id":997017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NzAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/997017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard","html_url":"https://github.com/bovard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bovard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bovard/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

The important thing that was missing was\r\n  ability to get the key name from the return a call to get_wildcard_key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: already covered by existing tests, updated some slightly to correctly test boto3 instead of mocking out boto2 responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-17T12:11:32Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T08:44:02Z","closed_at":"2017-11-18T13:08:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f153bae46e03cbec4f5daddba5566c0da8fa817b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3c697c4b6ccea416692d2a1af53d2729754a423c","head":{"label":"ashb:AIRFLOW-1795-s3hook_boto3_fixes","ref":"AIRFLOW-1795-s3hook_boto3_fixes","sha":"3c697c4b6ccea416692d2a1af53d2729754a423c","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1821\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- The default_logging_config file has 5 loggers: root, airflow, airflow.task, airflow.task_runner, airflow.processor. This could be simplified to root, airflow.task, and airflow.processor given python logging inheritance. (Noe that this requires a directory structure change from airflow/task_runner/ → airflow/task/task_runner/)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\ncc @bolkedebruin @Fokko @allisonwang @criccomini \r\n\r\nI think there are still room for simplifying the logging setup further, but which may require a bigger discussion. This PR focuses on preventing folks from making the mistakes that we did, by removing some surface area for logger configuration that could otherwise lead to confusion.","created_at":"2017-11-16T04:23:42Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T13:08:13Z","closed_at":"2017-12-22T13:08:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aaaaed90be7b14239817bcf7a9aba8387967d26d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c75574cb65df9070b72ff696b7b91dcfb6006d6e","head":{"label":"jgao54:logging-enhancement","ref":"logging-enhancement","sha":"c75574cb65df9070b72ff696b7b91dcfb6006d6e","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54232830,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDIzMjgzMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jgao54/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54/airflow","description":"Airflow

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-868\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1613\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of an existing (possibly abandoned) PR, #2071 which fixes [AIRFLOW-863](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-868), to include more unittests as was requested as well as fix a python3 compatibility issue I was running into (I also fixed this for mysql).\r\n\r\nSince writing tests to be compatible in 2.7 and 3 required fixing a python3 issue which was copied from the mysql_to_gcs_operator (see: [AIRFLOW-1613](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1613)) I added the fix for the mysql_to_gcs_operator here as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nHas unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"","created_at":"2017-11-14T00:20:10Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T00:55:04Z","closed_at":"2017-11-27T18:56:38Z","merged_at":"2017-11-27T18:56:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8fa2e9049328341dc58a635b34f04fa52de543e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d8fa2e9049328341dc58a635b34f04fa52de543e","head":{"label":"x:postgres_to_bigquery_operator","ref":"postgres_to_bigquery_operator","sha":"d8fa2e9049328341dc58a635b34f04fa52de543e","user":{"login":"x","id":693546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzU0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x","html_url":"https://github.com/x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109890512,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk4OTA1MTI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"x/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"x","id":693546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzU0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x","html_url":"https://github.com/x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/x/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1813\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] The SSH Operator currently throws an empty \"SSH operator error\" when running commands\r\nthat do not immediately log something to the terminal. This is due to a call to\r\nstdout.channel.recv when the channel currently has a 0-size buffer, either because\r\nthe command has not yet logged anything, or never will (e.g. sleep 5). Fixed this issue with a buffer\r\nsize check.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Made code PEP8 compliant\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Added test for shell commands with no stdout output\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-13T13:44:46Z","updated_at":"2017-11-13T15:02:11Z","closed_at":"2017-11-13T15:02:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4cb054cee0409cdf7d1b7962ec942bb93d02ba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e4dc699c05a6d353d6b3ee23f19327b1e0174f79","head":{"label":"RJKeevil:fix-ssh-operator-no-terminal-output","ref":"fix-ssh-operator-no-terminal-output","sha":"e4dc699c05a6d353d6b3ee23f19327b1e0174f79","user":{"login":"RJKeevil","id":10771606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil","html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109291689,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkyOTE2ODk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"RJKeevil/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RJKeevil","id":10771606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil","html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1801\r\n\r\nPart of: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-288\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nExecution dates can contain special characters that\r\nneed to be url encoded.

Instead of logging the warning, it instead logs an obscure string formatting error:\r\n```\r\nLogged from file models.py, line 2159\r\nTraceback (most recent call last): \r\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py\", line 859, in emit msg = self.format(record) \r\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py\", line 732, in format return fmt.format(record) \r\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py\", line 471, in format record.message = record.getMessage() \r\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py\", line 335, in getMessage msg = msg % self.args \r\nTypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: This is a trivial fix to a logging message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere was a typo when instantiating the DockerHook from `docker_conn_id` using `base_url` instead of `docker_url`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe test `test_execute_with_docker_conn_id_use_hook` exists already.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-09T21:00:14Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T13:00:16Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T23:52:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7acfdc96c7639669d820df0e81889319228d4030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1756\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] The change from boto2 to boto3 in S3Hook caused this to break (the\r\nreturn type of `hook.get_key()` changed. There's a better method\r\ndesigned for that we should use anyway.\r\n\r\n  This wasn't caught by the tests as the mocks weren't updated. Rather\r\nthan mocking the return of the hook I have changed it to use \"moto\"\r\n(already in use elsewhere in the tests) to mock at the S3 layer, not\r\nour hook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: expands on the tests in test_s3_task_handler.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1797\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] With the switch to Boto3 (#2532) we now need the content to be bytes, not a string. On Python2 there is no difference, but for Python3 this matters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: New tests/hooks/test_s3_hook.py file covering load_string and read_key. Moved one existing test out of tests/core.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1789\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - Logging of SSHOperator was added in issue AIRFLOW-1712\r\n    - In github #2686 issue it was asked that stderr should be logged to log.warning. This issue implements this functionality:\r\n        - stdout is logged to log.info\r\n        - stderr is logged to log.warning\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - There are already SSHOperator tests to assert that do_xcom_push keeps saving output.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1780\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFix long task output lines with unicode from hanging parent process. Tasks that create output that gets piped into a file in the parent airflow process would hang if they had long lines with unicode characters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested by cherrypicking onto Airbnb production:\r\nThis is a bit tricky to test since it depends on OS-specific constants, and is likely caused by a bug in python 2.7/string format (not in Airflow itself).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@saguziel

But even if we blacklist fulldirectory the os.walk will still go through them no matter how deep they are and skip files one by one, which can be an issue when you keep around big .git or virtualvenv directories.\r\nThis PR add skipping directories that should be ignored and unified code a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: n/a\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1779\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Make use of paramiko's set_keepalive method to send keepalive packets every\r\nkeepalive_interval seconds.  This will prevent long running queries with no terminal\r\noutput from being termanated as idle, for example by an intermediate NAT.\r\n- [ ] Set on by default with a 30 second interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Small extension to the existing SSHHook tests to set the keepalive_interval parameter\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-02T16:39:53Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T19:00:38Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T17:57:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5020abc5edca7ccf21468dc8a1351cdc256ff0cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b762a3aa539d4cae26133872448224e4a2eb46fd","head":{"label":"RJKeevil:add-sshhook-keepalive","ref":"add-sshhook-keepalive","sha":"b762a3aa539d4cae26133872448224e4a2eb46fd","user":{"login":"RJKeevil","id":10771606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil","html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109291689,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkyOTE2ODk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"RJKeevil/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RJKeevil","id":10771606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil","html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RJKeevil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RJKeevil/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1774) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe creation of an `MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator` is handled in a way that templates cannot be really used in the `job_id` parameter because there is a function that does some cleansing removing the patterns needed for templating.\r\nMoreover, the `job_id` parameter must be unique as per the Google Cloud ML documentation and a customisation (for example, per day) gets complicated due to the cleansing function.\r\n\r\nThe PR simplifies the creation of such object, in a similar manner as `MLEngineTrainingOperator` and improves the cleansing support when using templates in the `job_id` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not add any new unit tests but adapts the available ones to the changes done in the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1665) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently when the scheduler gets a database error, the  scheduler errors out.  However, sometimes the database outage is a temporary network issue or a short lived outage that the server should try reconnect.  As part of this change, a new configuration entry is added allowing for specifying how to retry reconnecting to the database as well as us reconnect code for sqlalchemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: The code added is for database reconnect/retry.  It cannot be tested using unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-01T04:51:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-11T22:05:07Z","closed_at":"2018-04-29T06:31:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ddc65b51f83181ccfa48a2c9444a8c203a1d8d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e7dfd8081af40653964458e98a94d5e57ff90a7f","head":{"label":"vklogin:DBReconnect","ref":"DBReconnect","sha":"e7dfd8081af40653964458e98a94d5e57ff90a7f","user":{"login":"vklogin","id":9982032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODIwMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9982032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin","html_url":"https://github.com/vklogin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109086996,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkwODY5OTY=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"vklogin/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vklogin","id":9982032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODIwMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9982032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin","html_url":"https://github.com/vklogin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vklogin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vklogin/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1770](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1770/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1770] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1770\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe HiveOperator as it currently stands is not flexible enough to accept a hive file and operate on that. You need to read in the contents and pass it and if you do that you need to change the way hiveconfs are in your file to jinja templating.\r\nMany teams already have their existing sql/hql files and don't want to convert them to make them as portable and decoupled as possible.\r\nTo accomplish this all we need to do is add the option to pass a hql_file and hiveconfs to the HiveOperator. We change the code in the execute to throw an error if both a hql_file and an hql statement are passed. If just hql_file the simplest way without changing the code of the hive hook is to just read the content of the hql_file and set it to be the self.hql. The hiveconfs get passed directly to the run_cli method and we can combine them with the already passed in hiveconfs.\r\nIf we want to make it optional to pass in the context as hiveconfs we can add that too as related to AIRFLOW-788.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI've included some tests to show it all works how we expect.\r\n* Throw error if both hql and hql_file passed\r\n* Test to show hql_file and hiveconfs option can pass correctly and run operator\r\n* show mapred name set if none passed by default\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-387 (Dropped postgres connections)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adopts the `provide_session` helper in almost the entire\r\ncodebase. This ensures session are handled and closed consistently.\r\nIn particular, this ensures we don't forget to close and thus leak\r\ndatabase connections.\r\n\r\nAs an additional change, the `provide_session` helper has been extended\r\nto also rollback and close created connections under error conditions.\r\n\r\nAs an additional helper, this commit also introduces a contextmanager\r\nthat provides the same functionality as the `provide_session`\r\ndecorator. This is helpful in cases where the scope of a session should\r\nbe smaller than the entire method where it is being used.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring under existing test coverage. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1764\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] The web interface should not use the experimental api as the authentication options differ between the two. Additionally, rather than having an API call to get the last run data we can easily include it in the generated HMTL response. One less round-trip, less endpoints, and less time before the page has fully rendered.\r\n\r\n  This is based original off @NielsZeilemaker's PR for the same Jira issue (#2734)\r\n\r\n  I haven't entirely removed the experimental latest_runs endpoint, but it could potentially be removed now as nothing (core) is using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: Updated test_index in core tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1765\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Previously the experimental API was either wide-open only (allow any request) or secured behind Kerberos. This adds a third option of deny-all.\r\n\r\n**For an alternative** approach that makes the API deny-by-default see #2736\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason: simple change, already marginally covered by existing flows.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-31T12:31:52Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T14:41:34Z","closed_at":"2017-11-01T14:39:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0620571afa16bfa9aed34bc5d63354c8c5b9425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4b683d217665943899fdddfe6cd2febef0ffa192","head":{"label":"ashb:exp-api-securable","ref":"exp-api-securable","sha":"4b683d217665943899fdddfe6cd2febef0ffa192","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1765\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Change the authentication backend on the experimental API backend to deny all requests by default. To restore the old behaviour a new \"allow_all\" backend has been introduced.\r\n\r\n**For an alternative** approach that leaves the default un-altered and simply adds an optional deny_all backend see #2737\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-31T12:31:33Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T14:41:26Z","closed_at":"2017-11-01T14:41:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc2e1f12939ec89fea9550d36148f7ae8d8f7466","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2bdfa052d7dcf91e635f8b47e4caf8bfe9f83204","head":{"label":"ashb:exp-api-deny-by-default","ref":"exp-api-deny-by-default","sha":"2bdfa052d7dcf91e635f8b47e4caf8bfe9f83204","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1764\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI've copies the latest dag runs api call to the web uit, because the web ui should use the experimental api internally. The authentication methods differ, and hence, we cannot link them without breaking some authentication methods.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-30T11:07:42Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T08:46:15Z","closed_at":"2017-11-01T08:46:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63d590cc404486dd0f21f07a28a5fd614833dcea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/524d55d21bc3af1753fce95c2451652cf0225fc6","head":{"label":"NielsZeilemaker:move_api_calls","ref":"move_api_calls","sha":"524d55d21bc3af1753fce95c2451652cf0225fc6","user":{"login":"NielsZeilemaker","id":3777585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker","html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89462053,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTQ2MjA1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"NielsZeilemaker/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NielsZeilemaker","id":3777585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker","html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NielsZeilemaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NielsZeilemaker/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCertain schemas for group membership return a string\r\ninstead of a list. Instead of using a check we now\r\nuse the entries API from ldap3.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new tests as they are schema dependent, relying on ldap3 API specification.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@brokenjacobs @criccomini \r\n\r\n@criccomini we should eventually rework the ldap integration to use the \"entries\" API from ldap3 which is

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1737\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen trying to set the state of a task created by manually triggered DAGs, an exception was thrown: \r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: unconverted data remains: ..372649\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening because `TaskInstanceModelView` was not expecting to parse **execution dates** containing some fractional number (which usually happens for manually triggered DAGs).\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a check for a fractional number and, if it is found, uses an alternative format string.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests.www.test_views:TestTaskInstanceStateView\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-800\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x ] airflow initdb creates a connection with conn_id='bigquery_default' and conn_type='bigquery'. However, bigquery is not a valid conn_type, according to models.Connection._types, and BigQuery connections should use the google_cloud_platform conn_type. This commit changes the default bigquery connection type in the airflow.utils.db.initdb() and tests.core.CliTests.test_cli_connections_list() \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests tests.core.CliTests.test_cli_connections_list() \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-25T12:05:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T16:50:07Z","closed_at":"2017-10-25T14:45:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7be476a48de606b1a60f0f82145b23a6482c3e4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c05b2cf5d3edb7bf0cf5318d1c8e51dc30b96a26","head":{"label":"88sanjay:master","ref":"master","sha":"c05b2cf5d3edb7bf0cf5318d1c8e51dc30b96a26","user":{"login":"88sanjay","id":9412614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTI2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9412614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/88sanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108262488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgyNjI0ODg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"88sanjay/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"88sanjay","id":9412614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTI2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9412614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/88sanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/88sanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/88sanjay/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1755\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI would like to submit this change that allows Airflow to support accessing easily the web UI from an endpoint such as `/airflow` and Flower with `/flower`.\r\n\r\nFor Flower, it is already possible to use the `flowerconfig.py` to convey the `url_prefix` setting, but I prefered aligning it\r\n\r\nI propose this change that add 2 new settings on `airflow.cfg` and the CLI arguments:\r\n```\r\n# Root URL to use for the web server\r\nweb_server_url_prefix = /airflow\r\n...\r\n# The root URL for Flower\r\nflower_url_prefix = /flower\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion on how to add unit tests on this PR. Tests will be done on a preproduction cluster running Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-24T22:38:11Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T16:31:29Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T12:42:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8361f456f6587b1f3c7ac45bb7a11f30bbd00f76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/32a7e58bd4fa1892deefb2c7a0248e7d07d04df1","head":{"label":"gsemet:url_prefix","ref":"url_prefix","sha":"32a7e58bd4fa1892deefb2c7a0248e7d07d04df1","user":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86827902,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjgyNzkwMg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"gsemet/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache
