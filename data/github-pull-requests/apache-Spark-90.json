### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously, #34829 was raised which was auto closed due to staleness. This is a rework of that by addressing comments raised.\r\n\r\n This PR seeks to improve the performance of serving the application list in History Server by storing the required information of the application as part of HDFS extended attributes instead of parsing the log file each time.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n Improves the performance of the History Server listing page\r\n\r\nBelow is the comparison of the  time taken to complete `mergeApplicationListing` call [in FsHistoryProvider](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L584) that is called for every log file that is updated in the event log directory : \r\n\r\n| Event log size  | Extended Attributes disabled (in ms) | Extended Attributes enabled (in ms) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 122MB  | 1340 | 137  |\r\n| 10.2MB  | 866 | 135  |\r\n| 5.5MB  | 645  | 136 |\r\n|  0.6MB | 505 | 134 |\r\n| 0.8MB  | 525 | 137  |\r\n\r\nAs we can see in the comparison above, irrespective of the event log size, the time to build the application listing for the app remains the same. This is hugely beneficial in clusters that have very large event log sizes.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n No.\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\n Will add unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe timeout duration for the REPL has been increased from 10 -> 30 seconds (to address slow start on JDK 17 tests) and the semaphore permits are drained after each test (to avoid cascading failures, [context](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40675#discussion_r1174917132)). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe GA JDK 17 tests consistently fails as described in the [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43285).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLocally verified by installing and running tests with JDK 17 (both the failure and the subsequent

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis fixes couple of important issues related to session management for streaming queries.\r\n\r\n1. Session mapping should be maintained at connect server as long as the streaming query is active, even if there are no accesses from the client side. Currently the session mapping is dropped after 1 hour of inactivity. \r\n2. When streaming query is stopped, the Spark session drops its reference to the streaming query object. That implies it can not accessed by remote spark-connect client. It is common usage pattern for users to access a streaming query after it is is stopped (e.g. to check its metrics, any exception if failed, etc). \r\n   - This is not a problem in legacy mode since the user code in the REPL keeps the reference. This is no longer the case in Spark-Connect. \r\n\r\n*Solution*: This PR adds `SparkConnectStreamingQueryCache` that does the following:\r\n  * Each new streaming query is registered with this cache.\r\n  * It runs a periodic task that checks the status of these queries and polls session mapping in connect-server so that the session stays alive.\r\n  * When query is stopped, it cached for 1 hour more so the it can be accessed from remote client. \r\n  * The full semantics are codified in the scaladoc. See [this comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40937/files#r1176846545) for more details.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n  - Explained in the above description.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit tests\r\n- Manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade FasterXML jackson from 2.14.2 to 2.15.0\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpgrade Snakeyaml to 2.0 (resolves CVE-2022-1471 [CVE-2022-1471 at nist](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR introduces user-facing changes by implementing streaming read constraints in the JSONOptions class. The constraints limit the size of input constructs, improving security and efficiency when processing input data.\r\n\r\nUsers working with JSON data larger than the following default settings may need to adjust the constraints accordingly:\r\n\r\nMaximum Number value length: 1000 characters (`DEFAULT_MAX_NUM_LEN`)\r\nMaximum String value length: 5,000,000 characters (`DEFAULT_MAX_STRING_LEN`)\r\nMaximum Nesting depth: 1000 levels (`DEFAULT_MAX_DEPTH`)\r\nAdditionally, the maximum magnitude of scale for BigDecimal to BigInteger conversion is set to 100,000 digits (`MAX_BIGINT_SCALE_MAGNITUDE`) and cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nUsers can customize the constraints as needed by providing the corresponding options in the parameters object. If not explicitly specified, default settings will be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

This patch fixed the OutOfMemory exception.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-24T14:24:01Z","updated_at":"2023-08-05T00:19:56Z","closed_at":"2023-08-05T00:19:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"918d10611ddb21ca6fe23dac4d94e946fd98c02c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5fbb4166577f7062079c6fe0f2f2b2cbfd8943c7","head":{"label":"majdyz:colvec-memory-optimize","ref":"colvec-memory-optimize","sha":"5fbb4166577f7062079c6fe0f2f2b2cbfd8943c7","user":{"login":"majdyz","id":76959103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTU5MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76959103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz","html_url":"https://github.com/majdyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":631986436,"node_id":"R_kgDOJatZBA","name":"spark","full_name":"majdyz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"majdyz","id":76959103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTU5MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76959103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz","html_url":"https://github.com/majdyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majdyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/majdyz/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40699 to avoid changing the Cast behavior. It pulls out the cast-to-string code into a base trait, and add a new Expression `ToPrettyString` to extend this trait with a little customization.\r\n\r\nIt also handles binary value inside array/struct/map to also print hex format, for `df.show` only, not `Cast`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3.

It was `null`, then changed to `NULL` in #40699 , and is `null` again after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR extends `ResolveRowLevelCommandAssignments` to also cover MERGE assignments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-42151, these changes are needed so that we can rewrite MERGE statements into executable plans for tables that support row-level operations. In particular, our row-level mutation framework assumes Spark is responsible for building an updated version of each affected row and that row is passed back to the data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port of #40766 and #40881.\r\n\r\nIn `JoinCodegenSupport#getJoinCondition`, evaluate any referenced stream-side variables before using them in the generated code.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't evaluate the passed stream-side variables directly, but instead evaluates a copy (`streamVars2`). This is because `SortMergeJoin#codegenFullOuter` will want to evaluate the stream-side vars within a different scope than the condition check, so we mustn't delete the initialization code from the original `ExprCode` instances.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen a bound condition of a full outer join references the same stream-side column more than once, wholestage codegen generates bad code.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following query fails with a compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1 as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(1, 1),\r\n(2, 2),\r\n(3, 1)\r\nas v1(key, value);\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view v2 as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(1, 22, 22),\r\n(3, -1, -1),\r\n(7, null, null)\r\nas v2(a, b, c);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom v1\r\nfull outer join v2\r\non key = a\r\nand value > b\r\nand value > c;\r\n```\r\nThe error is:\r\n```\r\norg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 277, Column 9: Redefinition of local variable \"smj_isNull_7\"\r\n```\r\nThe same error occurs with code generated from ShuffleHashJoinExec:\r\n```\r\nselect /*+ SHUFFLE_HASH(v2) */ *\r\nfrom v1\r\nfull outer join v2\r\non key = a\r\nand value > b\r\nand value > c;\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the error is:\r\n```\r\norg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 174, Column 5: Redefinition of local variable \"shj_value_1\"\r\n```\r\nNeither `SortMergeJoin#codegenFullOuter` nor `ShuffledHashJoinExec#doProduce` evaluate the stream-side variables before calling `consumeFullOuterJoinRow#getJoinCondition`. As a result, `getJoinCondition` generates definition/initialization code for each referenced stream-side variable at the point of use. If a stream-side variable is used more than once in the bound condition, the definition/initialization code is generated more than once, resulting in the \"Redefinition of local variable\" error.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the query succeeds, since Spark disables wholestage codegen and tries again.\r\n\r\n(In the case other join-type/strategy pairs, either the implementations don't call `JoinCodegenSupport#getJoinCondition`, or the stream-side variables are pre-evaluated before the call is made, so no error happens in those cases).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `ObjectHashAggregateExec` has three preformance issues:\r\n- heavy overhead of scala sugar in `createNewAggregationBuffer`\r\n- unnecessary grouping key comparation after fallback to sort based aggregator\r\n- the aggregation buffer in sort based aggregator is not reused for all rest rows\r\n\r\nThen the performance is poor with high cardinality grouping keys.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove performance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe test should be covered by `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.SortBasedAggregationStoreSuite`\r\n\r\nAdd benchmark for high cardinality case.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport only decommission idle workers in standalone\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, standalone master web ui supports kill/decommission workers. But when graceful decommission is enabled, running task, shuffle and rdd migration could take long time. While waiting for running task, shuffle and rdd migration, decommissioned workers can't run new executors and decommissioned executors can't run new tasks. This caused lot of resource waste.\r\n\r\nIf only idle workers to be decommissioned, these workers could be shutdown and removed to save cost without waiting long decommissioning process.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nPOST http://masterWebUI:port/workers/kill/idleOnly=true\r\nDefault: false\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollowing describes the changes made, all changes are behind respective configuration properties\r\n\r\n1. Followed the same model as driver to create svc records for executors as well. The lifecycle of the SVC record is tied to executor lifecycle. While registering with drivers, executors now supply their SVC hostname. **Controlled by a new configuration (added as part of this PR): `spark.kubernetes.executor.service`**\r\n    \r\n![exec_service](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3784871/233761856-f135c726-9c90-4a44-bcac-84ce97f09b9d.png)\r\n    \r\n2. Allowed drivers and executors to bind to all IPs. **Controlled by existing properties `spark.driver.bindAddress` and `spark.executor.bindAddress`. This PR makes `0.0.0.0` a permissible value**\r\n    \r\n![bind_address](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3784871/233761913-f763a0f0-bccf-4743-871c-f982b93cf7ba.png)\r\n    \r\n3. Added support for providing\r\n    1. pre start script: that would be run before driver/executor JVM gets started. This script can do any setup e.g. waiting for istio-proxy sidecar to be up.\r\n    2. post stop script: that would be run after driver/executor JVM completes. This script can do any cleanup example in our case it makes a REST call to shutdown sidecar.These scripts are not part of the PR because the onus of providing any specialized cleanup would lie with the client. In our case it is provided by Proton. **Controlled by new configurations (added as part of this PR): `spark.kubernetes.post.stop.script`, `spark.kubernetes.pre.start.script` which when set will be executed before and after the driver/executor JVM**\r\n\r\n![sidecar_termination](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3784871/233762111-9251aa14-87a7-4339-8549-45b4ae1e06dc.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark allows using Kubernetes as the resource scheduler however off the shelf does not work with Kubernetes cluster using Istio service mesh in strict MTLS mode because:\r\n\r\n1. For Istio to work, it needs to know the network identity of all possible network paths. Currently network identity (through a K8s service record) is created only for the driver pod but not for executors.\r\n2. Istio adds a istio-proxy sidecar to every pod and this sidecar handles all pod to pod networking. However the sidecar binds to Pod IP and then sends ingress traffic to localhost (if PILOT_ENABLE_INBOUND_PASSTHROUGH is set to false). Therefore for ingress traffic to correctly reach application processes (like driver and executor JVMs), the processes need to bind to all IPs and not just Pod IP, as otherwise, traffic routed to localhost by the sidecar would not reach the application processes. Off the shelf Spark allows driver and executors to only bind to Pod IP and therefore does not work with Istio.\r\n3. Unlike the Istio sidecar, driver/executor containers in the pod can finish. In which case a pod would enter NotReady state (as driver/executor containers can complete) while sidecar would continue to run. Therefore once the driver/executor containers are done, they need to signal to the istio sidecar as well to terminate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce *any* user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds configs that can be used to run on an K8s cluster using Istio service mesh, with strict MTLS.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added new unit tests\r\n- Tested on a strict MTLS Istio Kubernetes cluster.","created_at":"2023-04-22T04:33:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T00:19:47Z","closed_at":"2023-12-18T00:19:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e80ac5ef19b5b410e3ce9fd2035346ab4b0267f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72abbc602f4f1bf635e5c75e54180026a376b129","head":{"label":"puneetguptanitj:SPARK-42411-add-support-for-istio-with-strict-mtls","ref":"SPARK-42411-add-support-for-istio-with-strict-mtls","sha":"72abbc602f4f1bf635e5c75e54180026a376b129","user":{"login":"puneetguptanitj","id":3784871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3784871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetguptanitj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":238334605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzgzMzQ2MDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"puneetguptanitj/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"puneetguptanitj","id":3784871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3784871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj","html_url":"https://github.com/puneetguptanitj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puneetguptanitj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/puneetguptanitj/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn some use cases, users have incoming dataframes with fixed column names which might differ from the canonical order. Currently there's no way to handle this easily through the INSERT INTO API - the user has to make sure the columns are in the right order as they would when inserting a tuple. We should add an optional BY NAME clause, such that:\r\n\r\n`INSERT INTO tgt BY NAME <query>`\r\n\r\ntakes each column of <query> and inserts it into the column in `tgt` which has the same name according to the configured `resolver` logic.\r\n\r\nSome definitions need to be clarified: \r\n1. `BY NAME` and specified column insertion (`INSERT INTO t1 (a,b)`... ) is a mutually exclusive operation\r\n2. But it supports to define partition while using `BY NAME`: `INSERT INTO t PARTITION(a=1) BY NAME <query>` \r\n\r\nAt now don't support `INSERT OVERWRITE BY NAME` (I will supported in follow up)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  3. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  4. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  5. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd new feature `INSERT INTO BY NAME`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nOverride the parent `__dir__()` method on Python `DataFrame` class to include column names. Main benefit of this is that any autocomplete engine that uses `dir()` to generate autocomplete suggestions (e.g. IPython kernel, Databricks Notebooks) will suggest column names on the completion `df.|`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo keep `__dir__()` consistent with `__getattr__()`. So this is arguably a bug fix. Increases productivity for anyone who uses an autocomplete engine on pyspark code.\r\n\r\nExample of column attribute completion coming for free after this change:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84545946/233747057-56b2589d-d075-4d13-8349-ac5142c38c62.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWill change the output of `dir(df)`. If the user chooses to use the private method `df.__dir__()`, they will also notice an output and docstring difference there.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew doctest with three assertions. Output where I only ran this test:\r\n![pyspark test passed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84545946/233744674-b59191a7-08bf-4f3e-a491-945e687727b0.png)\r\n\r\nTo test it in a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe add a logging when creating the batch reader with task ID, topic, partition and offset range included.\r\nThe log line looks like

finding which task handling which topic/partition and offset range. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun KafkaMicroBatchV2SourceSuite and watch logging outputs contain information needed. Also does a small cluster test and observe logs.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-21T21:38:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T00:37:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T00:33:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d785947d8a89f5f82cf1c2ac0ddd90341001994","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

This is intended for generating keys based on passwords and OpenSSL's documents discourage its use: \"Newer applications should use a more modern algorithm\".\r\n\r\n`aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` should use the key directly in CBC mode, as it does for both GCM and ECB mode. The output should then be the initialization vector (IV) prepended to the ciphertext – as is done with GCM mode:\r\n`[16-byte randomly generated IV | AES-CBC encrypted ciphertext]`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe want to have the ciphertext output similar across different modes. OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey is effectively deprecated and their own documentation says not to use it. Instead, CBC mode will generate a random vector.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAES-CBC output generated by the previous format will be incompatible with this change. That change was recently landed and we want to land this before CBC mode is used in practice.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test in `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` was added to test both GCM and CBC modes. Also, a new standalone unit test suite was added in `ExpressionImplUtilsSuite` to test all the modes and various key lengths.\r\n\r\nCBC values can be verified with `openssl enc` using the following command:\r\n```\r\necho -n \"[INPUT]\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv [HEX IV] -K [HEX KEY]\r\necho -n \"Spark\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv f8c832cc9c61bac6151960a58e4edf86 -K

#40794. #40794 tried to more safely create `AttributeReference` objects from multi-part attributes in `ImplicitAttribute`. But that broke things and we had to revert. This PR is limiting the fix to the `UnresolvedAttribute` object returned by `DslAttr.attr`, which is enough to fix the issue here.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes DSL expressions on attributes with special characters by making `DslAttr.attr` and `DslAttr.expr` return the implicitly wrapped attribute instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43142: DSL expressions on attributes with special characters don't work even if the attribute names are quoted:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAttribute = 'slashed/col\r\n\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr.asc\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nmismatched input '/' expecting {<EOF>, '.', '-'}(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nslashed/col\r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nDSL expressions rely on a call to `expr` to get child of the new expression [(e.g.)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L149).\r\n\r\n`expr` here is a call on implicit class `DslAttr` that's wrapping the `UnresolvedAttribute` returned by `\"...\".attr` is wrapped by the implicit class `DslAttr`.\r\n\r\n`DslAttr` and its super class implement `DslAttr.expr` such that a new `UnresolvedAttribute` is created from `UnresolvedAttribute.name` of the wrapped attribute [(here)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L273-L280).\r\n\r\nBut `UnresolvedAttribute.name` drops the quotes and thus the newly created `UnresolvedAttribute` parses an identifier that should be quoted but isn't:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> \"`col/slash`\".attr.name\r\nres5: String = col/slash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDSL expressions on attributes with special characters no longer fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI couldn't find a suite testing the implicit classes in the DSL package, but the DSL package seems used widely enough that I'm confident this doesn't break existing behavior.\r\n\r\nLocally, I was able to reproduce with this test; it was failing before and passes now:\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"chained DSL expressions on attributes with special characters\") {\r\n  $\"`slashed/col`\".asc\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2023-04-21T20:03:11Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T12:16:37Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T10:23:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58f29fa82df356b45d329e0ef2a6981aa38e5bc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b50a88645688d9a7cbb6f778f60afc5acd2fd0c","head":{"label":"rshkv:wr/spark-43142-v2","ref":"wr/spark-43142-v2","sha":"7b50a88645688d9a7cbb6f778f60afc5acd2fd0c","user":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":243588217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDM1ODgyMTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"rshkv/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `CoalesceBucketsInJoin.satisfiesOutputPartitioning` to support matching `PartitioningCollection`. A common case is that we add an alias on the join key.

t2.i AND t.t1j = t2.j\r\n```\r\nThe left side outputPartitioning is:\r\n```\r\n(hashpartitioning(t1i#41, t1j#42, 8) or hashpartitioning(i#46, t1j#42, 8) or hashpartitioning(t1i#41, j#47, 8) or hashpartitioning(i#46, j#47, 8))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEnhance `CoalesceBucketsInJoin` to support more cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts changes from [SPARK-42896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42896) and [SPARK-42929](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42929) which made `mapInPandas` and `mapInArrow` support barrier mode execution via adding a `is_barrier` parameter.\r\n\r\nInstead, this PR add `is_barrier` as a optional function attribute, so that the barrier python UDF can be supported in physical operators other than `MapInBatchExec`.\r\n\r\nRight now I want to narrow its usage scope because it is only used in ML:\r\n\r\n- only supported in Pandas UDF;\r\n- only supported in `MapInPandas` and `MapInArrow`;\r\n- can not be registered;\r\n\r\nThis PR will not add a user-facing API or Parameter or Annotation, instead only a _private_ function attribute will be added, that is because:\r\n\r\n- Right now it is only needed to integrate external ML training frameworks like PyTorch and XGBoost, which just run `collect` after the UDF execution to obtain the model coefficients;\r\n- The limitation of existing barrier mode: many RDD operations are not supported, see [1](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1a6b1770c85f37982b15d261abf9cc6e4be740f4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L474-L488) and

And it is non-trivial to make `RDDBarrier` fully compatible with `RDD`.\r\n \r\nA simple example to illustrate this problem:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 21), (2, 30)], (\"id\", \"age\"))\r\n\r\nIn [2]: def filter_func(iterator):\r\n   ...:     for pdf in iterator:\r\n   ...:         yield pdf[pdf.id == 1]\r\n   ...: \r\n\r\nIn [3]: df.mapInPandas(filter_func, df.schema).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nMapInPandas filter_func(id#0L, age#1L)#4, [id#5L, age#6L], false\r\n+- *(1) Scan ExistingRDD[id#0L,age#1L]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn [4]: df.mapInPandas(filter_func, df.schema).show()\r\n+---+---+                                                                       \r\n| id|age|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1| 21|\r\n+---+---+\r\n\r\n\r\nIn [5]: df.mapInPandas(filter_func, df.schema, barrier=True).explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nMapInPandas filter_func(id#0L, age#1L)#23, [id#24L, age#25L], true\r\n+- *(1) Scan ExistingRDD[id#0L,age#1L]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn [6]: df.mapInPandas(filter_func, df.schema, barrier=True).show()\r\n23/04/26 15:39:57 WARN DAGScheduler: Creating new stage failed due to exception - job: 3\r\norg.apache.spark.scheduler.BarrierJobUnsupportedRDDChainException: [SPARK-24820][SPARK-24821]: Barrier execution mode does not allow the following pattern of RDD chain within a barrier stage:\r\n1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the ammonite REPL use the `CodeClassWrapper` mode for classfile generation (make ammonite generate classes instead of objects) and changes the UDF serialization from lazy to eager.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes have the following impact:\r\n- `CodeClassWrapper` change\r\n  - Fixes the `io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNKNOWN: ammonite/repl/ReplBridge$` error when trying to use the `filter` method (see [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43198) for reproduction)\r\n- Lazy to eager UDF serialization\r\n  - With class-based generation, UDFs defined using `def` would hit CNFE because the `ScalarUserDefinedFuntion` class gets captured during serialisation and sent over to the server (the class is a client-only class).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behaviour and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behaviour difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. There are two significant changes:\r\n\r\n- Filter works as expected when using \"in-place\" lambda expressions such as in `spark.range(10).filter(n => n % 2 == 0).collectAsList()`\r\n- UDFs defined using a lambda expression which is stored in a `val` fail due to deserialisation issues on the server.\r\n  - Root cause is currently unknown but a ticket has been [filed](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43227) to address the issue.\r\n  - Example: see [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...vicennial:spark:SPARK-43198?expand=1#diff-8d8a214eff5d2c8d523b59f2a39758ddfa84912ef7d4e0276f54e979a58f88e0R120-R129) test.\r\n  - Currently, it is a compromise to get `filter` working as expected since that bug is a higher-impact due to it impacting the \"general\" way of using the method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew unit

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\nI also changed `ProtoToParsedPlanTestSuite` a little to remove the memory addresses, before the change the test for streaming table would fail with:\r\n```\r\n- streaming_table_API_with_options *** FAILED *** (8 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   Expected and actual plans do not match:\r\n[info]   \r\n[info]   === Expected Plan ===\r\n[info]   SubqueryAlias primary.tempdb.myStreamingTable\r\n[info]   +- StreamingRelationV2 primary.tempdb.myStreamingTable, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.InMemoryTable@752725d9, [p1=v1, p2=v2], [id#0L], org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.InMemoryCatalog@347d8e2a, tempdb.myStreamingTable\r\n[info]   \r\n[info]   \r\n[info]   === Actual Plan ===\r\n[info]   SubqueryAlias primary.tempdb.myStreamingTable\r\n[info]   +- StreamingRelationV2 primary.tempdb.myStreamingTable, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.InMemoryTable@a88a5db, [p1=v1, p2=v2], [id#0L], org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.InMemoryCatalog@2c6b362e, tempdb.myStreamingTable\r\n```\r\nBecause the memory address (`InMemoryTable@752725d9`) is different every time it runs. I removed these in the test suite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd verified that memory addresses doesn't exist in existing explain files:\r\n```\r\nwei.liu:~/oss-spark$ cat

Add support for metadata extractors, so that we can express such columns in a generic way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllows to express the existing file-source metadata columns in a generic way (previously hard-wired), and also allows to lazily derive expensive metadata values only if the query actually selects them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. Plus, existing file-source metadata unit tests pass.","created_at":"2023-04-20T17:58:29Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T12:24:34Z","closed_at":"2023-04-25T08:11:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbabc89f824bbb15703782508f64b80b364dce8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/038bb1cb6a7b46a329646adac6dd8211eb9a6ee7","head":{"label":"ryan-johnson-databricks:file-constant-metadata-extractors","ref":"file-constant-metadata-extractors","sha":"038bb1cb6a7b46a329646adac6dd8211eb9a6ee7","user":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":523479704,"node_id":"R_kgDOHzOqmA","name":"spark","full_name":"ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe want to allow the parameterization of identifiers in SQL statements without compromising security.\r\nRight now this can only be done using ${..}  variable substitution which allows for arbitrary text substitution.\r\nThe improvement proposed here is to use an IDENTIFIER(<stringliteral>) clause which produces a possibly qualified identifier. That way any text substitution from a client or using ${..} can be safely scoped.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSET hivevar:tab = 'mytab';\r\nSELECT * FROM IDENTIFIER(${hivevar:tab});\r\n==>\r\nSELECT * FROM mytab;\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the IDENTIFIER(<literal) syntax originates from Snowflake.\r\nThere is no other vendor I am aware of with similar capability.\r\n\r\n[Link to a more detailed specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14BhSZFeDoK-iZa7-66PjlHQ4nYLpdePDWNSW3kkLZAs/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo protect scripts that substitute table or column names from SQL injection attacks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this is a new SQL feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36625 and its followup https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38321 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExternal table location can be arbitrary and has no connection with the database location. It can be wrong to qualify the external table location based on the database location.\r\n\r\nIf a table written by old Spark versions does not have a qualified location, there is no way to restore it as the information is already lost. People can manually fix the table locations assuming they are under the same HDFS cluster with the database location, by themselves.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExample query:\r\n```sql\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view t0 (a, b)\r\nas values\r\n    (1, 1.0),\r\n    (2, 2.0);\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1 (c, d)\r\nas values\r\n    (2, 3.0); \r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"select *, (select (count(1)) is null from t1 where t0.a = t1.c) from t0\").collect()\r\nres6: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([1,1.0,null], [2,2.0,false])  \r\n```\r\nIn this subquery, count(1) always evaluates to a non-null integer value, so count(1) is null is always false. The correct evaluation of the subquery is always false.\r\n\r\nWe incorrectly evaluate it to null for empty groups. The reason is that NullPropagation rewrites `Aggregate [c] [isnull(count(1))]` to `Aggregate [c] [false]`, this rewrite would be correct normally, but in the context of a scalar subquery it breaks our count bug handling in RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery.constructLeftJoins . By the time we get there, the query appears to not have the count bug - it looks the same as if the original query had a subquery with `select any_value(false) from r...`, and that case is not subject to the count bug.\r\n\r\nPostgres comparison show correct always-false result: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/67822/5\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe reason are `NullPropagation` triggers the bug for `(count(1)) is null`, but the root cause is the wrong handling of literals when dealing with the count bug. The bug can be triggered when the scalar subquery has a global aggregate with a constant, which can be produced by NullPropagation or by the user query directly. We should make sure `resultWithZeroTups` return real value when use scalar subquery and return value are `Literal`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nReplace reflection w/ direct calling for YARN Resource API, including \r\n\r\n- `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.ResourceInformation`, \r\n- `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException`\r\n\r\nwhich were added in [YARN-4081](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4081) (Hadoop 2.10.0/3.0.0) \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify code. Since [SPARK-42452](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42452) removed support for Hadoop 2, we can call those API directly now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request to port the fix from the master branch to version 3.3. [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40755)\r\n\r\nWhen doing an outer join with joinWith on DataFrames, unmatched rows return Row objects with null fields instead of a single null value. This is not a expected behavior, and it's a regression introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/cd92f25be5a221e0d4618925f7bc9dfd3bb8cb59). This pull request aims to fix the regression, note this is not a full rollback of the commit, do not add back \"schema\" variable.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class ClassData(a: String, b: Int)\r\nval left = Seq(ClassData(\"a\", 1), ClassData(\"b\", 2)).toDF\r\nval right = Seq(ClassData(\"x\", 2), ClassData(\"y\", 3)).toDF\r\n\r\nleft.joinWith(right, left(\"b\") === right(\"b\"), \"left_outer\").collect\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWrong results (current behavior):    Array(([a,1],[null,null]), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\nCorrect results:                     Array(([a,1],null), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to address the regression mentioned above. It results in unexpected behavior changes in the Dataframe joinWith API between versions 2.4.8 and 3.0.0+. This could potentially cause data correctness issues for users who expect the old behavior when using Spark 3.0.0+.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test (use the same test in previous [closed pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35140), credit to Clément de Groc) Run sql-core and sql-catalyst submodules locally with ./build/mvn clean package -pl sql/core,sql/catalyst\r\n\r\nCloses #40755 from kings129/encoder_bug_fix.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: --global

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current validation on charset is restrictive. It does not allow\r\nblank space and digits. It's common for user agent strings to contain\r\nthese characters.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it restricts the length to stay under 200 characters.\r\nThe limit to 200 characters was mostly something that was done as a\r\nsimple protection mechanism. We've looked into different specifications\r\nfor what could be part of the user agent and longer user agents are\r\ncommon. Increase this restriction to 2KB.\r\nThe server should enforce restrictions on its side, but we would still like\r\nto keep the restriction as fallback protection, but allow large values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit
