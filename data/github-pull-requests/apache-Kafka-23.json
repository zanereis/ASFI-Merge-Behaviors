change implements the AddVoter RPC. The high-level algorithm is as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Check that the leader has fenced the previous leader(s) by checking that the HWM is known, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n2. Check that the cluster supports kraft.version 1, otherwise return the UNSUPPORTED_VERSION error.\r\n3. Check that there are no uncommitted voter changes, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n4. Check that the new voter's id is not part of the existing voter set, otherwise return the DUPLICATE_VOTER error.\r\n5. Send an API_VERSIONS RPC to the first (default) listener to discover the supported kraft.version of the new voter.\r\n6. Check that the new voter supports the current kraft.version, otherwise return the INVALID_REQUEST error.\r\n7. Check that the new voter is caught up to the log end offset of the leader, otherwise return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n8. Append the updated VotersRecord to the log.\r\nThe KRaft internal listener will read this uncommitted record from the log and add the new voter to the set of voters.\r\n9. Wait for the VotersRecord to commit using the majority of the new set of voters. Return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error if it doesn't commit in time.\r\n10. Send the AddVoter successful response to the client.\r\n\r\nThe leader implements the above algorithm by tracking 3 events: the ADD_VOTER request is received, the API_VERSIONS response is received and finally the HWM is updated.\r\n\r\nThe state of the ADD_VOTER operation is tracked by LeaderState using the AddVoterHandlerState. The algorithm is implemented by the AddVoterHandler type.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a small issue introduced by the bootstrap checkpoint (0-0.checkpoint). The internal partition listener (KRaftControlRecordStateMachine) and the external partition listener (KafkaRaftClient.ListenerContext) were using \"nextOffset = 0\" as the initial state of the reading cursor. This was causing the bootstrap checkpoint to keep getting reloaded until the leader wrote a record to the log. Changing the initial offset (nextOffset) to -1 allows the listeners to distinguish between the initial state (nextOffset == -1) and the bootstrap checkpoint was loaded but the log segment is empty (nextOffset == 0).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

change implements the AddVoter RPC. The high-level algorithm is as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Check that the leader has fenced the previous leader(s) by checking that the HWM is known, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n2. Check that the cluster supports kraft.version 1, otherwise return the UNSUPPORTED_VERSION error.\r\n3. Check that there are no uncommitted voter changes, otherwise return the REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n4. Check that the new voter's id is not part of the existing voter set, otherwise return the DUPLICATE_VOTER error.\r\n5. Send an API_VERSIONS RPC to the first (default) listener to discover the supported kraft.version of the new voter.\r\n6. Check that the new voter supports the current kraft.version, otherwise return the INVALID_REQUEST error.\r\n7. Check that the new voter is caught up to the log end offset of the leader, otherwise return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error.\r\n8. Append the updated VotersRecord to the log.\r\nThe KRaft internal listener will read this uncommitted record from the log and add the new voter to the set of voters.\r\n9. Wait for the VotersRecord to commit using the majority of the new set of voters. Return a REQUEST_TIMED_OUT error if it doesn't commit in time.\r\n10. Send the AddVoter successful response to the client.\r\n\r\nThe leader implements the above algorithm by tracking 3 events: the ADD_VOTER request is received, the API_VERSIONS response is received and finally the HWM is updated.\r\n\r\nThe state of the ADD_VOTER operation is tracked by LeaderState using the AddVoterHandlerState. The algorithm is implemented by the AddVoterHandler type.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a small issue introduced by the bootstrap checkpoint (0-0.checkpoint). The internal partition listener (KRaftControlRecordStateMachine) and the external partition listener (KafkaRaftClient.ListenerContext) were using \"nextOffset = 0\" as the initial state of the reading cursor. This was causing the bootstrap checkpoint to keep getting reloaded until the leader wrote a record to the log. Changing the initial offset (nextOffset) to -1 allows the listeners to distinguish between the initial state (nextOffset == -1) and the bootstrap checkpoint was loaded but the log segment is empty (nextOffset == 0).","created_at":"2024-07-16T19:18:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T15:41:57Z","closed_at":"2024-07-18T15:41:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c58695f29bbe6fb28841a793d0a0676fc68493e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

is the part-2 of the [KIP-1075](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1075%3A+Introduce+delayed+remote+list+offsets+purgatory+to+make+LIST_OFFSETS+async)\r\n\r\nTo find the offset for a given timestamp, ListOffsets API is used by the client. When the topic is enabled with remote storage, then we have to fetch the remote indexes such as offset-index and time-index to serve the query. Also, the ListOffsets request can contain the query for multiple topics/partitions.\r\n\r\nThe time taken to read the indexes from remote storage is non-deterministic and the query is handled by the request-handler threads. If there are multiple LIST_OFFSETS queries and most of the request-handler threads are busy in reading the data from remote storage, then the other high-priority requests such as FETCH and PRODUCE might starve and be queued. This can lead to higher latency in producing/consuming messages.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we have introduced a delayed operation for remote list-offsets call. If the timestamp need to be searched in the remote-storage, then the request-handler threads will pass-on the request to the remote-log-reader threads. And, the request gets handled in asynchronous fashion.\r\n\r\nCovered the patch with unit and integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

flaky failures for this test appear to be due to a race condition. The current test steps are:\r\n1. Produce 100 records to `test-topic-1`\r\n2. Start the MM2 connectors\r\n3. Wait for connector tasks to start (i.e., for there to be at least one task in the `RUNNING` state for each)\r\n4. Produce 100 more records to `test-topic-1`\r\n\r\nThe assumption is that the `MirrorSourceTask` instance will poll its consumer in between steps 3 and 4 and seek to the end offset of `test-topic-1`. However, it's possible that the task instance will have completed startup and be marked `RUNNING` by the Kafka Connect runtime, but that it has not been polled yet. If this takes place and the task is polled (or rather, the task first polls its consumer) after step 4, then it will ignore those records when it seeks to the end of the topic.\r\n\r\nAs a fix, we wait for the task to replicate data from a \"sentinel\" topic first, before producing an additional 100 records to `test-topic-1`. This guarantees that the task has been able to poll its consumer and seek to the end of `test-topic-1`, and allows us to verify that the task should replicate exactly 100 records for that topic.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

we have many test cases put `client.prepareResponseFrom(FindCoordinatorResponse.prepareResponse(...), ...);` after `newConsumer`. If `FutureResponse` is not in `MockClient`, the request can't get a response. This may cause some flaky tests.\r\n \r\nWhen starting a `newConsumer` for `AsyncKafkaConsumer`, it always sends `FindCoordinatorRequest`.\r\n \r\nIn `MockClient#send`, if a `FutureResponse` is missing, the request will be added to `requests`. Even if `client.prepareResponseFrom` adds a new `FutureResponse`, it can't be matched to an existent request, so the request can't get a response.\r\n \r\nIt's better to put `client.prepareResponseFrom(FindCoordinatorResponse.prepareResponse(...), ...);` before `newConsumer`, so we don't miss any `FindCoordinatorRequest`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

test case has become flaky since https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16477 was merged.\r\n\r\nFor a quick fix, we can give workers time to discover that the Kafka cluster has gone down in order for the health check endpoint to be accurate.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would not be necessary and we'd always detect that the Kafka cluster is down at the top of our tick loop [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0ada8fac6869cad8ac33a79032cf5d57bfa2a3ea/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L419). However, with some rare-but-not-impossible timing, that method may return without sending any requests to the group coordinator. This is itself probably indicative of a bug, and if reviewers agree, we can file a Jira ticket for it. But, because this possibly-buggy behavior is not newly-introduced and the cause of failure for our tests is simply a failure to account for that existing behavior in newly-introduced logic, we should not block on a fix for that behavior before modifying this test case to prevent flakiness.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-12T18:57:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-13T07:48:23Z","closed_at":"2024-07-13T07:48:19Z","merged_at":"2024-07-13T07:48:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"83081652abe3a7c836efe21cdfa52f2c0063953f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16585/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16585/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16585/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/34acd7ccfaf269c3d5490af70af6cf4e015e3c34","head":{"label":"C0urante:fix-connect-worker-integration-test","ref":"fix-connect-worker-integration-test","sha":"34acd7ccfaf269c3d5490af70af6cf4e015e3c34","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

when a connector config is read from the config topic, the name of the connector is added to the `DistributedHerder.connectorConfigUpdates` field. Then, if assigned that connector after the most recent rebalance, the worker (re)-starts that connector in `DistributedHerder::processConnectorConfigUpdates`. However, this is redundant if the connector has just been created. The worker will already have started that connector after being assigned it during rebalance in `DistributedHerder::handleRebalanceCompleted` and `DistributedHerder::startWork`.\r\n\r\nThis can cause duplicate task configurations to be written to the config topic, since the worker may have already written task configs for the connector after starting it the first time in `startWork`, but not have updated its config snapshot (tracked in the `DistributedHerder.configState` field) before restarting the connector in `processConnectorConfigUpdates`. If the restarted connector then generates task configs before the `configState` snapshot is updated, the herder will write a second set of identical task configs to the config topic.\r\n\r\nThis leads to flakiness in the `OffsetsApiIntegrationTest` suite for cases related to zombie sink tasks because the second set of task configs leads to the shutdown of all previously-running tasks for the sink connector, and because the connector is configured to block its tasks indefinitely in their `stop` method, the runtime never has a chance to close their consumers. In turn, this causes a hung rebalance when the second generation of sink tasks starts up and their consumers try to join the group for the first time, but the first generation of sink tasks have consumers that are still sending heartbeats, but not being polled.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that if [KAFKA-15826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15826) were addressed, the affected integration tests would not be flaky, and this would probably be a better overall fix for the health of Kafka Connect. However, it would also be more involved, and this fix does provide benefits outside of reducing test flakiness, so it still seems worth pursuing for now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

changes should fix the flakiness reported for `DumpLogSegmentsTest#testDumpRemoteLogMetadataNonZeroStartingOffset`.\r\nI was not able to reproduce locally, but the issue was that the second segment was not created in time:\r\n\r\n```sh    \r\nMissing required argument \"[files]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix consists of getting the log path directly from the rolled segment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe were also creating the log twice, and that was producing this warning:\r\n\r\n```sh    \r\n[2024-07-12 00:57:28,368] WARN [LocalLog partition=kafka-832386, dir=/tmp/kafka-2956913950351159820] Trying to

If a timeout occurs, the restored task is neither added to the task registry nor re-added to the state updater. The task is lost since it is not maintained anywhere.

to ensure that the consumer unsubscribe operation waits for a response to the leave group request before moving on to close the consumer. This makes it consistent with the behaviour of the legacy consumer.  \r\n\r\nThis will avoid undesired interactions on close, that triggers a leave group, and shuts down the network thread when it completes (which before this PR could led to responses to disconnected clients). \r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not change the transitions of the state machine on leave group, only the completion of the leave group future.

Problem:\r\nCurrently, `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` use `objectMapper.findAndRegisterModules()` to automatically discover and register Jackson modules. This approach attempts to register all modules that implement `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module`, which can lead to a `ServiceConfigurationError` when incompatible modules are present in the classpath.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, errors occur with messages like:\r\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module: <module-name> not a subtype`\r\n\r\nWhere <module-name> can be one of:\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.module.jaxb.JaxbAnnotationModule\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.guava.GuavaModule\r\n- com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.joda.JodaModule\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by explicitly registering the Afterburner module instead of using the broad `findAndRegisterModules()` method. This approach:\r\n\r\n1. Retains the performance benefits of the Afterburner module, as intended by PR #14992.\r\n2. Avoids errors caused by attempting to register incompatible Jackson modules.\r\n3. Provides more control over which modules are registered, reducing unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n## Implementation:\r\n- Remove `objectMapper.findAndRegisterModules()`\r\n- Add explicit registration of the Afterburner module\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that we maintain the desired performance improvements while eliminating errors related to incompatible Jackson library versions.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n- Used connector plugins previously causing ServiceConfigurationError\r\n- Verified that no ServiceConfigurationError is thrown during plugin discovery\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

test shouldRestoreSingleActiveStatefulTask() in DefaultStateUpdaterTest is flaky.\r\n\r\nThe flakiness comes from the fact that the state updater thread could call the first time `changelogReader.allChangelogsCompleted()` before it calls the first time `changelogReader.completedChangelogs()`. That happens, if `runOnce()` is run before the state updater thread reads a task from the input queue.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the flakiness, by making `changelogReader.allChangelogsCompleted()` depend on `changelogReader.completedChangelogs()`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

a active tasks are revoked they land as suspended tasks in the task registry. If they are then reassigned, the tasks are resumed and put into restoration. On assignment, we first handle the tasks in the task registry and then the tasks in the state updater. That means that if a task is re-assigned after a revocation, we remove the suspended task from the task registry, resume it, add it to the state updater, and then remove it from the list of tasks to create. After that we iterate over the tasks in the state updater and remove from there the tasks that are not in the list of tasks to create. However, now the state updater contains the resumed tasks that we removed from the task registry before but are no more in the list of tasks to create. In other words, we remove the resumed tasks from the state updater and close them although we just got them assigned.\r\n\r\nThis commit ensures that we first handle the tasks in the state updater and

After that we iterate over the tasks in the state updater and remove from there the tasks that are not in the list of tasks to create.

PR addresses an issue with the evictWhile method where a ConcurrentModificationException was being thrown due to modifications made to sortedMap during iteration. The following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- Safe Iteration: The method now iterates over a copied list of entries from sortedMap, ensuring that modifications to sortedMap do not interfere with the iteration process.\r\n- Consistent Removal: Entries are safely removed from sortedMap during the iteration without causing a ConcurrentModificationException\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-09T12:06:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T16:59:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b67d8ec2cde9406ccf84beb11c03f5c8bca787a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

PR addresses an issue with the evictWhile method where a ConcurrentModificationException was being thrown due to modifications made to sortedMap during iteration. The following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- Safe Iteration: The method now iterates over a copied list of entries from sortedMap, ensuring that modifications to sortedMap do not interfere with the iteration process.\r\n- Consistent Removal: Entries are safely removed from sortedMap during the iteration without causing a ConcurrentModificationException.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-09T10:13:58Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T12:31:30Z","closed_at":"2024-07-09T12:06:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a79e174475ab03597dd5bb4d18ad4482cf98a9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8dd95af363c3a822f1efd191c1a2b4175bbe6bbd","head":{"label":"ksolves:Kafka-16355","ref":"Kafka-16355","sha":"8dd95af363c3a822f1efd191c1a2b4175bbe6bbd","user":{"login":"ksolves","id":45265265,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ1MjY1MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45265265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves","html_url":"https://github.com/ksolves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":811773187,"node_id":"R_kgDOMGKtAw","name":"kafka","full_name":"ksolves/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ksolves","id":45265265,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ1MjY1MjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45265265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves","html_url":"https://github.com/ksolves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksolves/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ksolves/kafka","description":"Mirror
