start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T12:04:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T03:23:46Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T03:23:46Z","merged_at":"2021-10-11T03:23:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8629d89536f56bbebdbb56a404fb69e4a0a50b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53e7346d5486978592be386cbbf8a2b4fcd0e8ab","head":{"label":"shanuo0312:feature_long_header_handle_final","ref":"feature_long_header_handle_final","sha":"53e7346d5486978592be386cbbf8a2b4fcd0e8ab","user":{"login":"shanuo0312","id":3704135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDQxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3704135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312","html_url":"https://github.com/shanuo0312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shanuo0312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"914c3777bb4a8b6f7835dc6eb99d3f9dc17f459d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-13T15:19:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T15:20:13Z","closed_at":"2021-09-13T15:20:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c760c39b9c8b45e352d37f607c9b76a29785a41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a3c1ded7d6c0c340f2bae65da8d568570fd63b7b","head":{"label":"huangchenguang123:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"a3c1ded7d6c0c340f2bae65da8d568570fd63b7b","user":{"login":"huangchenguang123","id":37766284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzY2Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37766284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123","html_url":"https://github.com/huangchenguang123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangchenguang123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.6.x","ref":"2.6.x","sha":"6ea05b5a201d5f0bb67dc41a4bcc23d3e76cecda","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

find that there are several inefficient usages of Java Collections:\r\n\r\n1. The contains method is invoked upon a list object in a loop. We recommend replacing it with a HashSet.\r\n2. Random access can occur at several LinkedList objects, which run in linear time complexity. We recommend replacing them with Arraylist objects.\r\n3. There is no iteration occurring upon a LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet, thus the insertion order does not matter. We recommend replacing it with a HashMap and HashSet.\r\n4. ArrayList is inserted before an iteration, while multiple memory reallocation might occur when the size of the list exceeds its capacity. We recommend replacing it with a LinkedList.\r\n\r\nWe discovered the above inefficient usage of containers by our tool Ditto. The patch is submitted. Could you please check and accept it? We have tested the patch on our PC. The patched program works well.\r\n\r\nBests\r\n\r\nDitto","created_at":"2021-09-13T05:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T05:58:18Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T05:58:18Z","merged_at":"2021-09-14T05:58:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"914c3777bb4a8b6f7835dc6eb99d3f9dc17f459d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2bb3ba8bf6d9ce1490ac1b55bd6f7e679f37535e","head":{"label":"FastAtlas:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"2bb3ba8bf6d9ce1490ac1b55bd6f7e679f37535e","user":{"login":"FastAtlas","id":90056662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDU2NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90056662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas","html_url":"https://github.com/FastAtlas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403931134,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM5MzExMzQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"FastAtlas/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FastAtlas","id":90056662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDU2NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90056662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas","html_url":"https://github.com/FastAtlas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FastAtlas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FastAtlas/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-12T15:49:39Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T02:52:11Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T02:56:32Z","merged_at":"2021-09-18T02:56:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"082e632f512632074e6cab26f80089e8e8b03d01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a361db3110e38db66e98ba134db8445236242421","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-nacos-admin","ref":"fix-nacos-admin","sha":"a361db3110e38db66e98ba134db8445236242421","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to realize the conversion from Map<String, Object> to Map<String, String>, the implementation of AttachmentsAdapter is too complicated, and the inner class of the class is also used. For the sake of simplicity, the tool class MapUtils with less code is used to achieve the same function.\r\n\r\n为了实现Map<String, Object>到Map<String, String>的转换，AttachmentsAdapter实现的太复杂，还使用类内部类。为了简单起见，使用更少代码的工具类MapUtils来实现一样的功能。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-11T03:34:27Z","updated_at":"2024-12-08T06:10:22Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T04:40:39Z","merged_at":"2021-09-14T04:40:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8f6995b565250557eed548995ae1a6f12b8c1d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/43","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/43","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/43/labels","id":7059960,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n4","number":43,"title":"2.7.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":4,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:16:56Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T01:54:45Z","due_on":"2021-09-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T01:54:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/49a3b06f870e0944254510f74dcb3ef5bc98a7b5","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:rpccontext-opt","ref":"rpccontext-opt","sha":"49a3b06f870e0944254510f74dcb3ef5bc98a7b5","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/r

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to realize the conversion from Map<String, Object> to Map<String, String>, the implementation of AttachmentsAdapter is too complicated, and the inner class of the class is also used. For the sake of simplicity, the tool class MapUtils with less code is used to achieve the same function.\r\n\r\n为了实现Map<String, Object>到Map<String, String>的转换，AttachmentsAdapter实现的太复杂，还使用类内部类。为了简单起见，使用更少代码的工具类MapUtils来实现一样的功能。\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-11T03:30:58Z","updated_at":"2021-09-11T03:31:43Z","closed_at":"2021-09-11T03:31:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6af1d176f8103756229d7b8fd5da30cd113d2777","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:rpccontext-opt","ref":"rpccontext-opt","sha":"6af1d176f8103756229d7b8fd5da30cd113d2777","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-10T15:23:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T15:45:59Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T15:45:59Z","merged_at":"2021-09-21T15:45:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c854a8b6e3fa3302260c0a098413f06fe3f5004","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/359ce5d3dbedc3bc37cddfc5705ac65c5ff13550","head":{"label":"changfubai:issue-7656","ref":"issue-7656","sha":"359ce5d3dbedc3bc37cddfc5705ac65c5ff13550","user":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":396754276,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY3NTQyNzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"changfubai/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-10T10:01:20Z","updated_at":"2024-10-12T04:29:16Z","closed_at":"2021-09-11T15:40:09Z","merged_at":"2021-09-11T15:40:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bd54ae05492cc1a0ac8e6fcb3485cecc0c471e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/77e0084b4d7aac85b2af1c05b0c70e026583c381","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0910_refactor_cl","ref":"0910_refactor_cl","sha":"77e0084b4d7aac85b2af1c05b0c70e026583c381","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-10T06:14:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-12T12:10:32Z","closed_at":"2021-09-12T12:10:31Z","merged_at":"2021-09-12T12:10:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c60b8ee630ad430a9c27a48700303f5a1a31f31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/105fc06a237ebf9e83c90a06cfdafd17e15b51ef","head":{"label":"changfubai:issue-8741","ref":"issue-8741","sha":"105fc06a237ebf9e83c90a06cfdafd17e15b51ef","user":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":396754276,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY3NTQyNzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"changfubai/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSlightly reduce the UT time in `dubbo-config-spring` module\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade zookeeper to 3.6.0\r\n2. Upgrade curator to 5.1.0\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nI am disappointment with shortestResponseLoadBalance，though  it  is better than others in latency spike. However, it’s slow for it  depends on average.I am looking forwad to a sensitive loadbance.\r\n\r\nPeakEwmaLoadBalance is designed to converge quickly when encountering slow endpoints.\r\nIt is quick to react to latency spikes recovering only cautiously.Peak EWMA takes history into account,so that slow behavior is penalized relative to the supplied `decayTime`.\r\n\r\nInspiration drawn from:[finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/1bc837c4feafc0096e43c0e98516a8e1c50c4421/finagle-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/loadbalancer/PeakEwma.scala)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n-  calculate cost by exponential moving averages\r\n-  add decayTime\r\n-  ignore invoker‘s weight\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\nQ: Why decayTime default value is 10_000 ?\r\nA: It's hard to find an appropriate default value, so refer to apisix first.\r\n\r\nQ: Why does peakEwmaLoadBalance ignore weight?\r\nA: PeakEwmaLoadBalance pays more attention to rt，as for weight，equal costs only appear in very few scenes. What's\r\nmore,the node weights are equal  in most case, for instance, cloud native scene.Though dubbo works in different weight scene, active will help in traffic distribution.\r\n\r\nQ: Why does it add lock to `observe`?\r\nA: For calculating cost and updating some rt related parameters.\r\n\r\n## note\r\nWe will have a try first and  feed back to the community in time.\r\n\r\n##

a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-09T09:08:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-12T12:07:07Z","closed_at":"2021-09-12T12:07:07Z","merged_at":"2021-09-12T12:07:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7fa549cfa816bee280b1a2a2e17d91d59118599","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1efbf108f604b64785bbe8e71b8ff1884314788c","head":{"label":"changfubai:issue-8726-master","ref":"issue-8726-master","sha":"1efbf108f604b64785bbe8e71b8ff1884314788c","user":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":396754276,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY3NTQyNzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"changfubai/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n临时解决 #6404 问题。\r\nTemporary solution for #6404 issue.\r\n\r\nProvider优雅停机时，Consumer中MetadataService的DubboInvoder没有销毁，导致ReferenceCountExchangeClient.referenceCount没有正常-1的问题。\r\n然后导致ReconnectTimerTask重连异常日志。\r\n\r\nWhen the Provider shuts down gracefully, the DubboInvoder of the MetadataService in the Consumer is not destroyed, resulting in the problem of ReferenceCountExchangeClient.referenceCount not being normal -1.\r\nThen cause the ReconnectTimerTask to reconnect to the abnormal log.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nignore MetadataService destroy\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\na temp pull request to solve  ReconnectTimerTask reconnect error log。Please help me to check，thx.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-09T08:33:05Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T02:55:29Z","closed_at":"2021-09-10T02:55:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9443863ee3b223d0af84a1f805afa5ce84865f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f000814a2c41893d815b5e8416345c8124caa56d","head":{"label":"YsoulM:issue-6404-3.0","ref":"issue-6404-3.0","sha":"f000814a2c41893d815b5e8416345c8124caa56d","user":{"login":"YsoulM","id":13176005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM","html_url":"https://github.com/YsoulM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":404641012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDQ2NDEwMTI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"YsoulM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"YsoulM","id":13176005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM","html_url":"https://github.com/YsoulM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YsoulM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/YsoulM/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-09T07:59:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T03:02:18Z","closed_at":"2021-09-11T13:40:50Z","merged_at":"2021-09-11T13:40:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"d3773a774eeaed66d4997519805c14c3f5fb15de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/81c9d81c94b08a7ad0c167096c489f5cc25935e3","head":{"label":"changfubai:issue-8715-master","ref":"issue-8715-master","sha":"81c9d81c94b08a7ad0c167096c489f5cc25935e3","user":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":396754276,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY3NTQyNzY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"changfubai/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changfubai","id":20989201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg5MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20989201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai","html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changfubai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changfubai/dubbo","description":"Apache

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:14Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:20Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:20Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2937af0499221f33e32ebd9b0935049045aba55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4ed4a5fd32e77271728aa5234d9fd094f611b024","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0908_add_catch","ref":"0908_add_catch","sha":"4ed4a5fd32e77271728aa5234d9fd094f611b024","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:02Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:30Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:29Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T11:43:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"09f1f9a3d2db2888953a90816abcc24f5640fc5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/41d2d54c8dbff07f7b5ce24011498d1912cdf422","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0908_fix_config","ref":"0908_fix_config","sha":"41d2d54c8dbff07f7b5ce24011498d1912cdf422","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n* Judge whether success or not by user's perspective in interface-appName mapping.\r\n* By the way, format the function `MetadataServiceNameMapping#map`: change the indent spaces from 8 to 4.\r\n\r\nFixes #8722 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nEvery time the provider restarted after the first start,  it would raise an error \"Failed register interface application mapping......\".\r\nBut from the user's perspective, it means successful when the oldConfigContent has contained the current appName. So we should not throw an Exception to the user, it will confuse the user.\r\n\r\nJust change one line code：\r\n```java\r\n// => org.apache.dubbo.registry.client.metadata.MetadataServiceNameMapping#map\r\npublic boolean map(URL url) {\r\n    // ......\r\n    if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(oldConfigContent)) {\r\n        boolean contains = StringUtils.isContains(oldConfigContent, appName);\r\n        if (contains) {\r\n            // From user's perspective, it means successful when the oldConfigContent has contained the current appName. So we should not throw an Exception to user, it will confuse user.\r\n            succeeded = true;   // <= The only changes for this function.\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        newConfigContent = oldConfigContent + COMMA_SEPARATOR + appName;\r\n    }\r\n    // ......\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the `map` function is only called by `ServiceConfig#export`，the changes are safe.\r\n```java\r\n// => org.apache.dubbo.config.ServiceConfig#export\r\nprotected void exported() {\r\n    exported = true;\r\n    List<URL> exportedURLs = this.getExportedUrls();\r\n

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-08T01:01:40Z","updated_at":"2021-09-11T13:40:31Z","closed_at":"2021-09-11T13:40:30Z","merged_at":"2021-09-11T13:40:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"a09cece9d5cc8f9ce47629329a12d40cc244a62d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f77401bd41557619862d2662efa17ee2751ab713","head":{"label":"icankeep:3.0-up-dev-issue#8715","ref":"3.0-up-dev-issue#8715","sha":"f77401bd41557619862d2662efa17ee2751ab713","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-07T14:55:45Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T07:46:47Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T07:46:47Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T07:46:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"5bf321c78a8a9fad11442933d9bf0f24fe835d9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1b9d4e9772289537c1fe08f0c07f87de588eeb0a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0907_opt_application_model","ref":"0907_opt_application_model","sha":"1b9d4e9772289537c1fe08f0c07f87de588eeb0a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-07T14:55:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T00:13:19Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T00:13:19Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T00:13:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"1eee76e052c351060a8b4a7e134fb495701c2379","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42/labels","id":7059958,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n2","number":42,"title":"3.0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":61,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z","due_on":"2021-09-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/acb1b58af62239086a9b6eca9607dfd945565cef","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0907_add_serialization_waen","ref":"0907_add_serialization_waen","sha":"acb1b58af62239086a9b6eca9607dfd945565cef","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-07T08:58:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T14:06:59Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T05:41:53Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T05:41:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"3aa71682a92a26e773a579435b73704046b37fe9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e0f28710bd454863961d06e7423f7c0ecfe00fa0","head":{"label":"x-shadow-man:feat/remove-triple-rpc-exception","ref":"feat/remove-triple-rpc-exception","sha":"e0f28710bd454863961d06e7423f7c0ecfe00fa0","user":{"login":"x-shadow-man","id":25278283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25278283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man","html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":401980464,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDE5ODA0NjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"x-shadow-man/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"x-shadow-man","id":25278283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25278283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man","html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-07T02:14:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T10:24:34Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T08:19:17Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T08:19:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"806850515bdd45da6f53980b1b35300377ea072e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8ae4285d7a82a6703ad288d120b5380b1cec1f77","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix-tri-stream-md","ref":"fix-tri-stream-md","sha":"8ae4285d7a82a6703ad288d120b5380b1cec1f77","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"7ffa53ad0fbd5c4c69c802a3bbe0c172cdcb9ff9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2F

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-06T16:44:32Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T13:39:05Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T03:05:07Z","merged_at":"2021-09-07T03:05:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"bdd253f8eeea0e256e2e037aa867b272de442625","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6c2addba90f69d146e4afa4e3fdaa5c3f6f4bc3f","head":{"label":"zhuangjinjin:dev_issue#8685","ref":"dev_issue#8685","sha":"6c2addba90f69d146e4afa4e3fdaa5c3f6f4bc3f","user":{"login":"zhuangjinjin","id":3142281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDIyODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3142281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangjinjin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangjinjin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"7ffa53ad0fbd5c4c69c802a3bbe0c172cdcb9ff9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-05T09:40:20Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T07:24:02Z","closed_at":"2021-09-06T07:24:02Z","merged_at":"2021-09-06T07:24:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a9276d7bff60b7baddb9416eee2090a9711936f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/294f327b326584d20d8da24011606b45a7f02399","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0904_fix_service_repository","ref":"0904_fix_service_repository","sha":"294f327b326584d20d8da24011606b45a7f02399","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-03T13:35:18Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T10:33:15Z","closed_at":"2021-09-05T04:50:30Z","merged_at":"2021-09-05T04:50:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c8662e99ebdcc66f08d089bc3e7493e4d2d89cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f810ee7f8a4e5a1fcce4b5ab99e118abf2eb0dda","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0903_fix_application_model_destroy","ref":"0903_fix_application_model_destroy","sha":"f810ee7f8a4e5a1fcce4b5ab99e118abf2eb0dda","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-03T03:48:11Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T09:04:18Z","closed_at":"2021-09-06T09:04:18Z","merged_at":"2021-09-06T09:04:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d545d535ca6bec022a4bc91179502e9a5f8c5689","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8668/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8668/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8668/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f77545d4178335279feeaefb8a8f672519eb8b0a","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-error-callback","ref":"fix-error-callback","sha":"f77545d4178335279feeaefb8a8f672519eb8b0a","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-02T08:24:39Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T08:24:07Z","closed_at":"2021-09-02T09:54:21Z","merged_at":"2021-09-02T09:54:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff39bf36c35316061e7e028abd28dd392405e7f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a68aee9e7d01840e2b4de9c467442305babd87c4","head":{"label":"apache:3.0-multi-instances","ref":"3.0-multi-instances","sha":"a68aee9e7d01840e2b4de9c467442305babd87c4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-01T10:50:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-02T06:08:24Z","closed_at":"2021-09-02T06:08:24Z","merged_at":"2021-09-02T06:08:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8de0a7fd505a438b35e0db2a3e660aed33784dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c51a003d61fcaea9b1c9982b96d1267ea3ef5adc","head":{"label":"EarthChen:avoid-method-error","ref":"avoid-method-error","sha":"c51a003d61fcaea9b1c9982b96d1267ea3ef5adc","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"2c5d60f21455c674f7f70d473fb7e0c6c1b466fe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-31T08:14:19Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T09:04:54Z","closed_at":"2021-08-31T11:22:00Z","merged_at":"2021-08-31T11:22:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"23e2f4d46f41297c9a0fd7c6dbf757cf41ff7423","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42/labels","id":7059958,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n2","number":42,"title":"3.0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":61,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z","due_on":"2021-09-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4d924a1d3003a962b92aa5742604d0a65143216d","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:3.0_feature/unit_test_remote_refer_for_registry","ref":"3.0_feature/unit_test_remote_refer_for_registry","sha":"4d924a1d3003a962b92aa5742604d0a65143216d","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-31T07:16:57Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T05:47:21Z","closed_at":"2021-09-01T05:55:16Z","merged_at":"2021-09-01T05:55:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d848941818709c822b70e2b57606b8f628b25fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a98c83d7701430274db1d067e688e818f11c4e74","head":{"label":"EarthChen:feature/tri-health","ref":"feature/tri-health","sha":"a98c83d7701430274db1d067e688e818f11c4e74","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"3f591501a68c43e2798adb51ae362d6ca55e8f3b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
