are a few things that needed fixing:\r\n\r\n1. `template_fields_renderers` needed to be serialised for MappedOperator so the web view can render the fields correctly.\r\n2. A bug was accidentally introduced in #21641 that caused `render_templates()` to always be called by `TaskInstance.get_rendered_template_fields()`. This is now fixed.\r\n3. To allow templated fields to be rendered on the correct operator instance (the _unmapped_ one), `unmap()` needs to support serialised operators. This is conceptually impossible, but can be approximated by unmapping into a `SerializedBaseOperator` and copy all the attributes from `MappedOperator` to it. This is good enough for cases where task instance fields are pre-rendered, since `RenderedTaskInstanceFields` would be able to re-populate the real attributes; for fields not yet rendered (i.e. from a DAG that’s never run), `/rendered-templates` has always been inaccurate, so it’s not that big a deal to not able to correctly populate all the fields (and it’s impossible anyway).\r\n4. Another consequence on supporting `unmap()` is that we need to get rid of its side effect of replacing the mapped task with an unmapped one in the DAG, because the webserver won’t be able to recover from this replacement and would lose all operator-mapping information if we do that. Fortunately, I believe the task replacement is not needed in the first place, and can be avoided entirely without consequences. Furthermore, we already have a mechanism for unmapping a task without adding it to the DAG (the task validation API); we just need to rename the argument and attribute to reflect its broader usage.\r\n\r\nNote the clicking on the _Rendered_ button still **does not work** after this PR, because the button is currently missing a correct `map_index` argument. We need to tweak the modal to be able to display a mapped task correctly. cc @bbovenzi

the /rendered-templates view may fail to render a task if it cannot successfully call `get_rendered_template_fields`. However, instead of *adding* things to MappedOperator, I think we are currently not handling the operator-unmapping boundary correctly and are carrying too much information on the class to do what it shouldn't do.\r\n\r\nTherefore, here I'm trying to *remove* things from MappedOperator and let the rendering code always use the unmapped operator. Let's see if this would work. I have a mind to remove some more fields if this turns out to be viable.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

execution_date -> run_id change (#21960) attempted to make it\r\nAirflow 2.1 backwards-compatible, but the problem is that in\r\nAirflo2 2.1 retrieving `run_id` attribute of TaskInstance throws\r\nAttributeError rather than returns None. It turns out that when\r\nyou have a field defined in an ORM model, it will never throw\r\nAtributeError (even if you delete the attribute it will return\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nAccesising `run_id` with getattr raises\r\nAttributeError in Airflow 2.1 (because there TaskInstance has no\r\nrun_id defined).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds automated pre-commit to check if other providers\r\nhave not suffered (and will not suffer) the same problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

include downstream tasks with `ALL_SUCCESS` `trigger_rule` to prevent tasks from being wrongly skipped by `schedule_after_task_execution`.\r\n\r\nFIXES #19222\r\n\r\nThe reported issue started after #18338: Fix mini scheduler not respecting wait_for_downstream dep\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pendulum\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python_operator import BranchPythonOperator\r\nfrom airflow.sensors.python import PythonSensor\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.utils.trigger_rule import TriggerRule\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_wrong_skip\",\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    start_date=pendulum.DateTime(2022, 1, 1),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    branch = BranchPythonOperator(task_id=\"branch\", python_callable=lambda: \"task_b\")\r\n    task_a = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_a\", python_callable=lambda: True)\r\n    task_b = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_b\", python_callable=lambda: True)\r\n    task_c = PythonSensor(task_id=\"task_c\", python_callable=lambda: False)\r\n    task_d = PythonOperator(task_id=\"task_d\", python_callable=lambda: True, trigger_rule=TriggerRule.NONE_FAILED_MIN_ONE_SUCCESS)\r\n\r\n    branch >> [task_a, task_b]\r\n    [task_a, task_c] >> task_d\r\n```\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-06 at 9 20 51 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/152707755-771f3ccd-87ea-4efa-b7e6-5cf9d5b2c268.png)\r\n\r\nObserve that `task_d` which has `none_failed_min_one_success` trigger_rule is skipped before `task_c` even finishes. This violates the `trigger_rule` logic of `none_failed_min_one_success`.\r\n\r\nThis happens because #18338 changed the following line to `include_downstream=True`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            partial_dag = task.dag.partial_subset(\r\n                task.downstream_task_ids,\r\n                include_downstream=True,\r\n                include_upstream=False,\r\n                include_direct_upstream=True,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat change caused the `partial_dag` in the \"mini scheduler\" to include all downstream tasks (even the indirect downstream tasks).\r\n\r\nIn the reproducing example, once `branch` finishes, it creates a `partial_dag` which includes `task_a`, `task_b` and `task_d` (but does not include `task_c` because it's not downstream of `branch`). Looking at only this `partial_dag`, the \"mini scheduler\" determines that `task_d` can be skipped because its only upstream task in `partial_dag` `task_a` is in skipped state. This happens in `DagRun._get_ready_tis()` when calling `st.are_dependencies_met()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by making the \"mini scheduler\" only skip tasks that have `trigger_rule` `ALL_SUCCESS`.","created_at":"2022-03-19T08:24:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T10:54:08Z","closed_at":"2022-04-26T10:54:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16ad7d18b8817d00b9e17c62fa323e080f277ba9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

XComArg uses hasattr duck-typing to determine if it needs to recurse into an object's `template_fields`. However, this errornously lets it calls `__getattr__` on certain objects that raises unexpected errors.\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on duck-typing, this patch makes the check strictly uses inheritance, making XComArg only recurse into `template_fields` if the object is an operator. This avoids `__getattr__` being unexpectedly called, and thus making the logic work better with other parts of the code base.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be triggered by the following DAG:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@task\r\ndef a_list():\r\n    return [3, 6, 9]\r\n​\r\n@task\r\ndef ref_context(num, **context):\r\n    pass\r\n​\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"ref_context\", start_date=datetime(1970, 1, 1)) as dag:\r\n    ref_context.expand(num=a_list())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following exception is raised:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/decorators/base.py\", line 172, in execute\r\n    return_value = super().execute(context)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/operators/python.py\", line 169, in execute\r\n    self.op_kwargs = self.determine_kwargs(context)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py\", line 1005, in __setattr__\r\n    self.set_xcomargs_dependencies()\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py\", line 1112, in set_xcomargs_dependencies\r\n    XComArg.apply_upstream_relationship(self, arg)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/xcom_arg.py\", line 169, in apply_upstream_relationship\r\n    XComArg.apply_upstream_relationship(op, elem)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/xcom_arg.py\", line 169, in apply_upstream_relationship\r\n    XComArg.apply_upstream_relationship(op, elem)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/xcom_arg.py\", line 170, in apply_upstream_relationship\r\n    elif hasattr(arg, \"template_fields\"):\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/utils/context.py\", line 100, in __getattr__\r\n    self.var = Variable.get(key, deserialize_json=self._deserialize_json)\r\n  File \"/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/models/variable.py\", line 138, in get\r\n    raise KeyError(f'Variable {key} does not exist')\r\nKeyError: 'Variable template_fields does not exist'\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause the `hasattr` call triggers\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/ecc5b74528ed7e4ecf05c526feb2c0c85f463429/airflow/utils/context.py#L97-L101\r\n\r\nBut `Variable.get()` raises an unexpected `KeyError`.\r\n\r\nNote: The same problem also exists for `ConnectionAccessor`; `Connection.get_connection_from_secrets()` raises `AirflowNotFoundException` when a connection is not found. An alternative fix is to catch these exceptions and re-raise `AttributeError` in those `__getattr__` implementations (which is caught by `hasattr` to return False), but IMO the current fix proposed in this PR is better since it guards against future custom objects.","created_at":"2022-03-18T10:41:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T16:49:33Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T12:39:31Z","merged_at":"2022-03-23T12:39:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f51a674dd907a00e4bd9b4b44fb036d28762b5cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

#19857 we enabled storing connections as JSON instead of URI and renamed get_conn_uri to get_conn_value to be consistent with this change.  The method get_conn_uri is now deprecated and should warn when used.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates secrets backends in providers to implement the new method, while retaining support for the old method for backcompat.  We cannot remove the old methods until min airflow version is updated to 2.3 for the provider.\r\n\r\nFor users of Airflow versions older than 2.3 we suppress the deprecation warning since it's only from 2.3 onward that the warning makes sense (below 2.3, get_conn_uri is called; in 2.3 we call get_conn_value

difficult dropping unnamed foreign, primary, or unique key constraints on MSSQL. This is because\r\nthe constraints are arbitrarily named by MSSQL, making it impossible to guess. To drop it, we had to run\r\na query to locate the constraints. This breaks offline generation of SQL for MSSQL because alembic can't connect\r\nto the DB when using the offline mode.\r\n\r\nWith this change, all constraints that are not explicitly named will have a name, and the name will be the\r\nsame across all databases.\r\n\r\nUsing the naming convention, we can easily give the name of the key we want to drop instead of running some\r\nquerries to locate the name in MSSQL.\r\n\r\nThe connection unique key constraint on conn_id was also updated to follow the new convention","created_at":"2022-03-17T02:17:05Z","updated_at":"2022-05-29T00:13:13Z","closed_at":"2022-05-29T00:13:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ec09c6559030cf0052902a086f1a52c64fd2832","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://a

\r\n\r\nI noticed there was no airflow file sensor suitable for Azure Data Lake Storage.

everyone,\r\n\r\nI am really excited to show you the collective work of the last few weeks!\r\nThis is the initial PR that prepares Airflow to be compliant with\r\n[AIP-47](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-47+New+design+of+Airflow+System+Tests) which is related to the new design of system tests in Airflow. This is the first step to automated system tests in our CI. When it is merged, it will enable other providers to start migration of their system tests to the new design.\r\n\r\nBasically, the main advantage of this design is that we will have self-contained tests encapsulated in DAGs that can be run with pytest as well as just imported into Airflow and be executed there. Requirements for the environment are kept at minimum and are mostly related to specific test needs. By using built-in features of Airflow, each system test is a DAG that is also an example of usage for tested Operator. All in one, in a simple file :)\r\n\r\nIt is a minimal PR that contains a bunch of tests for only 1 Google service (BigQuery) and everything else that is required by the tests to be working properly. It also consists of all necessary documentation, new pre-commit hook (`check-watcher-in-examples`), updated checks (in `tests/always`) and some other things. More tests will be migrated in a separate PRs, because we wanted this one to be as small as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease familiarize with the changes and also read the AIP-47 to fully understand why they are needed.\r\nWe really want to hear your feedback. In case of any questions, concerns or comments - we are here to answer them and explain things. The whole work was overseen by @potiuk and done together with @bhirsz and @kosteev and me (@mnojek).","created_at":"2022-03-16T14:11:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T20:21:46Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T13:46:14Z","merged_at":"2022-03-25T13:46:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c7cd4731937652271fc1180a74e9a3af3dd211d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

our warnings, our users continue treating the Docker\r\nCompose that we exposed as something that should be easy to\r\nextend and customize for their own needs, yet they continue\r\nto struggle with some basic behaviour of containers, Docker Compose\r\nand how they interact. This results in vast space of potential\r\nproblems as Docker Compose gives the user a false premise of\r\nsomething that \"just works\" where it requires quite a deep\r\nunderstanding on how it works.\r\n\r\nWhen you get things wrong with Docker Compose, you often end up\r\nwith extremely confusing messages, that might suggest that the\r\nproblem is with Airflow, but really the problem is with how users\r\ninteract with their custom Docker images, registries, pulling,\r\nnetworking, mounting volumes and plenty other things.\r\n\r\nWhile this is the same with Kubernetes and Helm Chart, Helm Chart makes\r\nit infinitely easier to customize in declarative way (this is what\r\nour values.yaml does) and anything that has not been foreseen by Helm\r\nChart developers is \"hard\" by definition.\r\n\r\nDocker Compose makes no such distinction. You really can't make Docker\r\nCompose customizable by configuration, and any customization in it\r\nrequires modifying the compose file and for people who do not know\r\nwhat they are doing will eventually lead to errors that they are not\r\nable to diagnose and leads to creation of \"Airlfow isssues\", where they\r\nshould be brought to \"Docker Compose\" issues.\r\n\r\nExample of that is here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/22301\r\nwhere there are at least two issues that are not reproducible without\r\nknowing in detail what the user has done, how the image was build\r\nand distributed, and how the docker-compose installation interacted\r\nwith them. This leads to a terrible distraction for supporting\r\nusers of Airflow as the issues are really Docker Compose issues and\r\nAirflow maintainers should not be involved in solving those.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bit stronger language and statement about the scope\r\nand customizability of the Quick Start Docker Compose of ours. Not\r\nonly mentioning \"Lack of Production Readiness\" but also the\r\nresponsibility of the user to understand and diagnose docker compose\r\nerrors on their own and setting expectations that issues with Docker\r\nCompose running should be directed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

makes multiple ti-related views take an additional parameter `map_index` (optional, defaults to -1 if not given for unmapped tasks). But I’m not really sure how to actually _pass_ the argument in those. Also `map_index` is added to `list_columns` for views to models with that field.\r\n\r\nSome oddities not handled in this PR that need to be fixed later:\r\n\r\n* `/success` and `/failed` set state to a task (and potentially its upstreams/downstreams). It feels a bit weird to be able to set the state to only one mapped task? Also upstream/downstream makes less sense if any of those are mapped. So I’m currently leaving these views alone (i.e. setting success/failed to a mapped task sets the state of all mapped tis).

the SparkKubernetes operator is based on[ spark-on-k8s-operator ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator)project. \r\n\r\nWhile it is a good first step but it just accepts yaml file to create a spark job. Moreover, the built-in functionality for the operators is not available e.g., error handling, log management, retry, delete job, timeout, etc. It is not also designed to be used by Data Scientists and other users that are not familiar with Kubernetes yaml specification. \r\n\r\nThis PR reimplements the SparkKubernetes operator to add functionalities to simplify the interface and accept different parameters in Python. Similar to the KubernetesOperator, we have added the logic to wait for a job after submission, manage error handling, retrieve logs from the driver pod, ability to delete a spark job. It also supports out-of-the-box Kubernetes functionalities such as handling volumes, config maps, secrets, etc.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-14T16:43:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-14T21:52:49Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T13:26:30Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T13:26:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa25affec68fe1ddcaa162ecfbd4199156bb88d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

working through the tutorial, some parts seemed a bit unclear or incorrect, which took me to issue #18950 ( converted into discussion #22233 about 15 minutes ago). I had already resolved some of the open concerns and saw potiuk encouraging people to improve the documentation, so I took it upon myself.\r\n\r\nMain Changes:\r\n* Wrote tasks to handle db-table-creation in the DAG rather than leave that as an exercise for the reader.\r\n* Added a step to ensure the existence of the data output directory in the `get_data()` task.\r\n* Fixed the logic in the `merge_data()` task so that its behavior matches the stated description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description
