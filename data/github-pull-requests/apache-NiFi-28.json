allowing settings below the default of 10.\r\n\r\nThe original implementation checked the requested Max Thread Count against the current core pool size, and did not apply the changes if the Max Thread Count was less than current.

More details in the issue.\r\n\r\nOne case where this can happen is in a custom processor using Apache Tika. Passing the InputStream created of a flowfile by the processSession to Tika exposes the bug, since it uses the mark and reset feature extensively.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new buffer when the stream is marked to buffer the readLimit (which is the primary cause why it was introduced in NIFI-10888). It also throws the buffer away during reset, if a reset within the buffer is not possible. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

properties files using env vars in Docker Containers\r\n\r\nRefreshes the original work by @yarox in #4008, rebased against latest `main` and extended to cover `apache/nifi-registry` along with `apache/nifi` images.\r\n\r\n- Allows for the specification of general env vars to cover any properties to be updated or added before instance startup.\r\n- Caters for existing env vars where they don't match the property names to be populated.\r\n- Allows for the injection of sensitive properties using files and referencing those via an env var, e.g. for passwords, sensitive keys or secrets\r\n- Fixes various inconsistencies between `dockermaven` and `dockerhub` scripts in NiFi and NiFi Registry (also tidies up some issues around OIDC env vars for Registry)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] update documentation\r\n- [ ] build and test images for different env var use cases (e.g. mixed-case properties)\r\n- [ ] rebase branch to single commit (left as multiple currently for retaining original work)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

However, it adds a bit more. Record processing comes with a significant amount of boilerplate code, which varies slightly between processors. As far as I can tell, this difference most of the time has nothing to do with the processor's requirements, but it is related to when it was written and what was the accepted approach at that time. In addition to that, responsibilities are not well separated in such code. Often record reading, writing, provenance event, counter, and business logic handling can be observed in the same method. Because of that, it is not that easy to deal with them.\r\n\r\nI tried to come up with a generic concept for the above problems. This is what can be found under the `strategy` package. The concept revolves around the nature of the processor. Hence the naming `MessagePublisher/Consumer`. I didn't want to modify the existing behavior of the jms processor around single message processing, but this concept can support single message processing too. Now, it is just a vision, but it enables us to configure the `MessagePublisher/Consumer` in the `@OnSchedule` method based on whether we want standard or record processing, eliminating the need of `if(record) { doRecordProcessing } else { doStandardProcessing }` in the `onTrigger` method. I'm curious about your thoughts, and I'm looking forward to your advice! I'm sure there will be, at least in the naming.\r\n\r\nIf you like the idea, my goal would be to improve it either in this pr or in a following one depending on the nature of the change. But it would stay in the current bundle. When it is ready, it could be moved to a common bundle so other processors can rely on it.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11195](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11195) Refactors the `IdentityMappingUtil` and `IdentityMapping` classes from `nifi-security-utils` to `nifi-security-identity` in order to reduce the dependency tree for several modules.\r\n\r\nPart of the changes include refactoring Peer Identity extraction from `CertificateUtils` to the two Site-to-Site modules that require the methods.\r\n\r\nAdjusting the dependencies for `nifi-site-to-site-client` uncovered implied transitive dependencies on `nifi-properties` in multiple modules related to the use of the NiFi `StringUtils` class. Moving this class from `nifi-properties` to the shared `nifi-property-utils` module maintains existing functionality while reducing implied dependencies on `nifi-properties` in several modules.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11191](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11191) Refactors the `HikariCPConnectionPoolTest` class using a `MockDriver` class to avoid intermittent failures related to concurrency and file locking when using Apache Derby.\r\n\r\nThe existing test class attempted to work around locking issues using specialized temporary file handling for the Derby database and associated the logs. The `MockDriver` approach avoids these issues and focuses the test on confirming whether the Controller Service returns a Connection.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11188) Removes the deprecated `ProcessContext.encrypt` and `ProcessContext.decrypt` methods from the interface and implementations. These methods were deprecated for removal in NiFi 1.20.0 and removing deprecated JMS processors eliminated remaining references from the project.\r\n\r\nRemoving these methods reduced the need to pass around instance of `PropertyEncryptor` and eliminated the need for several tests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

No unit tests were written; most other auditors do not have unit tests either. However, it was tested/verified in a running nifi.\r\n\r\nRequest reviewer pay particular attention to the AspectJ annotations in LabelAuditor.java. I used other Auditor classes as a model, but I was unfamiliar with these annotations initially.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11134](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11134)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nInstalled and started NiFi.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11165](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11165) Removes the optional `jigaw` profiles and associated startup code that provided JAXB API and associated dependencies as part of the standard application class path.\r\n\r\nRemoving the optional profiles aligns with the NiFi 2.0 Release Goal of removing support for Java 8 and requiring Java 11 as the minimum version.\r\n\r\nThe changes move the JAXB API and implementation libraries into standard module dependencies where required. In several modules, such as the Kafka components, usage of the JAXB `DatatypeConverter` was replaced with Java Base64 and Apache Commons Codec Hex utilities. With JAXB removed from the standard Java Runtime in Java 11, the JAXB API and implementation libraries must be included as direct dependencies when necessary.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Meanwhile, all credentials are indeed supported (defined by the `AzureStorageCredentialsType` enum):\r\n\r\n- Account key\r\n- SAS token\r\n- Access token\r\n- Managed identity\r\n- Service principal\r\n\r\nThe logic of the authentication code is that it's a SAS token (provided directly or derived using an account key) or it's based on OAuth2 (which captures the remaining cases).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Apache NiFi

There are two things worth mentioning. There was an exception propagation in ConsumeJMS. The comment next to it doesn't really make sense. In 2020 a commit was added, which even caught all exceptions in the Abstract class. I tried to figure out what the expectation would be. Propagate it according to the original behavior, or go forward and remove the rethrow part. I decided to do the latter because propagating the exception doesn't make sense in this case. There is no upstream connection, and when \"consume\" fails, there won't be a flowfile in the output relationship, so rollback is unnecessary, which could be triggered by the exception.\r\nThe other thing is testMultiplethreads(). It failed with timeout because we reached a limit after publishing a thousand messages. It is probably related to [this](https://activemq.apache.org/how-to-deal-with-large-number-of-threads-in-clients). I tried multiple different configurations without luck. It is a hint, but maybe not all of them work with the test broker implementation. Ultimately I decided to set the total messages to that threshold. This way, we can spare the additional configuration, and one thousand messages should be enough for the purpose of the test.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11094](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11094) This PR refactors CaptureChangeMySQL to support two modes of operation, N events per FlowFile and one transaction per FlowFile. The default is N events per FlowFile with N set to 1 to retain existing behavior (1 event per FlowFile). However now this number is configurable, or the user can choose to output a FlowFile with all events between BEGIN and COMMIT events. The latter can help with downstream processing, as PutDatabaseRecord treats a FlowFile as a transaction so failure handling can be more consistent.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the
