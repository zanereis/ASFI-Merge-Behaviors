Overview\r\n\r\nIn query for `all_docs` with passed `keys` array it is possible for `doc_receive_loop/6` to timeout and trigger `badmatch` exception.\r\n\r\nThe fix changes code to accept `timeout` as a possible response and passes it to Callback to process.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to induce timeout on that all_docs read without actual code tweaking, so base tests just need to pass.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nDescribed in #2149 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n-

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nThe problem was originally exposed when updating search index with the following error:\r\n```\r\n{error, \"*** eval: {'EXIT',{{badmatch,{error,<<\"Lock obtain timed out: NativeFSLock@/srv/search_index/shards/20000000-3fffffff/user1/db1.1509715496/ec8bc1dc690a15d795e65f7dce409e2c/write.lock\">>}},\\n                   [{erl_eval,expr,3,[]}]}}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, it turns out that the soft-deletion path is missing a call to evict the shard from LRU (and therefore release the associated locks). This causes that lock file was left in working directory and search index failed to be updated.\r\n\r\nTo address this, the fix is to close the corresponding index in LRU before index is to be renamed/deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n@theburge made excellent troubleshooting and analysis, and also wrote below script to reproduce problem.\r\n\r\n[repro2.sh.txt](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/files/3797041/repro2.sh.txt)\r\n\r\nThe problem doesn't occur after using the fix here and cloudant-labs/clouseau#23\r\n## Related

Overview \r\n\r\nWhen the `_scheduler/docs` response is generated, the replication docs are\r\nparsed and credentials are stripped by `couch_replicator:strip_url_creds/1`.\r\nWhen local endpoint support was removed, that function didn't properly catch\r\nthe parsing error for local endpoints and as a result was error-ing out the\r\nwhole response.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to catch the error and return the endpoint as is. The catch is\r\nspecific to that error, so turned the long binary message into a shorter, but\r\nhopefully still obvious atom.\r\n\r\n`_scheduler/docs` response would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"docs\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"database\": \"_replicator\",\r\n            \"doc_id\": \"r\",\r\n            \"error_count\": 1,\r\n            \"id\": null,\r\n            \"info\": \"local_endpoints_not_supported\",\r\n            \"last_updated\": \"2019-08-20T16:09:53Z\",\r\n            \"source\": \"http://adm:*****@127.0.0.1:15984/s/\",\r\n            \"start_time\": \"2019-08-20T16:09:53Z\",\r\n            \"state\": \"failed\",\r\n            \"target\": \"t\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"offset\": 0,\r\n    \"total_rows\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, there was already a test for this case, except it wasn't\r\nincluded in the EUnit test suite list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are

debugged the failing `CompactTest` test case and have managed to find the root cause of the failure.\r\n\r\nAfter understanding the logic of the test case and tracing the code flow, I realised that the failure happened due to the incorrect assert check at the following location:-\r\n\thttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/test/elixir/test/compact_test.exs#L46\r\n\r\nThis is because the final data size after deletion & further compaction is more than the deleted data size after only deletion, but not compaction.\r\nThe opposite was being checked due to which the test case was failing consistently.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the values of the variables in question that I managed to trace:-\r\n\r\n\t\tCompactTest\r\n\t\t  * test compaction reduces size of deleted docs\r\n\r\n\t\tValue of orig_data_size = 4436.\r\n\r\n\t\tValue of orig_disk_size = 103907.\r\n\r\n\t\tValue of deleted_data_size = 7455.\r\n\r\n\t\tValue of final_data_size = 11924.\r\n\r\n\t\tValue of final_disk_size = 218681.\r\n\r\n\t\t  * test compaction reduces size of deleted docs (18819.2ms)\r\n\r\nI have made the necessary changes and submitted this PR for the above

Overview\r\n\r\nThere were couple of hacks in `test/elixir/lib/couch.ex`\r\nWe've got changes needed to remove them into `httpotion` 3.1.3.\r\nThe changes were introduced in:\r\n- https://github.com/myfreeweb/httpotion/pull/118\r\n- https://github.com/myfreeweb/httpotion/pull/130\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `httpotion` to 3.1.3 and removes the hacks from `couch.ex`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Make sure tests pass `make elixir`\r\n2. Make sure we set timeouts in calls to ibrowse\r\n2.1. Start iex `iex -S mix`\r\n2.2. Make sure calls to ibrowse have `.....{inactivity_timeout,55000}], 60000)`\r\n```\r\n# Start the default trace message receiver\r\n:dbg.tracer()\r\n# Setup call (c) tracing on current process\r\n:dbg.p(:erlang.pid_to_list(self()), :c)\r\n# Setup an exception return trace (x) on ibrowse:send_req\r\n:dbg.tp(:ibrowse, :send_req, :x)\r\nCouch.request!(:post, \"http://google.com\",

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is straightforward, just adjusting more timeouts in the Jenkins whack-a-mole game. The one novelty here is that some of these timeouts are not timeouts waiting for _any_ response, but timeouts waiting for a specific observable, e.g. that documents show up in the database after an async update.\r\n\r\nAs I'm only adjusting timeouts here and previous similar changes have already been approved I'm going to go ahead and merge this one.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/CouchDB/detail/jenkins-elixir-retry-until-flakes/6/\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\nWe had a number  of problems with using meck and eunit. In fact these problems were one of the driving factors to switch to exunit. ExUnit has a reliable teardown behaviour. Which allows as to do a proper cleanup after meck. This PR adds an unconditional call to :meck.unload() into `on_exit` callback. This would guaranty that we wouldn't have leftover mocked modules in subsequent tests.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nHard to test. \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- This

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

It tried to construct a version using git, but when building from a release tarball there is no git repo so the UA had a git error message in it. This error message contained a newline, which plausibly confused some part of the HTTP stack and caused replicator HTTP requests to hang.\r\n\r\nThe second commit removes the attempt to publish packages for Ubuntu 14.04, as we're no longer building them for that (EOL) platform.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSee https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/CouchDB/detail/jenkins-cpse-debugging/18/pipeline/, which is building this branch before my cleanup rebase (the final diff from master is identical).\r\n\r\nThe specific test that was quite regularly failing without this patch is `cpse_purge_http_replication`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides

Overview\r\n\r\nFix replication rescheduling Running < MaxJobs corner case\r\n\r\nPreviously, when total number of replication jobs exceed `MaxJobs`, if some  jobs crashed, additional jobs didn't start immediately to bring the running total up to the `MaxJobs` limit. Then, during rescheduling, the `Running == MaxJobs, Pending > 0` guard would fail and jobs would not rotate. In other words, if at least one job crashed, rotation didn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to simplify the rotation logic to handle the `Running < MaxJobs`  case. First, up to `Churn` number of jobs are stopped, then enough jobs are started to reach the `MaxJobs` limit. The rotation logic case handles the `start_pending_jobs/3` case so there is no need to call that separately before rotation happens.\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit

 Overview\r\n\r\nPrevious implementation of `fabric:cleanup_index_files` assembled a regexp by concatenating active signatures.\r\nThe approach caused regexp to exceed system limit in the case of huge number of them. \r\nThe stacktrace looked like follows: \r\n```\r\n2> fabric:cleanup_index_files().\r\n** exception error: no match of right hand side value {error,{\"regular expression is too large\",37555}}\r\n     in function  fabric:cleanup_index_files/1 (src/fabric.erl, line 519)\r\n     in call from fabric:'-cleanup_index_files/0-lc$^0/1-0-'/1 (src/fabric.erl, line 501)\r\n     in call from fabric:'-cleanup_index_files/0-lc$^0/1-0-'/1 (src/fabric.erl, line 501)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation uses different approach. It relies on the fact that view files are named as `${signature}.view`. This means that the signature of the file can be easily extracted using `filename:basename(FilePath, \".view\")`. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake exunit tests=src/couch/test/exunit/fabric_test.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\n`local` replication endpoints do something completely unexpected from a user's\r\npoint of view -- they replicate to and from node local databases on a random\r\nnode. The only way this worked correctly was if someone used the backend port\r\n(:5986) with a single node database. However, that port is getting closed for 3.x\r\nrelease as well, so it makes even less sense to keep this functionality around.\r\n\r\nFor more discussion and voting results see ML list:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ddcd9db93cee363db7da571f5cbc7f2bd24b881a34e1ef734d6a0a1c@%3Cdev.couchdb.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n The `_replicate` HTTP \"hack\" was left as is, since it does work more or less, however it is inconsistent with what `_replicator` docs do so we should probably mark it as deprecated and remove it in 4.x\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit`\r\n `make elixir`\r\n\r\nCreate a replication with a local db endpoint via _replicate and via _replicator\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [x] A PR for documentation changes has been made:

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a non-trivial refactor of the Jenkins setup:\r\n\r\n* Builds are moved back into the workspace. Parallel builds run in unique sub-folders which seems to avoid the clashes we had observed in the past.\r\n* The large build_script is split out into smaller parts as sequential stages. Cleanup operations are deferred to `post` actions to enable retrieval of the test results.\r\n* Test results are captured and saved in the Jenkins UI.\r\n* Various fixes to platform labels and configuration that should get the nightly builds running again.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThese two tests are reliably timing out on ARM hardware in Jenkins. They do a lot of individual btree operations so this is not entirely surprising. Appropriate course of action here is to raise the timeout.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis branch should get built automatically by Jenkins so we can confirm that it fixes the build there.\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that the timeout setting works correctly locally (e.g. by lowering it to 0.1 and watching those tests time out).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThese two tests are reliably timing out on ARM hardware in Jenkins. They do a lot of individual btree operations so this is not entirely surprising. Appropriate course of action here is to raise the timeout.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI don't know how to make Jenkins build a PR branch. If someone can do that, great. Otherwise we should probably just merge this and see how it does. I've confirmed that the timeout setting works correctly locally (e.g. by lowering it to 0.1 and watching those tests time out).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nEunit testing framework has a number of deficiencies especially in the cases when mocking is involved. This PR introduces Elixir based ExUnit into our testing stack. The PR doesn't include tests themselves. The tests would be included in separate PRs.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCreate `src/couch/test/exunit/crud_test.exs` with following content\r\n```\r\ndefmodule Couch.Test.CRUD do\r\n  use Couch.Test.ExUnit.Case\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Utils\r\n\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Setup\r\n\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Setup.Step\r\n\r\n  def with_db(context, setup) do\r\n    setup =\r\n      setup\r\n      |> Setup.Common.httpd_with_db()\r\n      |> Setup.run()\r\n\r\n    context =\r\n      Map.merge(context, %{\r\n        db_name: setup |> Setup.get(:db) |> Step.Create.DB.name(),\r\n        base_url: setup |> Setup.get(:start) |> Step.Start.clustered_url(),\r\n        user: setup |> Setup.get(:admin) |> Step.User.name()\r\n      })\r\n\r\n    {context, setup}\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  describe \"Database CRUD using Fabric API\" do\r\n    @describetag setup: &__MODULE__.with_db/2\r\n    test \"Create DB\", ctx do\r\n      IO.puts(\"base_url: #{ctx.base_url}\")\r\n      IO.puts(\"admin: #{ctx.user}\")\r\n      IO.puts(\"db_name: #{ctx.db_name}\")\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nCreate `src/couch/test/exunit/test_helper.exs` with the following content:\r\n```\r\nExUnit.configure(formatters: [JUnitFormatter, ExUnit.CLIFormatter])\r\nExUnit.start()`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- old PR https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2036 (the current PR is simplified by removing notion of testing adapter)\r\n- RFC https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/415\r\n- [Discussion on mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f842ca637f7cb06b34af699a793cab0a534e65970172e8117bf0b228@%3Cdev.couchdb.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-28T12:03:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T14:44:13Z","closed_at":"2019-07-29T14:44:09Z","merged_at":"2019-07-29T14:44:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"f37e1e73205e98d6a74a714a23c4a59f7cf2bb0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/25ad74a6cdc03732265d5175218e96a004dd4c40","head":{"label":"cloudant:exunit-simplified","ref":"exunit-simplified","sha":"25ad74a6cdc03732265d5175218e96a004dd4c40","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nThis contribution pulls in the \"Dreyfus\" OTP application, which teaches CouchDB how to communicate with the \"Clouseau\" Java application for Lucene-powered Search and Mango text indexes. Once this PR is merged it will no longer be necessary to use a custom fork of CouchDB in order to enable Search.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIn order to fully test this PR you'll need a build of Clouseau. Those can be found at\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/cloudant-labs/clouseau/releases\r\n\r\nThere's also a public Maven repo:\r\n\r\n* https://maven.cloudant.com/repo/com/cloudant/clouseau/\r\n\r\nI've gone ahead and built a Docker image which can be used with Kubernetes:\r\n\r\n* https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/kocolosk/couchdb-search\r\n\r\nand updated the upstream Helm chart to use it. If you want a one-liner to install CouchDB+Search on a Kube cluster of your choice you can try:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm install incubator/couchdb --set image.repository=kocolosk/couchdb,image.tag=dreyfus-by-default,clusterSize=1,enableSearch=true --name test-search\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\napache/couchdb-documentation#418\r\nhelm/charts#14822\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n\r\nPosting a draft PR for discussion. Will lift the draft flag once documentation and a Clouseau build are available.","created_at":"2019-05-25T13:00:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T14:10:33Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T14:10:32Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T14:10:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"cbf88041012cf634a80b4d1d036276844da988c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/c517618ba54892b0b5d26e529924af04b9e62f49","head":{"label":"kocolosk:dreyfus-by-default","ref":"dreyfus-by-default","sha":"c517618ba54892b0b5d26e529924af04b9e62f49","user":{"login":"kocolosk","id":16679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk","html_url":"https://github.com/kocolosk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445329,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDUzMjk=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"kocolosk/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kocolosk","id":16679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk","html_url":"https://github.com/kocolosk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kocolosk/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nEunit testing framework has a number of deficiencies especially in the cases when mocking is involved. This PR introduces Elixir based ExUnit into our testing stack. This work uses notion of testing adapter which allows us to write test suite once and reuse it to test using different interfaces:\r\n- fabric\r\n- clustered\r\n- backdoor\r\n\r\nThe PR doesn't include tests themselves. The tests would be included in separate PRs.\r\n\r\nHere is one example of how the test might look:\r\n```\r\ndefmodule Couch.Test.CRUD do\r\n  use ExUnit.Case\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Adapter\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Utils, as: Utils\r\n\r\n  alias Couch.Test.Setup\r\n\r\n  require Record\r\n\r\n  test_groups = [\r\n    \"using Clustered API\": Adapter.Clustered,\r\n    \"using Backdoor API\": Adapter.Backdoor,\r\n    \"using Fabric API\": Adapter.Fabric,\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n  for {describe, adapter} <- test_groups do\r\n    describe \"Database CRUD #{describe}\" do\r\n      @describetag setup: %Setup{}\r\n        |> Setup.Start.new([:chttpd])\r\n        |> Setup.Adapter.new(adapter)\r\n        |> Setup.Admin.new(user: \"adm\", password: \"pass\")\r\n        |> Setup.Login.new(user: \"adm\", password: \"pass\")\r\n      test \"Create\", %{setup: setup} do\r\n        db_name = Utils.random_name(\"db\")\r\n        setup_ctx = setup |> Setup.run()\r\n        assert {:ok, resp} = Adapter.create_db(Setup.get(setup_ctx, :adapter), db_name)\r\n        assert resp.body[\"ok\"]\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nUse `make exunit` to run all tests. \r\n\r\nYou can also use mix directly as follows:\r\n```\r\nBUILDDIR=`pwd` ERL_LIBS=`pwd`/src MIX_ENV=test mix test --trace\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-22T18:41:35Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T18:55:34Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T12:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7dcc3aafcbd8d2ed19fd9ff957d8c87f7f18cb48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/94ebfe05c900f8d6c0d0d75c55d4d4aa581be453","head":{"label":"apache:exunit","ref":"exunit","sha":"94ebfe05c900f8d6c0d0d75c55d4d4aa581be453","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nOriginally we posited that duplicate UUIDs could never be created.\r\nHowever due to operations interventions its possible to unintentionally\r\ncopy UUIDs in ways that violate this assumption. Instead of crashing the\r\nprocess we just reset the seq to zero and log a warning as was done in\r\nthe other instances when we have mismatches in the epoch history.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit apps=couch suites=couch_db`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation

JENKINS-46277 and JENKINS-47106 got fixed, the Jenkinsfile can\r\nbe made much simpler and more readable since we are able to use docker\r\nagents directly now.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n* We now have an ARM64 build ready to go.\r\n  * It's currently failing some couch_btree tests with timeouts.\r\n    I've seen these failures on x86_64, though.\r\n\r\n* If any one of the builds fails, Jenkins now kills all the rest.\r\n  This is useful because, in Jenkins, you can currently only\r\n  restart an entire pipeline stage, not just a single entry in the\r\n  pipeline. So there's no point in not killing the build fast, for\r\n  now. You can see which build actually failed by clicking through each\r\n  parallel stage and looking for a failed build step.\r\n\r\n* We're trying to save space on the drives:\r\n  * We now only keep the last 10 builds and their artifacts around.\r\n  * We also forcibly clean up our temp directories after any build.\r\n\r\n* Build's a bit faster since we're no longer multiply checking out\r\n  the source code for each parallel build.\r\n\r\n* Improved stage naming.\r\n\r\n* Formatting is all nice nice.\r\n\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/CouchDB/detail/jenkins-arm64-trusty/10/pipeline is the latest build attempt, which (just like master) is failing and there's nothing we can do about it for now.","created_at":"2019-05-03T03:03:17Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T18:45:32Z","closed_at":"2019-05-03T18:45:29Z","merged_at":"2019-05-03T18:45:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"af26397f477e87228cfebd0c8fc583561daaf2e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/2c6165961005533c800f7bd5294cf8529242baac","head":{"label":"apache:jenkins-arm64-trusty","ref":"jenkins-arm64-trusty","sha":"2c6165961005533c800f7bd5294cf8529242baac","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

IOQ2 Improvements\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IOQ system provides a way to prioritize a variety of request types such that\r\nstandard database operations can be run in parallel to background operations\r\nwithout negative impact. IOQ also provides some levers to change\r\nprioritization of request types on the fly, so that you can prioritize view\r\nbuilds or compactions. IOQ1 was a single Erlang server pid that all requests\r\nfunneled through, which given the rise in CPU cores and SSD hard drives, quickly\r\nbecomes a fundamental bottleneck of CouchDB.\r\n\r\nIOQ2 improves the situation by adding parallelism and faster data structures.\r\nYou can find more details about IOQ2 in [1]. With the increased parallelism, the\r\nchallenge becomes how do we dispatch requests across a pool of processes? The\r\nsimple case of round robin or random uniform distribution will do a good job of\r\ndistributing the load across the pool of processes, but it does not group\r\nrequests together in a beneficial way. This lack of grouping is problematic\r\nbecause it minimizes the amount of \"deduping\" we can do of identical requests,\r\nand it also greatly complicates prioritization of requests to an individual\r\ndatabase shard.\r\n\r\nDeduping is very important because it results in identical in flight read\r\nrequests to only be performed once, and the result is returned to all waiting\r\nreaders.  This is especially useful for inner b-tree nodes and can have a\r\nsubstantial impact on improving performance, reducing couch file overload, and\r\nreducing IO operations.\r\n\r\nThe other big reason to group requests together that are for the same couch\r\nfile, is that it allows us to prioritize those requests in concert. When we\r\ndispatch requests to a single couch file pid across a pool of IOQ pids, that\r\nmeans we can't prioritize those requests as a whole because prioritization\r\nhappens at the IOQ2 pid level, not at a global level.\r\n\r\nThis means that ideally we want to be dispatching all requests for an individual\r\ncouch file through a single IOQ2 pid. This is exactly what the `fd_hash`\r\ndispatch strategy does, where it takes a hash of the couch file pid modulo the\r\nnumber of IOQ2 pids, so that all requests to a particular couch file go through\r\nthe same IOQ2 pid. The problem with this approach is that you can have multiple\r\nheavily active couch file pids funneling through the same IOQ2 pid while other\r\nIOQ2 pids are idle. This is problematic because eventually IOQ2 pids will become\r\nbottlenecked (on metrics collection amusingly enough), and also because there is\r\ncurrently no couch file concurrency control within IOQ2 pids, so heavily active\r\ncouch files can starve requests to other couch files.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new approach to dispatching requests across IOQ2 pids.\r\nInstead of having a fixed pool of IOQ2 pids to dispatch requests across, this PR\r\nintroduces an `ioq_opener` process responsible for dynamically spawning IOQ2\r\npids as appropriate, with configuration options for grouping requests by shard,\r\nuser, db, or even request class. The result is a dedicated IOQ2 pid per group so\r\nall of the related requests are funneling through the same IOQ2 pid which allows\r\nfor deduping of requests and appropriate prioritization.\r\n\r\n# Current Status\r\n\r\nThis is currently a draft PR and provides a proof of concept implementation of\r\nthe IOQ opener logic, and it also demonstrates a few approaches taken over the\r\ncourse of iterating through this. The work is spread out across two repos, first\r\nin the CouchDB repo [2] and second in the CouchDB IOQ repo [3]. Because the\r\ncommits have been structured to illustrate different ideas and approaches, I'll\r\nlink out to individual commits rather than comparing the branches as a whole.\r\n\r\n## Initial Approach\r\n\r\nMy initial approach was to hook the IOQ opener logic into the places that open\r\nthe .couch file handles. My thought was that by fetching the appropriate IOQ pid\r\nwhen the database handle was opened, that all clients of that database would be\r\nable to utilize that pid without needing to look it back open. So the approach\r\nwas to ensure an IOQ pid was set _prior_ to storing the db reference in\r\n`couch_server` such that all clients getting a db handle out of `couch_server`\r\nalso get a handle to the appropriate IOQ pid. This works _ok_ in the simple\r\ncases, but starts to get complicated in a hurry.\r\n\r\nFirst off, view handles don't go through `couch_server`, so similar opener logic\r\nneeds to be implemented for views and other places. Second, with the Pluggable\r\nStorage Engines, the use of `couch_file` for the storage engine is an\r\nimplementation detail and no longer guaranteed, yet views do not support PSEs so\r\nwe have an awkward mix of an indirection layer around `couch_file`'s in primary\r\ndatabase operations and not in views. This is awkward because we need to key the\r\nIOQ pid on the `couch_file` pid so that all IOQ requests to the relevant\r\n`couch_file` go through the same IOQ pid, but the actual `couch_file` pid is\r\nhidden behind the PSE abstraction. This wasn't too hard to work around and I\r\nadded a `get_fd_pid` to the PSE implementation to support extracting it, but\r\ngiven we have to do similar types of things in `couch_server`,\r\n`couch_bt_engine_compactor`, `couch_db_updater`, `couch_mrview_updater`, etc, it\r\nseems like this is not an ideal approach.\r\n\r\nYou can see a rough version of this approach in the CouchDB repo at [4] and the\r\ncorresponding changes in the IOQ repo at [5].\r\n\r\n## Lazy Opener Approach\r\n\r\nI quickly became dissatisfied with the initial approach, especially with the\r\ndichotomy around `couch_file` interactions with some hidden behind PSE and\r\nothers hardcoded to use `couch_file` directly. I also didn't like how spread out\r\nthe setting of IOQ pids was and the requirement that all future uses of\r\n`couch_file` pids would need to properly set the pids as well.\r\n\r\nI started working on a lazy opener approach where we don't open the IOQ pid\r\nuntil we're in `ioq:call` and we conclude an appropriate IOQ pid has not yet\r\nbeen opened. That pid is then set in the pdict of the caller pid so that further\r\nIOQ calls to that fd will utilize the pre-determined IOQ pid. This approach\r\nseems natural, but it has its own set of awkwardness as we're only guaranteed to\r\nhave the fd pid when we're in `ioq:call`, which means that we can't easily\r\ndetermine the database name from the pid alone. I experimented with a hybrid\r\napproach that would do an initial opener logic when the database handle was\r\nopened and store a reference to the IOQ pid keyed off the fd in the `ioq_opener`\r\nwith the idea that we can then just lazily look up the appropriate IOQ pid based\r\non the fd at `ioq:call` time, which worked _ok_ but I was not a fan of sometimes\r\npresetting the IOQ pid and other times not.\r\n\r\nMy next iteration on this approach was to switch to using the `#ioq_request{}`\r\nrecord as the lookup value to `ioq_opener` rather than the fd or db name. This\r\nrequest record _should_ contain the appropriate shard name and IOQ class and\r\nother relevant information we would want to use for dispatching across IOQ pids.\r\nYou can see the combination of these two approaches in [6].\r\n\r\nThe tricky bit here being the part where we *should* have the appropriate shard\r\nname and other information. The problem is that this information is extracted\r\nfrom the `io_priority` parameter to `ioq:call`, which, if set, contains the\r\nshard name, however there is no fixed requirement that `io_priority` is set,\r\nwhich means there are a number of places that don't set an appropriate IOQ\r\npriority and just use the default values. There's no reason to ever not want an\r\nappropriate `io_priority` set, so this seems like an opportune time to finally\r\nrectify the lack of `io_priority` values. To do that, I added temporary measures\r\nto explode loudly when an IOQ request was missing an `io_priority` value. You\r\ncan see those changes for CouchDB and IOQ in [7] and [8], respectively.\r\n\r\nSo the next step was to set `io_priority` in all the places that it was not\r\nappropriately set. I accomplished this by adding the explode loudly changes\r\nabove and then running the test suite to trigger explosions. I've updated all\r\nof the missing `io_priority` locations with appropriate values in [9]. It's\r\nworth noting that this is not a guaranteed exhaustive list as this is a run time\r\ncheck and the run time was only exercised as efficiently as the eunit test suite\r\nexercises it. It would surprise me if there are not a few other corner cases\r\nwhere `io_priority` is not properly set.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the eunit test suite almost entirely ignores setting\r\n`io_priority` values and relies on not setting the priority being an acceptable\r\ncourse of action. If we're going to ensure that `io_priority` is set, then we\r\nneed to make sure it's set in the test suite as well. The somewhat arduous\r\ncommit to set `io_priority` throughout all the test suites is in [10]. I think\r\nwe can simplify that with some logic and utilities around setting `io_priority`\r\nin the test suites, but [10] does the initial leg work and sets it manually\r\neverywhere it needs to be set so that the test suite passes. Figuring out what\r\nto do on that front is one of the primary questions to be answered as part of\r\nthis work, but I think we would benefit considerably from a more rigorous\r\napproach to `io_priority` so I took the time to make it work initially so we can\r\nget a view of what it entails.\r\n\r\nThe changes in these two branches result in a proof of concept version of the\r\n`ioq_opener` logic that lazily assigns the IOQ pids as needed, based on the\r\ndimensions extracted for the `#ioq_request{}`, ensures that `io_priority` is\r\nalways set, and that the test suite passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n# IOQ Pid Eviction\r\n\r\nIf we're going to be dynamically spawning IOQ pids as needed, we need some\r\nmechanism to determine when to clear those processes out. The approach taken\r\nhere is basically reference counting clients to those pids. So the `ioq_opener`\r\nprocess will monitor the `couch_file` pids, view pids, compaction pids, client\r\npids, etc, and when all the relevant pids using that IOQ pid exit, then the IOQ\r\npid exits as well.\r\n\r\n# What is shared per pid?\r\n\r\nOne question is how many different client types should funnel through the same IOQ\r\npid? For instance, when we have a `couch_file` pid for a particular database\r\nshard, and we have corresponding view pids for that database shard, should they\r\nall go through the same IOQ pid? I believe they should, as otherwise we can't\r\nactually prioritize interactive database requests versus compaction/views/etc,\r\nso essentially the IOQ pid should be determined by database shard, not\r\nnecessarily the exact file that is currently being interacted with. Although\r\nthere are a few different dispatch strategies, one of which being fd pid based\r\ndispatch so you _can_ run an IOQ pid per `couch_file` if so desired. You can see\r\nthe dispatch logic in [11].\r\n\r\n# Status\r\n\r\nThis currently works and passes the test suite, although I want to add\r\n`ioq_opener` specific tests to ensure the eviction and dispatch logic is\r\nproperly functioning. There's some inconsistencies with shard names flying around\r\nthat need to be resolved to ensure all requests goto the appropriate IOQ pid.\r\nThe IOQ config settings also need to be updated to allow per IOQ pid config\r\nvalues. This is a great feature and will allow per shard concurrency levels and\r\npriority values for classes.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n[1]

Overview\r\n\r\nWe define a database's external size as:\r\n> Number of bytes that would be required to represent the contents outside of the database (for capacity and backup planning)\r\n\r\nGiven that we are using JSON as a data serialization format on REST API I assume that `external` should represent a size of uncompressed JSON serialized data.\r\n\r\nHowever we are using `?term_size` for calculating doc's sizes and that gives this definition of `external` a noticeable overhead.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo:\r\n```bash\r\n# movies.json contents a simplified imdb's movies info, i.e. reasonably complex json structure\r\n$ cat movies.json | jq .docs[2000]\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"The Love Light\",\r\n  \"year\": 1921,\r\n  \"cast\": [\r\n    \"Mary Pickford\",\r\n    \"Raymond Bloomer\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"genres\": [\r\n    \"Drama\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n$ stat -f%z movies.json \r\n3386172 \r\n\r\n$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/test -G -d n=1 q=1\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n\r\n$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/_bulk_docs --data @movies.json > /dev/null\r\n\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/test | jq .sizes.external\r\n5856324\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `external` here gives ~58% overhead over \"pure\" JSON data.\r\n\r\nI've switched from `?term_size` to `couch_ejson_size:encoded_size/1` for calculating external size and this returns much closer values. For the same test:\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/test | jq .sizes.external\r\n3357139\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother change is a switch from recalculation of external size during compaction to carrying it from leaf's info, so `external` size doesn't change after compaction:\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/_compact\r\n{\"ok\":true}\r\n$ curl http://127.0.0.1:15984/test | jq .sizes.external\r\n3357139\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAll the existing `couch` app's test should pass. The manual test could be done following the steps in the example above.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-18T16:32:40Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T11:44:57Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T11:44:53Z","merged_at":"2019-03-29T11:44:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"3227e61ebbe6ee15d122036ec85b57ebffeb062d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/4f31cdce5dd078e7699739fdc65979c8cd935f1e","head":{"label":"cloudant:fix-external-docs-size","ref":"fix-external-docs-size","sha":"4f31cdce5dd078e7699739fdc65979c8cd935f1e","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

PR implements shard splitting [1] for CouchDB as discussed in RFC #1920.\r\n\r\nThe work is organized as a series of commits in the following order:\r\n\r\n* Uneven shard copy handling in mem3 and fabric. That's a preparatory step to\r\n  make sure mem3 and fabric knows how to handle uneven shard copies on the\r\n  cluster.\r\n\r\n* Main job manager and supervisor. This commit defines the supervision tree and\r\n  the main job manager. The job manager is a central component which starts,\r\n  stops and monitors jobs.\r\n\r\n* Individual shard splitting job implementation and associated helper module.\r\n  Here the logic for a single shard splitting job is defined along with the\r\n  needed helpers, some of which were separated in different modules. The\r\n  couch_db_split module, specifically is in its own commit as it lives in the\r\n  `couch` application, operates on db files (instead of shards) and general is\r\n  large and separate enough from the rest to warrant its own commit.\r\n\r\n* Internal replicator update to handle split shards. Internal replicator and\r\n  some associated helpers in mem3_rep were updated to handle split shard\r\n  sources and targets. Internal replicator involved in resharding in two main\r\n  ways 1) during the normal cluster operation replicating between possibly\r\n  split shards and 2) as part of the shard splitting job logic where it is used\r\n  to topoff updates from the source to the targets.\r\n\r\n* HTTP API implementation and functional tests. This commit implements the HTTP\r\n  API and adds behavior and other tests as discussed in the RFC.\r\n\r\n[1] Shard splitting and resharding is used interchangeably in the PR and the\r\ncommits. Initially the work had started with implementing just shard splitting\r\nand the API reflected that, however after a fruitful discussion in the couchdb\r\ndev mailing list, it was agreed to generalize the work to potentially allow\r\nshard merging or other shard map operations in the future. So closer to the\r\nHTTP API level \"resharding\" will be used more often and in the job\r\nimplementation discussions and comments shard splitting will be used, since\r\ncurrently only shard splitting is supported.\r\n\r\n[Opened a new PR as the original #1921 seems to have gotten unsynchronized with Travis-CI where it was not building the correct commits anymore]\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T04:56:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T14:48:49Z","closed_at":"2019-04-03T14:48:46Z","merged_at":"2019-04-03T14:48:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6db7d54e7651eee796932a60b534b208566f563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/64bc9417cac092bb20fbdb76a830dcca60d2f13d","head":{"label":"apache:reshard","ref":"reshard","sha":"64bc9417cac092bb20fbdb76a830dcca60d2f13d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThe mango sort error can be a bit confusing with using a partitioned\r\ndatabase this gives a little more detail on why mango could not find\r\na specific index when a sort is used.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nElixir and python mango tests should pass. Create a partitioned database, have a selector that has a sort in it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselector = %{\r\n      selector: %{\r\n        some: \"field\"\r\n      },\r\n      sort: [\"some\"],\r\n      limit: 50\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get back different errors depending on a normal database, partitioned database with a partitioned query or a global query on a partitioned database.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

this test used to fail on Windows, possibly to due to a full restart\r\nof the chttp and mochiweb applications. It turns out chttpd monitors config\r\nchanges and restarts the listner if there any change which affect the listening\r\nsocket. One issue with this approach is that restart intensity is limited to 3\r\ntimes in 10 seconds. To avoid this usue, some redundant tests were removed. The\r\nthree tests which are left should cover the same functionality as before,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n 1) In the default case, a large enough (7KB) url and header should be parsed.\r\n\r\n 2) Manually setting `buffer` works and will reduce the maximum header line\r\n length and then the server should return a 400 error.\r\n\r\n 3) Setting `recbuf` also sets the user land `buffer` value as well with the\r\n same effect as 2).\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-03T23:06:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T04:57:52Z","closed_at":"2019-03-05T22:42:21Z","merged_at":"2019-03-05T22:42:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"c298091a4ce6a211208ae0e13e760a69d51d79a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d88277ff7f954aaab4dfd6556d0b55b1b88059a9","head":{"label":"apache:fix-chttpd-socket-buffer-size-test-2.3.x","ref":"fix-chttpd-socket-buffer-size-test-2.3.x","sha":"d88277ff7f954aaab4dfd6556d0b55b1b88059a9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

this test used to fail on Windows, possibly to due to a full restart\r\nof the chttp and mochiweb applications. It turns out chttpd monitors config\r\nchanges and restarts the listner if there any change which affect the listening\r\nsocket. One issue with this approach is that restart intensity is limited to 3\r\ntimes in 10 seconds. To avoid this usue, some redundant tests were removed. The\r\nthree tests which are left should cover the same functionality as before,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n 1) In the default case, a large enough (7KB) url and header should be parsed.\r\n\r\n 2) Manually setting `buffer` works and will reduce the maximum header line\r\n length and then the server should return a 400 error.\r\n\r\n 3) Setting `recbuf` also sets the user land `buffer` value as well with the\r\n same effect as 2).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-03T22:58:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T01:54:39Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T01:54:36Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T01:54:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"a36ec91e0542a153fead1f0c5224fed5b80d039d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b0b765da70a92994b92ebadab1a110793f389c36","head":{"label":"apache:fix-chttpd-socket-buffer-size-test","ref":"fix-chttpd-socket-buffer-size-test","sha":"b0b765da70a92994b92ebadab1a110793f389c36","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
