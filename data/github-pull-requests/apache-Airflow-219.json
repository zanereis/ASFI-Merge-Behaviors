Kerberos sidecar support\r\n\r\nSome of the users of Airflow are using Kerberos to authenticate\r\ntheir worker workflows. Airflow has a basic support for Kerberos\r\nfor some of the operators and it has support to refresh the\r\ntemporary kerberos tokens via `airflow kerberos` command.\r\n\r\nThis change adds support for the Kerberos side-car that connects\r\nto the Kerberos Key Distribution Center and retrieves the\r\ntoken using Keytab that should be deployed as Kubernetes Secret.\r\n\r\nIt uses shared volume to share the temporary token. The nice\r\nthing about setting it up as a sidecar is that the Keytab\r\nis never shared with the workers - the secret is only mounted\r\nby the sidecar and the workers have only access to the temporary\r\ntoken.\r\n\r\nDepends on #11129\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal

PR is cherry-picked from #10153. It makes `TaskGroup` work with v1-10-test so that we can encourage more people to start using `TaskGroup`.\r\n(`TaskMixin` was also cherry-picked from #10930).\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n- Only `www_rbac/views.py` and `graph.html` works with `TaskGroup`. So users will only be use TaskGroup in Graph View if they have `rbac = True` under  `[webserver]` in `airflow.cfg`. This is because `www/views.py` and graph.html has too many differences against the master branch, making it hard to merge. If `TaskGroup` is used in DAGs but the webserver is not rbac, the Graph View will not break, it'll just appear like `TaskGroup` was never used. All tasks will appear on the original DAG normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the original commit message in #10153:\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `TaskGroup`, which is a simple UI task grouping concept. \r\n\r\nWhat this PR does:\r\n- TaskGroups can be collapsed/expanded in Graph View when clicked\r\n- TaskGroups can be nested\r\n- TaskGroups can be put upstream/downstream of tasks or other TaskGroups with `>>` and `<<` operators\r\n- Search box, hovering, focusing in Graph View treats TaskGroup properly. E.g. searching for tasks also highlights TaskGroup that contains matching task_id. When TaskGroup is expanded/collapsed, the affected TaskGroup is put in focus and moved to the centre of the graph.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does not do:\r\n- This PR does not change or remove `SubDagOperator`. Although `TaskGroup` is intended as an alternative for `SubDagOperator`, deprecating `SubDagOperator` will need to be discussed/implemented in the future.\r\n- This PR only implemented `TaskGroup` handling in the Graph View. In places such as Tree View, it will look like as-if `TaskGroup` does not exist and all tasks are in the same flat DAG.\r\n\r\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8078\r\nAIP: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-34+TaskGroup%3A+A+UI+task+grouping+concept+as+an+alternative+to+SubDagOperator\r\n\r\nThis is the example_task_group that this PR

is my second attempt to submit a request to add the GreatExpectationsBigQueryOperator to Airflow. There were some problems with my first attempt.  \r\n\r\nI'm probably bending protocol a bit because this is what I call a 'preliminary' pull request. Before going to the effort of writing the tests for the new operator and submitting a more refined pull request, I need feedback about the viability of this operator being accepted into Airflow and any other major flaws I need to address.\r\n\r\nI'll start with some background. What is Great Expectations(GE)? It's an open source python project that automates data QA testing and data profiling. A user's data '[expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/reference/glossary_of_expectations.html)' can be laid out in a json file and GE will check those expectations against a table or query result by firing off a series of SQL queries. Results of the checks are output in json and html files. I've created a [short video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PPHgCySA6iprVSWz5) to explain how GE and the operator work.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for any feedback I can get but I have three immediate questions:\r\n1. Does this sound like a contribution that would be accepted into Airflow?\r\n2. Is there any special testing that needs to be done because the operator imports parts of the great-expectations package (version 0.12.1), which has never been used before in Airflow?\r\n3. Is it a problem that the operator connects to BigQuery in a somewhat unusual way compared with other operators? The operator takes a BigQuery connection as a parameter but the actual connection to BigQuery is made inside of the GE code. Therefore, the operator pulls some connection info from the hook but just passes that information to GE so it can make the connection.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrian\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-24T00:11:30Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T20:13:59Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T20:13:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79c49ac53143457adee032ac4ff2f5dd91c0cbb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

is a request to add the GreatExpectationsBigQueryOperator to Airflow.  I'm probably bending protocol a bit because this is what I call a 'preliminary' pull request.  Before going to the effort of writing the tests for the new operator and submitting a more refined pull request, I need feedback about the viability of this operator being accepted into Airflow and any other major flaws I need to address.\r\n\r\nI'll start with some background.  What is Great Expectations(GE)?  It's an open source python project that automates data QA testing and data profiling.  A user's data '[expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/reference/glossary_of_expectations.html)' can be laid out in a json file and GE will check those expectations against a table or query result by firing off a series of SQL queries.  Results of the checks are output in json and html files.  I've created a [short video](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PPHgCySA6iprVSWz5) to explain how GE and the operator work.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for any feedback I can get but I have three immediate questions:\r\n1. Does this sound like a contribution that would be accepted into Airflow?\r\n2. Is there any special testing that needs to be done because the operator imports parts of the great expectations package, which has never been used before in Airflow?\r\n3. Is it a problem that the operator connects to BigQuery in a somewhat unusual way compared with other operators?  The operator takes a BigQuery connection as a parameter but the actual connection to BigQuery is made inside of the GE code.  Therefore, the operator pulls some connection info from the hook but just passes that information to GE so it can make the connection.\r\n\r\nOh, and I reformatted the file in Pycharm so that's probably why there are more file differences compared with the previous version.  The real changes I made are:\r\n1.  to the imports\r\n2. Added the [new operator code](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9a77b56d85aae295d220d619f363df2d585f42f2/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L2132) to the bottom of the file.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrian","created_at":"2020-09-23T21:17:13Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T14:58:02Z","closed_at":"2020-09-23T23:19:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb42789d6c2335e2dc08bb1ad3288ba58b0d3f23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

The [contents that it yields today](https://r.hmlt.in/YEuo581n) is largely redundant with the DAG Details view or is data not particularly relevant to the end user. I've added a couple of properties to the DAG Details to reconcile the removal.\r\n\r\n- Added \"Parent DAG\" to conditionally display on DAG Details when DAG is a Sub-DAG. This DAG ID is a link back to the parent DAG.\r\n- Added the \"Tags\" for a given DAG on DAG Details. Each tag is a link to the DAGs (home) view with the results filtered by that tag.\r\n- ~Removed the `DagModelView` class, but relocated its `autocomplete` method being used by the DAGs (home) view.

introduced deletion of the old artifacts as this was a\r\nsuspected culprit of Kubernetes Job failures. It turned out\r\neventually that those Kubernetes Job failures were caused by\r\nthe #11017 change, but it's good to do housekeeping of the\r\nartifacts anyway.\r\n\r\nThe delete workflow action introduced in a hurry had two problems:\r\n\r\n* it runs for every fork if they sync master. This is a bit\r\n  too invasive\r\n\r\n* it fails continuously after 10 - 30 minutes every time\r\n  as we have too many old artifacts to delete (GitHub has\r\n  90 days retention policy so we have likely tens of\r\n  thousands of artifacts to delete)\r\n\r\n* it runs every hour and it causes occasional API rate limit\r\n  exhaution (because we have too many artifacts to loop trough)\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces filtering with the repo, changes frequency\r\nof deletion to be 4 times a day and adds script that we are\r\nrunning manualy to delete those excessive artifacts now. Eventually\r\nwhen the number of artifacts goes down the regular job shoul delete\r\nmaybe few hundreds of artifacts appearing within the 6 hours window\r\nand it should stop failing.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)**

automatically Airflow with --start-airflow made me realize the necessity to run some additional commands to complete the setup of my development or testing environment: using variables.env was not nice, but also it was wrong, because that file is sourced before --start-airflow initialize the db (so no way to create a connection or a pool before the database is up).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I gave Airflow the possibility to run an init script (`init.sh`) from `files/airflow-breeze-config`. The flag `--init-script` is added as commodity to change the name of the script (the folder should stay the same).\r\n\r\nThe init script is executed after the environment is setup, but before other command (like the `exec` command or tests). The only exception is the `--start-airflow` flag, in this case the script is executed after the db initialization, but before the tmux session is created.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

apache/airflow#10953\r\n\r\nReplaces the PNG + HTML text version of the Airflow logo with an SVG that yields both the pinwheel and \"Airflow\" text. The prior implementation simply used the default font-family (Helvetica Neue) for the brand name, where this implementation uses the [brand font-family](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Brandbook) (Rubik). This ensures that brand font is always locked up with the logo in cases where an end-user may apply a custom theme (e.g. different default font-family). \r\n\r\nI left the old static asset (`pin_100.png`) in the file system as it appears to still be [in use by a Slack Operator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/slack/operators/slack.py#L134).\r\n\r\nIf you stare long enough, you'll see the typography differences 😃\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93630619-4844f980-f9b8-11ea-82fc-6d09072bd54e.png)  |  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/93630461-16339780-f9b8-11ea-889d-402fa170381c.png)|\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

can have *extremely* bad consequences. After this change, a jinja2 template like the one below will cause the task instance to fail, if the DAG being executed is not a sub-DAG. This may also display an error on the Rendered tab of the Task Instance page.\r\n\r\n`task_instance.xcom_pull('z', key='return_value', dag_id=dag.parent_dag.dag_id)`\r\n\r\nPrior to the change in this commit, the above template would pull the latest value for task_id 'z', for the given execution_date, from *any DAG*. If your task_ids between DAGs are all unique, or if DAGs using the same task_id always have different execution_date values, this will appear to act like dag_id=None.\r\n\r\nOur current theory is SQLAlchemy/Python doesn't behave as expected when comparing `jinja2.Undefined` to `None`.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly this issue boils down to PEBKAC, but this is also a case of Airflow not doing the (perceived) right thing in the face of ambiguity, and this PR fixes that up.\r\n\r\nI did find this note about why it was only set to `jinja2.Undefined`, but given the way this can fail (and the difficulty in tracking down the root cause), I strongly feel this warrants breaking backwards compatibility with DAGs/task instances that are attempting to erroneously use undefined variables.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4951#discussion_r268411345","created_at":"2020-09-18T16:52:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T20:38:12Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T07:15:29Z","merged_at":"2020-09-25T07:15:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"37798f0d2a91eeaca5e816b63beac44d3c0898aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/11016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/11016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/11016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6a3b3fd98afc98ce17fc671dadda36c4c8729649","head":{"label":"lattwood:switch_to_strict_undefined","ref":"switch_to_strict_undefined","sha":"6a3b3fd98afc98ce17fc671dadda36c4c8729649","user":{"login":"lattwood","id":6198952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTg5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6198952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood","html_url":"https://github.com/lattwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":296674639,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTY2NzQ2Mzk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"lattwood/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lattwood","id":6198952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTg5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6198952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood","html_url":"https://github.com/lattwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lattwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lattwood/airflow","description":"Apache

is cherry-picked from  #4751 for `v1-10-test`.\r\n\r\nSome investigation into the issue reported in #10790 led to the discovery that this loop in `scheduler_job.py` takes almost 90% of the time in `SchedulerJob.process_file()` for large DAGs (around 500 tasks). This causes the `DagFileProcessor` spawned by the scheduler to go slowly. The reason this loop is slow is that it creates a new `DepContext` for every `ti`. And every `DepContext` needs to populate its own `finished_tasks` even though this list is the same for every `DagRun`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            for ti in tis:\r\n                task = dag.get_task(ti.task_id)\r\n\r\n                # fixme: ti.task is transient but needs to be set\r\n                ti.task = task\r\n\r\n                if ti.are_dependencies_met(\r\n                        dep_context=DepContext(flag_upstream_failed=True),\r\n                        session=session):\r\n                    self.log.debug('Queuing task: %s', ti)\r\n                    task_instances_list.append(ti.key)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the flamegraph generated by `py-spy` showing the performance of `DagFileProcessor` in Airflow 1.10.12 before this PR:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuqian90/airflow/gif_for_demo/airflow/www/static/flamegraph_before.svg\r\n\r\nThis is the performance after 1.10.12 is patched with this PR:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuqian90/airflow/gif_for_demo/airflow/www/static/flamegraph_after.svg\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is that #4751 already addressed this issue for master branch. We just need to cherry-pick it to fix this in 1.10.* with some very minor conflict fixes.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR will not fix every scenario that causes #10790, it does reduce the `DagFileProcessor` time from around 100s to just about 12s for our use case (a DAG with about 500 tasks, many of them are sensors in `reschedule` mode with `poke_interval` 60s.). \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal commit message in #4751:\r\n\r\nThis decreases scheduler delay between tasks by about 20% for larger DAGs,\r\nsometimes more for larger or more complex DAGs.\r\n\r\nThe delay between tasks can be a major issue, especially when we have dags with\r\nmany subdags, figures out that the scheduling process spends plenty of time in\r\ndependency checking, we took the trigger rule dependency which calls the db for\r\neach task instance, we made it call the db just once for each dag_run\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

these PR I would like to add a new Mesos Executor as replacement of the deprecated one. \r\n\r\n## Why a new Mesos Executor\r\n\r\nThere are still companies outside they want to use Airflow with there Mesos infrastructure. But your Mesos Executor is deprecated and already removed in Version 2.0.0. Also, the code is based on a python3 incompatible (and deprecated) mesos library. Thats why I decide to develop a new Mesos Executor.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis Mesos Executor need the following python libs:\r\n\r\n- mesos.interface\r\n- avmesos\r\n\r\nYou can install them via `pip install`!\r\n\r\n## Automation Tests\r\n\r\nI was using https://github.com/irvinlim/mesosmock as mesos mockup server for the automation tests.\r\n\r\n## My offer to you\r\n\r\nIt would also be my pleasure to maintain the Mesos Executor. :-) With some changes, the new Mesos Executor is even working under Airflow 1.10.x.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-16T16:09:09Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T00:03:29Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T00:03:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"098cc3b66ef68a376305a1d3deae7509023f1bb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR is a conversation piece that came from pondering how to support import error alert emails in #10968.\r\nThis is a feature will be especially useful for admins who use `ClusterPolicyViolation` or those who have pesky folks that push bad DAGs cluttering the UI with notifications that should be triaged to the on-call w/o human intervention.\r\n\r\nI believe that the `import_errors` is a sad place in the airflow codebase and now might be the time to refactor this.\r\nI've left TODO comments with questions about how to best keep track of import_error emails we have sent (as to not spam the recipients with emails every scheduler loop).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me we can either keep history of import errors in the existing table or create a new table (e.g. `import_error_history` which has a bool field for email_sent) for this purpose.\r\n\r\ncc: @mik-laj
