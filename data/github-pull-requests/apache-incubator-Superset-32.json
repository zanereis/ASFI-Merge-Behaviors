For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher.

There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin‚Äôs excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there‚Äôs a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>‚Ä¶ and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher.

[supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster) from 4.1.1 to 8.0.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/releases\">supercluster's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v8.0.1</h2>\n<p>Fix an error when creating an empty index (after <code>load([])</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/225\">#225</a></p>\n<h2>v8.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>‚ö° Drastically <strong>reduce memory footprint</strong> (by up to 60%) and <strong>improve clustering performance</strong> by ~15-20%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/223\">#223</a></li>\n<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking: drop CommonJS entry point and switch to <strong>ESM only</strong> for Node &amp; bundlers + UMD bundle for browsers.</li>\n<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking: <strong>drop support for IE11</strong> (you can still transpile on your end to keep it).</li>\n<li>Upgrade <code>kdbush</code> dependency to v4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v7.1.5</h2>\n<p>Fix handling of non-integer zoom values in methods like <code>getClusters()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/199\">#199</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.4</h2>\n<p>Avoid creating new objects for same clusters across zooms, improving memory footprint and making sure the same clusters have the same <code>cluster_id</code> across zoom levels. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/190\">#190</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.3</h2>\n<p>Fix a bug where coordinates of unclustered points were snapping to a grid on higher zoom levels. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/176\">#176</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.2</h2>\n<p>Fix <code>fround</code> fallback on IE11 so that the  v7.1.1 small radius bugfix is effective there too.</p>\n<h2>v7.1.1</h2>\n<p>Fix a bug where identical points sometimes wouldn't cluster on higher zooms given a small radius.</p>\n<h2>v7.1.0</h2>\n<p>Added <code>minPoints</code> option for the minimum number of points to form a cluster (<code>2</code> by default).</p>\n<h2>v7.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>generateId</code> option to generate numeric ids (<code>feature.id</code>) for input features that don't have it.</li>\n<li>‚ö†Ô∏è Possibly breaking: adjusted generated cluster id values to make sure there are no collisions when combined with <code>generateId</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v6.0.2</h2>\n<p>Slightly improved performance of <code>map</code>/<code>reduce</code> by avoiding redundant <code>map</code> calls. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/131\">#131</a></p>\n<h2>v6.0.1</h2>\n<p>Fixed a bug introduced in v6.0.0 where some aggregated cluster properties were calculated incorrectly.</p>\n<h2>v6.0.0</h2>\n<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Breaking:</strong> removed <code>initial</code> option of the map/reduce functionality. Now Supercluster uses the first mapped item of the cluster as the initial value:</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// before\nvalue = initial;\nreduce(value, a);\nreduce(value, b);\n...\n// after\nvalue = a;\nreduce(value, b);\n...\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `ParsedQuery.tables` property, so it works with more edge cases. It fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21535, covering some security issues. It makes use of `sqlglot`. I've tried a [different approach](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24032) in the past using `sqloxide` instead (since we already had it as an optional dependency), but `sqlglot` is a better dependency since it's pure Python, and people have had problems in the past to install `sqloxide` on arm systems.\r\n\r\nIn the future I think it would be nice to consider replacing our usage of `sqlparse` with `sqlglot`. (We might want to keep `sqloxide` as optional, like it currently is, for places where performance is crucial.) In this PR modified `ParsedQuery` to receive an optional `engine` parameter, so that it can leverage dialect-specific parsers. I think this offers a nice abstraction, since all the parser-dependent features live inside `ParsedQuery` now.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently docker ephemeral env (https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-ephemeral-env.yml) triggers when docker workflow finishes, this changes moves this step to when an actual committer requests for a docker env to be created. Both workflows triggers have `secrets` access but `issue_comment` uses current default branch commit SHA so it's no subject to PR changes and validates that only privilege users can execute this step.\r\n\r\nI was not able to properly test this change since it run with current master git SHA, so I expect that further changes may be needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI found a regression where we can longer filter databases by the UUID. While this functionality is not used by Superset, the [Preset CLI](https://github.com/preset-io/backend-sdk) relies on it (and is used not just with Preset workspaces, but with standalone Superset deployments for multiple reasons).\r\n\r\nThis PR brings back the functionality, and adds a unit test to prevent future breakage.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe `BigQueryEngineSpec` has `allows_hidden_cc_in_orderby` set to `True`, so the `ORDER BY` statement uses the actual metric/dimension alias, rather than its SQL expression (implementation PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17196).\r\n\r\nIn case the metric alias has a special characters (like accents or Chinese characters for example), the query will throw an error.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26459\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dataset from a BQ connection.\r\n2. Use it to create a **Table** chart.\r\n3. Add any column as its dimension, and create a metric named `m√©tric` using `COUNT(*)` as its SQL expression.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [X] Has associated issue:

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nEnhancing Accessibility with Unified Table Structure and Sticky Header\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses accessibility concerns by merging the header and body of our tables into a single unified structure. This change significantly improves screen reader compatibility, ensuring a more inclusive user experience. Previously, the header and body of a chart were seperate tables. Visually this worked but caused issues with screen reader functionality.\r\n\r\n**Key Change:**\r\n- The table now consists of a single, unified structure, as opposed to separate elements for the header and body. This enhances accessibility, particularly for screen reader users.\r\n- The header is made sticky using CSS, allowing it to remain visible while the table body is scrollable.\r\n\r\n**Technical Challenge:**\r\nA notable challenge was maintaining a scrollable body while keeping the header fixed. Setting overflow directly on **`tbody`** proved unfeasible. Wrapping **`tbody`** in a div with an overflow disrupted the column grouping, as the table would then interpret the entire **`tbody`** as a single column. The implemented solution achieves the desired layout without compromising the table's integrity or accessibility.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to a page featuring the modified table structure.\r\n2. Use a screen reader to ensure that the table content is read correctly and in a logical order and doesn't read end of table early.\r\n3. Scroll through the table to check that the header remains fixed while the body is scrollable.\r\n4. Visually inspect the table across different browsers for consistent rendering.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the [4.0 approved initiatives](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/292/views/1), this PR deprecates the `KV_STORE` feature flag and its related assets such as the API endpoint and `keyvalue` table. The main dependency of this feature is the `SHARE_QUERIES_VIA_KV_STORE` feature flag which allows sharing SQL Lab queries without the necessity of saving the query. Our intention is to use the permalink feature to implement this use case before 5.0 and that's why we are deprecating the feature flag now.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\npart two of the [context logs](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26418), this adds the chart and dataset ids to global context when the /data endpoints are called for use in the sql mutator.\r\n\r\nAn example of a sql_mutator override to log these values would be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef mutator(sql: str, **kwargs: Any) -> str:\r\n    key = \"6dcd92a04feb50f14bbcf07c661680ba\"\r\n    output = (\r\n        f\"-- {key}\\n\"\r\n        + f\"-- slice_id: {g.logs_context.get('slice_id') if hasattr(g,'logs_context') else ''}\\n\"\r\n        + f\"-- dataset_id:{g.logs_context.get('dataset_id') if hasattr(g,'logs_context') else ''}\\n\"\r\n    )\r\n    return output + f\"{sql}\\n-- {key}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhat if you could actually _measure_ various sources of technical debt, upon the merge of each PR? This PR is the start of being able to do so. We will be able to track different piles of work we care about over time, and generate actionable to-do lists for others to tackle.\r\n\r\nThis is a reboot of an antique branch/PR, for cleanliness. It does the following:\r\n* Adds a new eslintrc file that's custom-built to track/warn on technical debt metrics\r\n* Adds a custom eslint transformer that splits the eslint report into aggregated stats and individual offenses\r\n  * aggregated stats are added to one google sheet tab\r\n  * individual offenses are added to an eslint TODO tab in the same google sheet.\r\n* adds an npm script to run this\r\n* adds a github action to run the script on mergest to master\r\n\r\nThis PR just does this for Javascript - and only for a limited set of rules. We can do the same here for python, and other bits of code and content in our universe. Ultimately, we want to have this all in a nice visible dashboard for all to leverage in either tracking this debt, and/or contributing to its demise. Here's the humble beginning of such a dashboard, using these scripts:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/812905/e673f337-b3eb-4a41-bb21-8396e95650a3)\r\n\r\nOnce Apache adds the secret to the repo to write to GitHub actions, we should actually see this working. That ticket is open. This will run on merges to `master` or `main` so we can get ahead of that change.\r\n\r\nIn time, we can gather a lot more info here... and hopefully make this an example dashboard and a regular touch point of community engagement.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis is the first PR for https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26019 [SIP-109] Global logs context. \r\nIt introduces a decorator `logs_context` that will add permitted values to a global variable `logs_context` that can later be retrieved for logging information when a larger context is needed than what is available to the method that is calling the logging function. I included an example for slack notifications, but there are more examples in my POC/draft pr https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25920 that has more examples of how we can use this decorator.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdding Show/Hide Axis Controls to Bar charts.\r\nFor Bar charts or Line charts, if I add values to the bar or to the line, then I may not need to show the axis because it would interfere with the look and feel and would not be aesthetically pleasing, such as the following:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/28430952/5911c3ef-7fc8-41f2-af5d-6884737134e5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nCreate a Bar chart and click on the Y Axis in CUSTOMIZE and unfilter \"SHOW AXIS\" to hide the Y Axis (HORIZONTAL is the X Axis).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds the option to force a chart with a numerical x-axis to categorical. This makes it possible to sort charts that have a numerical x-axis, while still retaining support for numerical x-axis functionality. This should clear up a compatibility issue between previous versions of Superset, where some versions always treated numerical x-axes as categorical, while others always treated them as numerical.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this, I noticed that the Query based datasource was missing the generic data type information that's needed for charts to operate properly. I believe this should resolve some issues we've seen on charts that are using the SQL Lab query as the source.\r\n\r\nNote, that I tried to add similar support for temporal x-axes, but that turned out to be very difficult due to how we handle timestamp formats. Therefore, the force option will only be available when the x-axis is numerical, but not for temporal ones. For use cases where similar sorting is needed for temporal charts, I recommend just casting and formatting them to a string based type first.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow there's a new control that makes it possible to force numerical x-axes to categorical (disabled by default):\r\n<img width=\"1264\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/e8f85d0a-3ad7-417e-a8b4-87c689eba9cb\">\r\nNote, that if a sorting value had previously been defined, it will set this control to true by default. This is to ensure that charts that had been created on a previous version of Superset, where the x-axis was numeric but were treated as categorical, will work as they were originally intended.\r\n\r\nHere we can see that we're able to sort by the metric value if the chart is forced to categorical style:\r\n<img width=\"1263\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/6bafa99a-5b5b-4f67-ab13-f74d2147007b\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the sorting control was visible, but didn't do anything if the x-axis was numeric:\r\n<img width=\"1267\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/ee266996-e556-49f2-9a1b-651397bbdee1\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI have found that when attempting to swap the positions of metrics in the table chart with applied column configuration, the column configuration is switched to another column, which is related to the addition of #19841 for maintaining configurations when metrics are renamed. To address this issue, I have added a condition to first check if the column name is found in the old metrics. If it is found, it will avoid updating the column configuration. Reassignment will only occur if the new column name is not found among the existing ones to maintain configurations when metrics are renamed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before:** Currency prefix is switched to SUM(quantity_ordered)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/8f83aa5f-2794-4f9a-adfb-2085293dc0f2\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:** Currency prefix is applied to SUM(sales) as expected\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/e17f0ed8-5dff-482e-9797-4edb0bcdf8d7\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create a table chart with dimensions and two or more metrics. \r\n2. Apply number formatting to any of the metrics. \r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes the duplicated plugin registration that generates the following type of warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nItem with key \"deck_arc\" already exists. You are assigning a new value.\r\nItem with key \"deck_arc\" already exists. You are assigning a new value.\r\nItem with key \"big_number\" already exists. You are assigning a new value.\r\nItem with key \"box_plot\" already exists. You are assigning a new value.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe duplicate registration was necessary when those pages belonged to different React apps. Now, they belong to the same app which makes the registration unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe registration should happen only once when the [application

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the [4.0 approved initiatives](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/292/views/1), this PR removes the deprecated Redirect API that supported short URLs (`/r`) and the `url` metadata table used to store them that was used before the permalink feature. Users lost the ability to generate R links ~1.5 years ago which seems sufficient time to remove the endpoint. It looks like we forgot to officially deprecate the endpoint in `config.py` when working on 3.0 but https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19078 has the following message in `UPDATING.md` which is more relevant from a communication standpoint as opposed to the `# deprecated` comment in `config.py`:\r\n\r\n> - [19078](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19078): Creation of old shorturl links has been deprecated in favor of a new permalink feature that solves the long url problem (old shorturls will still work, though!). By default, new permalinks use UUID4 as the key. However, to use serial ids similar to the old shorturls, add the following to your `superset_config.py`: `PERMALINK_KEY_TYPE = \"id\"`.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient for merging this PR. We'll do a complete testing of 4.0 after all approved proposals are merged.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the [4.0 approved initiatives](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/292/views/1), this PR removes the Filters Set feature including the deprecated `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS_SET` feature flag and all related API endpoints. The feature is permanently removed as it was not being actively maintained, it was not widely used, and it was full of bugs. We also considered that if we were to provide a similar feature, it would be better to re-implement it from scratch given the amount of technical debt that the current implementation has.\r\n\r\nThe previous value of the feature flag was `False` and now the feature is permanently removed.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient for merging this PR. We'll do a complete testing of 4.0 after all approved proposals are merged.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSQLAlchemy doesn't strictly define what `get_indexes` method should do when table is not found.\r\nSome dialects return the empty list while some of them raise `NoSuchTableError`.\r\n\r\nWhen `NoSuchTableError` error is thrown, API returns 500 when non-existing table details are requested.\r\nThis PR fixes this issue and returns 404 in such cases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThere are some custom visualizations which allow to perform cross-filtration over multiple columns. In this case, current implementation of cross-filters tag does not display data correctly, since it shows only the first column name. For example, it can be seen in Pivot Table with multi-select. This fix allows to display all column names and corresponding values in the cross-filter tag.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/76280175/5d40f8a3-1f44-41d7-a2cb-28e7465b08e3)\r\nAfter:\r\n![–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/76280175/fe977f84-7422-46f6-93b8-62b0f7207265)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.
