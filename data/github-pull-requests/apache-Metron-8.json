Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nWith the creation of METRON-1378 we have the ability to create serialized summaries of data. We need to interact with these summaries from within Stellar. This enables use-cases like creating a bloom filter of malicious domains and interacting with that bloom filter from within all the places where stellar is available.\r\n\r\n## Manual Testing \r\nThis PR depends on #879 to create summarized objects for testing.  As such, the easiest way to manually test this is to actually go through the testing for #882.  #882 has the code here merged into it and will be kept up-to-date.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull

Contributor Comments\r\nWe have a nice and generalized infrastructure for loading data into HBase and interacting with it via `flatfile_loader.sh` and `ENRICHMENT_GET()`.  It is also useful to summarize a set of data into a static data structure, store it on HDFS and interact with it via stellar.  To this end, to complement the `flatfile_loader.sh`, we should have a `flatfile_summarizer.sh` that, using the same extractor config, will process a flat file and output a serialized object.\r\n\r\nThe usecase for this is as follows:\r\nLet's say that I have a static list of domains in the second column of a CSV, domains.csv, and I want to generate a bloom filter with those domains in them sans TLD.\r\n\r\nI should be able to create a file called `bloom.ser` with the serialized bloom filter given the extractor config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"config\" : {\r\n    \"columns\" : {\r\n       \"rank\" : 0,\r\n       \"domain\" : 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_transform\" : {\r\n       \"domain\" : \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD(domain)\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_filter\" : \"LENGTH(domain) > 0\",\r\n    \"state_init\" : \"BLOOM_INIT()\",\r\n    \"state_update\" : {\r\n       \"state\" : \"BLOOM_ADD(state, domain)\"\r\n                     },\r\n    \"state_merge\" : \"BLOOM_MERGE(states)\",\r\n    \"separator\" : \",\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"extractor\" : \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, the associated stellar function `OBJECT_GET` is available in #880.\r\n\r\n# Testing Plan\r\n\r\nWe should run the test plan for #445 to ensure no regressions since 80% of this PR is just refactoring existing abstractions to reuse.\r\n\r\n## Write out a String Locally\r\nWe are going to take the top 10k alexa domains (saved as part of #445 's test plan to `~/top-10k.csv`)\r\n* Keep a running sample of 20 samples per thread\r\n* At the end, merge the samples and get a random domain from the merged samples\r\n* Write out the sample\r\n\r\n### Test\r\n* Create a file `~/extractor_sample.json` with the following contents:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"config\" : {\r\n    \"columns\" : {\r\n       \"rank\" : 0,\r\n       \"domain\" : 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_transform\" : {\r\n       \"domain\" : \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD(domain)\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_filter\" : \"LENGTH(domain) > 0\",\r\n    \"state_init\" : \"SAMPLE_INIT(20)\",\r\n    \"state_update\" : {\r\n       \"state\" : \"SAMPLE_ADD(state, domain)\"\r\n                     },\r\n    \"state_merge\" : \"GET_FIRST(SAMPLE_GET(SAMPLE_MERGE(states, SAMPLE_INIT(1))))\",\r\n    \"separator\" : \",\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"extractor\" : \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Summarize via `$METRON_HOME//bin/flatfile_summarizer.sh -i ~/top-10k.csv -o ~/sample.ser -e ./extractor_sample.json -p 5 -b 128`\r\n* Execute `hexdump -C ./sample.ser` and ensure that there is a string in there.  It may end or start with some non-ascii bytes at the beginning and end.\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 ~]# hexdump -C ./sample.ser\r\n00000000  03 01 37 63 66 6d 6e e6                           |..7cfmn.|\r\n00000008\r\n[root@node1 ~]# cat top-10k.csv | grep 7cfmn\r\n4696,7cfmnf.top\r\n```\r\n### Typosquatting Use-case Testing\r\n\r\nYou can also follow the testing plan for #882 as this code is merged into that PR and it shows how this feature can be used in a real use-case.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAs a component of a strategy to detect [Typosquatting]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting), generating typosquatted domains is necessary. As such, a stellar function which replicates the functionality of [dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist) would be of use.\r\n\r\nYou can validate this in the REPL via:\r\n```\r\n{17:10}[system]~/Documents/workspace/metron/fork/incubator-metron:typosquat ✗ ➭ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\" -pl metron-platform/metron-common\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Building metron-common 0.4.2\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.5.0:java (default-cli) @ metron-common ---\r\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.resolver.BaseFunctionResolver).\r\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\r\nlog4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nPlease note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n[Stellar]>>> Functions loaded, you may refer to functions now...\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>>\r\n[Stellar]>>> filter := REDUCE( DOMAIN_TYPOSQUAT( 'amazon' ), (s, d) -> BLOOM_ADD(s, d), BLOOM_INIT())\r\n[Stellar]>>> BLOOM_EXISTS( filter, 'amazon')\r\ntrue\r\n[Stellar]>>> BLOOM_EXISTS( filter, 'google')\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> BLOOM_EXISTS( filter, 'amazoon')\r\ntrue\r\n[Stellar]>>>\r\n```\r\nNote: By itself, this is of some interest, but is not a complete solution.  I suggest as a follow-on to this, two JIRAs:\r\n1. the ability through a new mode for the flat-file loader to write out serialized objects (e.g. a bloom filter containing all the typosquatted domains for a CSV of domains)\r\n2. the ability to take a serialized object from HDFS and load it into memory and return it (e.g. `OBJECT_GET(path)` (with a cache in front of it)\r\n\r\nWith these, in conjunction with the stellar function from this PR, we should have the ability to scalably detect typosquatted domains at the enrichment phase:\r\n1. with the flat file loader, generate a bloom filter containing the typosquatted domains from the set of known good domains\r\n2. upload to HDFS\r\n3. As an enrichment:\r\n```\r\nis_typosquatted := BLOOM_EXISTS(OBJECT_GET('/apps/metron/typosquat/alexa1m.ser', domain))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nPlease see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1373 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1163\r\n\r\nThis extends a fix already accepted in 0.4.1, for a file that got renamed and therefore needs an additional exclusion.\r\n\r\nThis is the patch for master, which is 5 commits beyond 0.4.2.  We would like to stay with the known stable RC candidate contents, so this fix will be separately committed to 0.4.2.  If by chance it is rejected here, it will be reverted there.\r\n\r\nTest procedure:  Please note that this issue can ONLY be seen if one unrolls a tarball (as from the dist repository) rather than cloning from github.  So test this fix with the RC2.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, do the following:\r\n```\r\nmkdir workdir; cd workdir\r\nwget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/metron/0.4.2-RC1/apache-metron-0.4.2-rc1.tar.gz\r\ntar xvzf apache-metron-0.4.2-rc1.tar.gz\r\ncd apache-metron-0.4.2-rc1\r\nmvn clean\r\nmvn install -DskipTests\r\n```\r\nWhen it comes to metron-alerts module, apache-rat-plugin should error, complaining about:\r\n```\r\nFiles with unapproved licenses:\r\n.../metron-interface/metron-alerts/dist/styles. f56deed131e58bd7ee04.bundle.css\r\n```\r\nTo test the patch, repeat the test, changing \"RC1\" to \"RC2\" and \"rc1\" to \"rc2\" in all instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

PR introduces the ability through a new `magic` command for a stellar shell user to view the timing information for the last statement the shell executed.  The information provided is the total execution time, and the execution time per stellar function, and is tagged when creating the timings.\r\nThese tags can be passed to ~~%timing~~ %time to filter the output.  In other words if you call\r\n\r\n~~`%timing FUNCTION`~~ %time FUNCTION  you will only the total time, and any timings that have been tagged as FUNCTION\r\n\r\nAt this point, only the stellar function and lambda executions have been timed, but it is possible in the future to add timing to other parts of stellar.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nPlease note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n[Stellar]>>> Functions loaded, you may refer to functions now...\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>> hex:=\"91IMOR3F41BMUSJCCG======\"\r\n[Stellar]>>> if( STARTS_WITH(TO_UPPER(DECODE(hex,'BASE32HEX')), \"HELLO\")) THEN TO_LOWER(\"OK\") ELSE TO_LOWER(\"FFFF\")\r\nok\r\n[Stellar]>>> %time\r\n->execute : 113ms : 113017132\r\n-->if( STARTS_WITH(TO_UPPER(DECODE(hex,'BASE32HEX')), \"HELLO\")) THEN TO_LOWER(\"OK\") ELSE TO_LOWER(\"FFFF\") : 112ms : 112998881ns\r\n--->DECODE : 8ms : 8572968ns\r\n--->TO_UPPER : 0ms : 20018ns\r\n--->STARTS_WITH : 0ms : 30586ns\r\n--->TO_LOWER : 0ms : 19085ns\r\n```\r\nor more complex, showing tags and filtering\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[Stellar]>>> foo:=1\r\n[Stellar]>>> match { foo == 0 => ()-> false, foo == 1 => ()-> TO_UPPER(\"true\"), default => ()-> false }\r\nTRUE\r\n[Stellar]>>> %time\r\n->execute[] : 4242ms : 4242237640ns\r\n-->match { foo == 0 => ()-> false, foo == 1 => ()-> TO_UPPER(\"true\"), default => ()-> false }[] : 84ms : 84362570ns\r\n--->lambda[LAMBDA] : 1ms : 1265895ns\r\n---->TO_UPPER[FUNCTION] : 0ms : 570672ns\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>> %time FUNCTION\r\n->execute[] : 7594ms : 7594583655ns\r\n-->match { foo == 0 => ()-> false, foo == 1 => ()-> TO_UPPER(\"true\"), default => ()-> false }[] : 84ms : 84362570ns\r\n---->TO_UPPER[FUNCTION] : 0ms : 570672ns\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>> %time LAMBDA\r\n->execute[] : 14374ms : 14374556116ns\r\n-->match { foo == 0 => ()-> false, foo == 1 => ()-> TO_UPPER(\"true\"), default => ()-> false }[] : 84ms : 84362570ns\r\n--->lambda[LAMBDA] : 1ms : 1265895ns\r\n```\r\n\r\n## StackWatch\r\nA set of utility classes under the new package stellar.common.timing have been added.  These provide the `StackWatch` functionality.\r\n\r\nStackWatch provides an abstraction over the Apache Commons StopWatch class that allows callers to \r\ncreate multiple named and possibly nested timing operations.\r\n\r\nSince Stellar operations are executed in a queue and in isolation ( even a Stellar statement that is nested  such as  TO_UPPER(TO_STRING()) is executed as  TO_STRING(), TO_UPPER, the benefit of the support for nested timing operations is not utilized.  If the function is part of a LambdaExpression, you will however see the nesting, as shown in the example above.\r\n\r\nThis class may be more generally useful to this and other projects, but I am not sure where it would live since we wouldn't want it in common.\r\n\r\nStackWatch uses a combination of `Deque` and a custom Tree implementation to create, start and end timing operations.\r\n\r\nA `Visitor` pattern is also implemented to allow for retrieving the results after the completion of the operation.\r\n\r\nSee the StackWatch tests for examples of nested function timings.\r\n\r\nThe StackWatch is optionally available from the Stellar `Context` object.\r\n\r\nThe shell stores the watch from the previous run, while clearing it from the context.  This allows for multiple %timing calls to be executed ( multiple visits ), each possibly with different parameters.\r\n\r\n> NOTE: I ~~am going to see about submitting~~ have submitted  https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/311 to Apache Commons Lang as well, if that happens, we would switch over to the official implementation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n- Run the Stellar Shell, either from full_dev or using mvn exec ( here run from metron-stellar/stellar-common after a mvn package )\r\n```\r\n> % mvn exec:java  -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- run some stellar statements\r\n- run the %time \r\n- run the %time FUNCTION \r\n- run the %time LAMBDA\r\n- in full dev verify that data is processed normally through storm, and that it shows in kibana\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nTrending entropy for various volumetric statistics (e.g. netflow data) has been a useful metric for intrusion detection (see http://www.cs.bu.edu/techreports/pdf/2005-002-anomaly-mining.pdf). To wit, it makes some sense to add an entropy calculation for Stellar. Used in conjunction with the profiler and an outlier detector, we can recreate the work of Lakhina referenced above.\r\n\r\nYou can validate this from the REPL:\r\n* `IT_ENTROPY({ 'a' : 10, 'b' : 5, 'c' : 5} )` should yield `1.5`\r\n  * By the definition of Entropy: `H(X) = -p(a)*log_2(p(a)) - p(b)*log_2(p(b)) - p(c)*log_2(p(c)) = -0.5*-1 - 0.25*-2 - 0.25*-2 = 1.5`\r\n* `IT_ENTROPY({})` should yield `0.0`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now the profiler is a sparse system, namely if data is not written during a profile period for a given profile and entity, no values are written to HBase. Some algorithms may need non-sparse data (e.g. time series outlier detection algorithms). We should keep the default behavior as it stands, but allow the user at read time to specify a default value. This is most cleanly done by using the existing profiler config overrides (the 4rd argument to `PROFILE_GET`) and adding a `profiler.default.value`.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to validate this in the REPL in full-dev by running:\r\n```\r\nPROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', PROFILE_FIXED(4, 'HOURS'), { 'profiler.default.value' : 'metron'} )\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a list of strings with 16 or 17 copies of `metron` in it.\r\nIf you run it without the overrides, you should see an empty list returned.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWith short circuiting in Stellar, we have the opportunity to delve into more computationally intensive outlier detection techniques. Generally these would be executed only if simpler outlier detection techniques indicated an outlier (e.g. statistical outlier tests).\r\nAs the first one of these supported, I'd suggest a Robust PCA based technique similar to Netflix's Surus. See https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/rad-outlier-detection-on-big-data-d6b0494371cc and https://metamarkets.com/2012/algorithmic-trendspotting-the-meaning-of-interesting/ for more detail.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there are some caveats with this approach around sparsity and orderedness.\r\nRegarding sparsity,this outlier detection algorithm presumes dense output, which is not the case for data spanning profiles (e.g. the profiler does not write out data every period if no data was seen). To deal with this, I am suggesting a modification to the profiler to allow `PROFILE_GET` to return a default value. That will be done in a separate JIRA (see #871)\r\n\r\nRegarding well-orderedness, this is an outlier detector for time series data, so it is sensitive to order to a certain extent. Given its computational intensity, it is likely to be used with a sample of the data to shrink the size of the data. To that end, uniform sampling is not sensible here, but rather a biased sample for recency. Without this, you may get poor results from this outlier detector. This sampler should be done in a separate JIRA, but I will ensure the infrastructure to add it is contributed in METRON-1350 (see #867).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR allows us to create DEB packages to simplify the installation of Metron on a DEB-based platform like Ubuntu.  I tried to follow as closely as possible the current mechanism that we use for building RPM packages.\r\n\r\nI added an additional profile `build-debs` that allows us to build the DEBs.\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -Pbuild-debs\r\n```\r\nThere is also a fairly complete README.md that explains how the process works.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Build the DEBs.\r\n    ```\r\n    make clean package -DskipTests\r\n    cd metron-deployment\r\n    mvn clean package -Pbuild-debs -Pbuild-rpms\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Take a look at the DEBs that were built.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ find ./ -name \"*.deb\"\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-management_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-alerts_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-rest_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-maas-service_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-common_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-enrichment_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-data-management_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-parsers_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-profiler_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-config_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-elasticsearch_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-solr_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-indexing_0.4.2.deb\r\n    .//packaging/docker/deb-docker/target/metron-pcap-backend_0.4.2.deb\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install the DEBs.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd packaging/docker/deb-docker\r\n    docker build -t deb-docker .\r\n    docker run -it -v `pwd`:/root deb-docker:latest /bin/bash\r\n    dpkg -i target/*.deb\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.  Capture the contents of what is installed by all of the DEBs.  Capture the output of running `tree` so that you can compare it to what the RPMs install.  \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    apt-get install tree\r\n    tree /usr/metron/0.4.2\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    I have attached the output of what I get when doing this to this PR; [ubuntu.txt](https://github.com/apache/metron/files/1560505/ubuntu.txt).\r\n\r\n1. Take a look at the RPMs that were built previously.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd ../rpm-docker\r\n    $ find ./ -name \"*.rpm\"\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-profiler-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-maas-service-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-rest-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-config-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-enrichment-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-pcap-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-elasticsearch-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-indexing-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-data-management-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-common-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-metron-management-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-alerts-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-solr-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//RPMS/noarch/metron-parsers-0.4.2-201712141550.noarch.rpm\r\n    .//SRPMS/metron-0.4.2-201712141550.src.rpm\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install the RPMs.\r\n    ```\r\n    docker build -t rpm-docker .\r\n    docker run -it -v `pwd`:/root rpm-docker:latest /bin/bash\r\n    rpm -ivh RPMS/noarch/metron-*.rpm\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Capture the contents of what is installed by all of the RPMs.  Capture the output of running `tree`.  I have attached the output of what I get when doing this.\r\n    ```\r\n    yum install tree -y\r\n    tree /usr/metron/0.4.2\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    I have attached the output of what I get when doing this to this PR; [centos.txt](https://github.com/apache/metron/files/1560504/centos.txt).\r\n\r\n1. Now I compare the two.  I have found them to be identical with one exception.\r\n\r\n    In my testing, I have found that there is one extra directory on the Ubuntu/DEB side of the house; `/usr/metron/0.4.2/web/expressjs/etc`.  This is just an empty directory that I believe gets stripped out when the RPMs are packaged.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ diff ubuntu.txt centos.txt\r\n    1c1\r\n    < /usr/metron/0.4.2/\r\n    ---\r\n

PR contains the Bundle system and Maven Plugin.\r\n\r\nThe bundle system and the plugin are adapted from the Apache Nifi project.  \r\n\r\n## bundles-maven-plugin\r\nThe bundles-maven-plugin is an adapted version of the jar dependency plugin whose function is to bundle a jar of jars based on the dependencies for a project.  It also creates metadata attributes.\r\nA project's jar, and it's non-provided dependency jars are place in a /lib entry in the bundle, with the bundle itself being in jar format.\r\n\r\n## bundles-lib \r\nThe bundles-lib contains the functionality required to:\r\n- discover bundles\r\n- inspect bundles for exposed extension types\r\n- load the bundles\r\n- create special class loaders for bundles\r\n- deliver instances of extension types for use\r\n\r\nNAR exposed the bundles through many classes.  I have created the BundleSystem interface to expose a more usable, simplified api for our use cases.\r\n\r\n### From the original PR for METRON-777:\r\nMetron Bundle Plugin\r\n- adaptation of the nifi plugin\r\n- more configurable wrt file extension/dependency and metadata naming\r\nbundle-lib\r\n- adaptation of nifi-nar-utils to be used outside of the nifi project\r\n- rudimentary extensibility to allow configuration and injection of service types and other things that were hard coded to nifi\r\n- refactored from File based to VFS based\r\n- rebranding to Bundle from Nar ( although the lib and the plugin allow that to be configured now )\r\n- added capability to the properties class to write to stream, adapted to uri from paths\r\n- added integration tests for hdfs\r\n- changed to be ClassIndex based instead of ServiceLoader. Service loader is slower, and Casey's ClassIndex work is great. This also removes the NAR's required manual maintenance of the service file.\r\n- refactored to use VFS to load the bundle/nar into the classloader AND to use VFS to load the dependency jars -> VFS as a composite filesystem. Thus going from NAR's 'working directory', exploded NARS to just loading the bundle/nar.\r\n\r\n## Previous Review\r\nPlease see [@mattf_apache's review](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530/files/c5f8c34e4de8e6d456b97edd6f8a0d33b4819d69)\r\n\r\n## changes from that review\r\nI have changed the InitContext operations to have explicit builders, and made it so that creating a context can be done separately from initialization.  Two contexts can then be 'merged'.  This is to allow for the addition of new bundles after initialization.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this PR I have:\r\n- made checkstyle fixes\r\n- fixed several types\r\n- added a requested set of tests loading and executing simple interface/implementation from bundle beyond what is already in the bundle-lib tests\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n*` cd bundles-maven-plugin && mvn -q install && cd .. ` must be run once to install the maven plugin\r\n* This review is code review and test code review and running only\r\n* [Test Project](https://github.com/ottobackwards/test-bundles-plugin) can be examined as a simple example of how to create bundles.\r\n* The README.md has getting started and quickstart sections with some overview of creating by hand\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Metron service check can often use the incorrect hostname when checking the Alerts UI, Management UI, and REST services.  This results in a failed service check, even when the services are running successfully.\r\n\r\nAmbari can run the service check on any node in the cluster, not just the node the service is actually running on.  The service check code currently uses the hostname on which the service check is running.  If the service is not actually installed on that host, the service check will incorrectly fail.\r\n\r\nThe service check code was updated to find the hostname where the service is installed and use that hostname.  \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis change was tested by deploying Metron on Full Dev and running Metron > Service Check in Ambari.  The service check should complete successfully when the cluster is healthy.  The fix has also been tested on a multi-node cluster in the same manner.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf you are sending data into metron indexing without a source.type, which would only happen if you're bypassing our previous topologies, we cannot configure how we write to the indices, so the message should be explicitly failed and reported.\r\n\r\nTo test this, you can send a message into the indexing topic via kafka console producer that looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"value\" : \"foo\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEnsure that the tuple is failed and an error message indicating that a `source.type` is required is written to the storm UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a simple PR to add FieldTransformation capabilities to the parsers allowing basic projection. There are definitely better ways to implement this as reflected in the comments, but those would need a wide ranging refactor of FieldTransformations, so I've decided to shelve that for now. \r\n\r\nSteps to check:\r\n1. Create a sensor with the fieldTransformation set per\r\n```\r\n{\r\n...\r\n    \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n          {\r\n            \"output\" : [\"field1\", \"field2\" ] \r\n          , \"transformation\" : \"SELECT\"\r\n          }\r\n                      ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPass in data with fields field1, field2 and some other fields. \r\n\r\nEnsure that the data coming out of that parser only contains field1, field2, and the timestamp and original_string fields.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR will add infrastructure to our Travis build that will allow the Alerts UI e2e test to be run.  There are several outstanding issues that still need to be worked out so DO NOT MERGE this yet.\r\n\r\nThis is a first pass at a potential Docker-based solution and is meant to be a POC.  The intention is to facilitate further discussion around the general approach and provide a working example that we can build off of.  \r\n\r\nA good place to start is the .travis file.  This provides a good guide on how this infrastructure is spun up.  It is assumed Docker and Docker Compose are installed.  To use outside of travis in a local dev environment (assuming Mac OSX): \r\n\r\n1. Build Metron with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`\r\n1. Create a Docker machine with `metron-contrib/metron-docker/scripts/create-docker-machine.sh`\r\n1. Set the Docker env variables with `eval $(docker-machine env metron-machine)`\r\n1. Build the base Metron image that installs Java:  `docker build ./metron-centos/ -t \"metron-centos\"`\r\n1.  Spin up the environment:  `cd metron-contrib/metron-docker-e2e/compose && docker-compose up -d`\r\n\r\nA working environment should now be available.  To verify get the Docker machine address with `echo $DOCKER_HOST`.  Services should be available on the ports specified in `metron-contrib/metron-docker-e2e/compose/docker-compose.yml`.  For example, assuming my $DOCKER_HOST is \"tcp://192.168.99.100:2376\", Elasticsearch should be available at http://192.168.99.100:9210.\r\n\r\nAt this point only a single e2e test is run due to the significant refactoring being done in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/857.  \r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts so far based on work in this PR:\r\n\r\n- The Docker environment creation and startup adds about 3 minutes to the build.  This is about what I expected and hopefully we can get this time back as we move other tests to a reusable environment.\r\n- I'm not convinced spinning up containers for the Alerts UI and REST are necessary or desired.  We may be able to cut some time off the build by running them directly on the Travis host instead of in Docker\r\n- I experimented with caching the Docker images but pulling them every time was actually faster\r\n\r\nThere is still significant work to be done including:\r\n- I was able to get the full suite of tests to run successfully in previous commits but have all but e2e tests commented out for now to make it easier to see what's going on in Travis.  These will need to be added back once we get closer to a final solution.\r\n- Once the e2e test refactoring is done those changes will need merged in and tested\r\n- The license check is commented out right now because I inadvertently added some new dependency versions (have no idea why).  Still need to track that down.\r\n- There is an intermittent error that happens when starting up REST.  Still working on tracking this down.\r\n \r\nLooking forward to some feedback.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR aims to improve the existing e2e tests of metro-alerts in the areas mentioned below. The PR doesn't add/remove any functionality to the existing alerts ui. However, there are few changes in HTML templates where I a needed a new selector for tests.\r\n\r\n- Delete the contents of table 'metron_update' in HBase\r\n  - I have added a nodes script that deletes the 'metron_update' table before each run of e2e tests\r\n- Ensure that the tests run consistently on latest version of node \r\n  - I have tested and added a check to node version 8.9. If the version is less than 8.9 there is a warning and tests run continues\r\n- Improving description of test specs\r\n  - Added meaningful descriptions wherever applicable. Let me know if we need any more descriptions\r\n- Run the tests on a headless browser to improve reliability\r\n  - Added the headless option to protractor.conf.js\r\n- Stop polling in the UI, it might cause tests to be flaky by refreshing at an unexpected time\r\n  - Added POLLING_DEFAULT_STATE to environment variables that would controll if polling is enabled in UI by default\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tests are written using:\r\nOS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 \r\nnodejs: v8.9.1.\r\nChrome:  62.0.3202.94\r\n\r\nThe tests should run reasonably well on other platforms since I personally didn't test on them I would request you to report any tests failure with information about your  OS, nodejs and browser version.\r\n\r\nI bumped up the version of the protractor to 5.2.0, so please run npm install before testing the PR. Please let me know if you need any more details about the PR.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nIf all the e2e tests run fine the PR  is good.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNo new documentation is needed specifically for this PR. The steps to run the e2e tests remains the way they are before. I added a couple of caveats in Readme about deleting 'metron_update' table and headless chrome. Please let me know if we can improve our docs for e2e tests I would be glad to add it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

provide statements for validation.  This discovery allows de-coupling of stellar and 'hosts' that know about the location of the stored statements, and the configuration structure details.\r\n\r\n> We do mention the configurations in the shell output at this time.\r\n\r\n`metron-common` implements this interface, and can run through visiting all the configurations.\r\n\r\nA management function was added ` VALIDATE_STELLAR_RULE_CONFIGS()`\r\nWhen executed, the shell \r\n\r\n- discovers the reporters through class index \r\n- visits the reports, with callbacks for visits or errors\r\n- per visit ( which is called for a specific stellar statement ) the statement is compiled and errors reported\r\n- if the entire config fails ( threat triage stellar errors fail on deserialize so we don't get to do ANY enrichment visits in that case ) the error callback handles that\r\n\r\nI'm getting this out there, still a couple of things todo:\r\n\r\n[x] ~~full dev run.

is a PR to get feedback on some minor improvements that I was experimenting with.  If the community finds any of this useful, I will open a proper PR and JIRA for this work.   All feedback welcome; positive or negative.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR should not be merged.\r\n\r\n### Faster CI Builds\r\n\r\nThe first piece here is that I leveraged [Travis' Matrix functionality](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Build-Matrix) so that the unit tests, integration tests, web unit tests, and license check runs in parallel rather than sequentially.\r\n\r\nBenefit 1: Prior to this change the CI builds take anywhere between 30 - 34 minutes.  After this change the last 4 test builds have taken 24m 49s, 26m 20s, 23m 40s, and 24m 31s.  This is not huge, but seems to be an incremental improvement nonetheless.  \r\n\r\nBenefit 2: This also helps when in the future we need need to add additional validation/functionality to the CI build.  Any additional functionality will easily run in parallel and not unnecessarily extend the overall build time.\r\n\r\n### Automate Maven Installation\r\n\r\nThere is a tool called [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) that will automatically install Maven for a user.  And also importantly,  it will install the exact correct version that we specify.  I found this [mentioned in the Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java/), so I assume it has a large enough following.\r\n\r\nMy thought is that anything we can do to reduce friction for a new user to work with Metron is a good thing.  At the very least this simplifies prerequisite installation and can prevent one source of errors.  \r\n\r\nInstead of installing Maven manually and then running `mvn clean install`, a user can just run `./mvn clean install`. This will automatically install the correct version of Maven in Windows, Mac, or Linux before building Metron.  This also works correctly in Travis.\r\n\r\nI should also mention this is backwards compatible.  If you want to use your own mvn, then feel free to continue on with `mvn clean install`.\r\n\r\nThe ./mvn and ./mvn.cmd files were generated by me simply running `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper`.  We would run the same sort of command again to update these scripts should we need to.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-29T17:56:01Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T19:21:18Z","closed_at":"2017-12-19T12:42:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29e965624d335381d4b710f89153bfef404cbecb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/8671c442409d7ade7fb23d5d5c1a9dc93318c903","head":{"label":"nickwallen:experimental-test-improvements","ref":"experimental-test-improvements","sha":"8671c442409d7ade7fb23d5d5c1a9dc93318c903","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR makes the list of facet fields in the Alerts UI configurable.  There is now a \"search.facet.fields\" setting in https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-interface/metron-rest/src/main/resources/application.yml that is a comma-separate list of fields to be used as facets.  Originally a comment was made that the \"host\" field wasn't commonly used so I removed that from the default list.\r\n\r\nI can think of two options for exposing this configuration: \r\n- through an AlertProfile that is specific to each user, stored in a relational database and can be edited through REST\r\n- a setting that is exposed in Ambari\r\n\r\nI chose to include the first option in this PR to get the conversation going.  Is one of these preferable?  The AlertProfile approach allows this setting to be changed at runtime and each user has their own list of facet fields.  But it is not versioned like it would if it were in Ambari.  Do we prefer one over the other?  Do we want both with Ambari being the default when an AlertProfile doesn't exist for a user?  Are there other options I'm not thinking of?\r\n\r\nThis works similar to how default search indices work:  it is managed in the REST layer and can be overriden by including facet fields in a search request.  However it seemed useful to allow a way to explicitly NOT include facets in a query so it works slightly different than indices.  A missing facetFields property in the request will use the defaults while an empty array will disable facets.  A missing indices property or an empty array will use the default indices.  Is this the correct behavior?  \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev and the UI e2e tests pass when run in isolation.  There is currently an effort to stabilize the e2e tests as a follow on to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803 so I did not try to solve that here.  \r\n\r\nI will add some documentation around configuring the facet field list and facetFields behavior in a search request once we come to a consensus on the solution.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I would like to point out.  When I added facetFields to the AlertProfile object it required a database update because that new field needed to be added to the database.  This would become an issue if someone were upgrading from a previous version.  Is this acceptable if we document it for future upgrades?  Is a relational database the right solution or should we consider a more flexible storage option?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the previous discussion referenced in JIRA, this PR drops support for the Quick Dev and Code Lab environments.  These have been effectively dead for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nI tested this by performing a Full Dev deployment and Amazon EC2 deployment just to make sure I didn't delete anything that I should not have.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to get the metron-deployments directory cleaned-up and reorganized to make it easier for new users to build and deploy Metron.  This is the first step.\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-28T21:00:46Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T19:21:14Z","closed_at":"2017-11-30T15:31:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3059fb4218ac097ef33674cdc59056d3c8312287","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/a3a9346b2a6c30a686998edb5fd643ec4e6f0ba4","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-1239","ref":"METRON-1239","sha":"a3a9346b2a6c30a686998edb5fd643ec4e6f0ba4","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

following problems are addressed in this PR.\r\n\r\n* A patch can be constructed that when applied creates an invalid configuration.  The invalid configuration is not discovered until attempting to \"pull\" it back out of Zookeeper.  In all cases, the result of applying a patch needs to be validated before pushing it to Zookeeper.\r\n\r\n* The Profiler configuration can only be pushed when pushing all configurations at once.  Attempting to push just the Profiler configuration alone, fails silently.\r\n\r\n* I do not believe that validation was occurring in all cases; in particular when pushing a specific configuration type (like pushing \"Squid\", PARSING alone.)  Validation was occurring in other cases, like when all configuration elements are pushed at once.\r\n\r\n* Added unit tests to validate that a 'bad' patch cannot be applied.\r\n\r\n* Added a good number of unit tests to ensure invalid configurations cannot be pushed under all circumstances (parser, enrichment, indexing, profiler, \"push all\").\r\n\r\n* Added a test to ensure that the Profiler configuration can be pushed independently.\r\n\r\n## Manual Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch Full Dev.\r\n\r\n1. Environment definitions that will be used later.\r\n    ```\r\n    export METRON_HOME=/usr/metron/0.4.2\r\n    export ZOOKEEPER=node1:2181\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Dump all existing configurations.\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Dump just the Profiler configuration.  There should be none.\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c PROFILER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a Profiler configuration on disk.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ cat $METRON_HOME/config/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n1. Push the Profiler configuration.  \r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PUSH -c PROFILER -i $METRON_HOME/config\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Dump just the Profiler configuration.  It should be defined now.\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c PROFILER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a patch for the Profiler configuration.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ cat profile.patch\r\n    [\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t\"op\": \"add\",\r\n    \t\t\"path\": \"/profiles/0/profile\",\r\n    \t\t\"value\": \"changed-profile-name\"\r\n    \t}\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Apply the patch.\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c PROFILER -pf profile.patch\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Dump the Profiler configuration and ensure that the name of the Profile was changed.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c PROFILER\r\n      PROFILER Config: profiler\r\n      {\r\n        \"profiles\" : [ {\r\n          \"profile\" : \"changed-profile-name\",\r\n          \"onlyif\" : \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n          \"foreach\" : \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n          \"init\" : {\r\n            \"count\" : \"0\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"update\" : {\r\n            \"count\" : \"count + 1\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"result\" : \"count\"\r\n        } ]\r\n      }\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n1. Create a patch that would make the Profiler configuration invalid. \r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat bad.patch\r\n      [\r\n      \t{\r\n      \t\t\"op\": \"add\",\r\n      \t\t\"path\": \"/profiles/0/invalid\",\r\n      \t\t\"value\": \"22\"\r\n      \t}\r\n      ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.  Apply the bad patch.   The script should terminate with an error.\r\n    ``` \r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m PATCH -c PROFILER -pf bad.patch\r\n    2017-11-28 17:37:17 ERROR ConfigurationManager:314 - Unable to apply patch to Zookeeper config\r\n    java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to load {\r\n      \"profiles\" : [ {\r\n        \"profile\" : \"changed-profile-name\",\r\n        \"onlyif\" : \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n        \"foreach\" : \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\" : {\r\n          \"count\" : \"0\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"update\" : {\r\n          \"count\" : \"count + 1\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"result\" : \"count\",\r\n        \"invalid\" : \"22\"\r\n      } ]\r\n    }\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.configuration.ConfigurationType.lambda$static$4(ConfigurationType.java:68)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.configuration.ConfigurationType.deserialize(ConfigurationType.java:93)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.configuration.ConfigurationsUtils.applyConfigPatchToZookeeper(ConfigurationsUtils.java:621)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.cli.ConfigurationManager.patch(ConfigurationManager.java:307)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.cli.ConfigurationManager.run(ConfigurationManager.java:285)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.cli.ConfigurationManager.run(ConfigurationManager.java:244)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.common.cli.ConfigurationManager.main(ConfigurationManager.java:360)\r\n    Caused by: org.apache.metron.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field \"invalid\" (class org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileConfig), not marked as ignorable (8 known properties: \"init\", \"expires\", \"groupBy\", \"profile\", \"foreach\", \"result\", \"onlyif\", \"update\"])\r\n     at [Source: {\r\n      \"profiles\" : [ {\r\n        \"profile\" : \"changed-profile-name\",\r\n        \"onlyif\" : \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n        \"foreach\" : \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"init\" : {\r\n          \"count\" : \"0\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"update\" : {\r\n          \"count\" : \"count + 1\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"result\" : \"count\",\r\n        \"invalid\" : \"22\"\r\n      } ]\r\n      ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

of the module dependencies for the Management and Alerts UI must be built natively on the host.  This requires a C/C++ compiler.  In addition, some of the dependencies require a C++11 compliant compiler.  This is causing problems for users who attempt to build Metron on a system with an older version of GCC, like CentOS 6.\r\n\r\nNot having a C++11 compliant compiler can cause some non-obvious error messages when the build fails.  This adds a version check for GCC and also a C++11 compliance check.  The compiler itself must be on the user's PATH, which is what the Node modules also require.\r\n\r\nIf the compiler is C++11 compliant, you will see the following.\r\n```\r\n--\r\ng++\r\ng++ (GCC) 5.3.1 20160406 (Red Hat 5.3.1-6)\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

ansible-docker container could be used to build metron ( even the rpms ) and run the ansible scripts. This is no longer true, as the new node ui projects have native compilation that requires c++ 11 support in gcc, and rpm build requires node to be installed ( not local installed as in the mvn packaging ).\r\nMany users are having problems building metron on centos platforms, having this container available and functioning would be a great help.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this by:\r\n\r\n- installing devtoolset-4 into the container to get cpp 11\r\n- creating a .bash_profile for root that enables the devtoolset environment\r\n- installing node into the container since building rpms now requires node ( and not just the local node used during building in maven )\r\n- documenting building in container, as well as mapping local .m2 repo into the container\r\n\r\nYou can now build and test metron, including building the rpms.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nFollow the steps in the read me and build metron:\r\n\r\n`mvn clean package`\r\n`mvn clean package -DskipTests`\r\n`mvn clean install && cd metron-deployment && mvn package -P build-rpms`\r\n\r\nAlso, after building with the rpms, exit docker\r\nand do full_dev with\r\n`vagrant --ansible-skip-tags=\"build, quick_dev\" up`  and verify that you can use vagrant with the doc built packaging and rpms.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

creating Metaalerts in the Alerts UI, I am unable to sort by threat triage score.  This only occurs AFTER creating a Metaalert.  \r\n\r\nThe exception that is logged is shown in the issue.  When opening the Developer view in Chrome, I can see the API responds with an error.  An error message is logged under `/var/log/metron/metron-rest.log`.\r\n\r\n## What happened?\r\n\r\nAn overall threat score is added to a Metaalert whenever it has any child alerts.  This overall threat score is a summary of the threat scores from each of the child alerts.  \r\n\r\nThis field is also named the same as the threat score fields from the sensor indices; 'threat:triage:score'.  The type of this field must be the same as the 'threat:triage:score' fields from each of the sensor indices.  Otherwise the Alerts UI cannot properly sort alerts and metaalerts in the same table/view in the UI.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nI updated the `ElasticsearchMetaalertDao` so that when it creates the overall threat score, it is added as a Float to match the type expected from the other sensor indices.  \r\n\r\nI also updated the unit tests to specifically check for this condition, along with other Javadoc improvements to clarify things.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin up Full Dev with this PR\r\n2. Run the Alerts UI from #803.  This enables the creation of Metaalerts in the Alerts UI.  The following will execute the Alerts UI and use `node1` (created in step 1) as the backend.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-interface/metron-alerts/\r\n    npm install\r\n    ./scripts/start-dev.sh\r\n    ``` \r\n3. Open up the Alerts UI; http://localhost:4201/\r\n4. Sort by triage score and assure no errors occur\r\n5. Create a Metaalert.\r\n6. Sort by triage score and assure no errors occur\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adjusts the Column Metadata REST service to use a list of default indices when an empty list is passed in.  This behavior is similar to the search method and keeps the Alerts UI from having to track the current list of available indices.\r\n\r\nI added test cases and verified the relevant tests in our Alerts UI end-to-end test now pass.  Still need to spin up full dev and validate there.  Will report back once I have successfully done that but this can be reviewed in the meantime.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

16.11.1 will no longer compile against newer Linux kernels due to an interface change in the kernel.  \r\n\r\nThis can be replicated in the Fastcapa test environment.  We use the `bentos/centos-7.1` image for the test environment.  In this image, the underlying Linux kernel has been updated which makes it no longer work with DPDK 16.11.1.\r\n\r\nThis change upgrades DPDK to 17.08 in the test environment and also updates Fastcapa to accomodate a function signature change in the newer version of DPDK.\r\n\r\nI also added the ability to run the same Fastcapa test code under multiple operating systems.  So now we can validate that Fastcapa runs in CentOS 7.1 and also CentOS 7.4, for example.  Additional platforms could easily be added.\r\n\r\nI also removed an old Ansible role that is no longer being used.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Run the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/vagrant/fastcapa-test-platform/centos-7.1\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.  The deployment should complete with a message like so.\r\n    ```\r\n    Successfully received a Kafka message from fastcapa!\r\n    ````\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This is ready now (11/30/17)\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the great work in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/619\r\n\r\n## Contributor Comments\r\nI wanted to get eyes on this despite some outstanding work left. It was no small undertaking moving 3 major versions, so there's quite a bit to review. In the future I would like to recommend we make feature branches for changes of this magnitude. \r\n\r\nThis work upgrades Elasticsearch and Kibana both to 5.6. I'm running a local full dev build now, but assuming no failures this will spin up full dev with everything, including the Kibana dashboard (had to be completely rewritten).\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [x] Re-create error dashboard - https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/475\r\n- [x] Fix outstanding test failures\r\n- [x] Another merge with master\r\n- [x] Update ES and Kibana docs\r\n- [x] Document using Curator in place of the pruner tool\r\n- [x] Docs for managing Kibana dashboards (no more pickle file - straight JSON using ES's bulk load API. This was not as easy as you would think it would be.)\r\n- [x] Test with Kerberos\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Service Check in Ambari does not validate that the Elasticsearch index templates have been installed.  Without these index templates bad things can happen.  For example, the Alerts UI will not be able to display any alerts.  With this PR, the Elasticsearch index templates that are installed by Ambari are checked as part of the Metron Service Check.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch a Metron environment like Full Dev\r\n\r\n1. Run the Metron Service Check and ensure that it succeeds.  \r\n\r\n1. Click on Metron > Metron Indexing > Delete Elasticsearch Templates\r\n\r\n1. Run the Metron Service Check and ensure that it fails with an error like the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    Missing Elasticsearch index template: name=yaf_index\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.  Click on Metron > Metron Indexing > Install Elasticsearch Templates.\r\n\r\n1.

Spin up Full Dev or an equivalent Metron environment.\r\n\r\n1. Query Elasticsearch for the currently defined indices.  Take note of all the indices that you have defined.\r\n    ```\r\n    curl http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?v\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Query Elasticsearch for the currently defined templates.

Contributor Comments\r\nBased on the conversation on the [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/dd63e5bcf8a288dfaf3cdd551128e3df59580367080bda5f344e8538@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E), this removes the bro kafka plugin from this repo and pulls it from our new apache/metron-bro-plugin-kafka repo.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n1.  Create a working directory and pull in this PR\r\n    ```\r\n    mkdir ~/metron-1309\r\n    git clone https://github.com/apache/metron ~/metron-1309/metron\r\n    cd ~/metron-1309/metron\r\n    git remote add jonzeolla https://github.com/jonzeolla/metron\r\n    git pull jonzeolla METRON-1309\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Modify [this](https://github.com/JonZeolla/metron/blob/METRON-1309/metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform/Vagrantfile#L20) to remove `sensors,` (to spin up the real sensors).\r\n    ```\r\n    sed -i '' \"s/ansibleSkipTags=.*/ansibleSkipTags=\\'quick_dev\\'/\" metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform/Vagrantfile\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Spin up full-dev\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform/\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Set up the environment in full-dev.\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bro/bin\r\n    service monit stop && service sensor-stubs stop bro && broctl stop\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Monitor the bro kafka topic\r\n    ```\r\n    # Open a new terminal\r\n    cd ~/metron-1309/metron/metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bro/bin:/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin\r\n    kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic bro\r\n    ```\r\n1.  In the first terminal, run bro against some public pcaps.\r\n    ```\r\n    mkdir -p ~/brotmp/nitroba ~/brotmp/example-traffic\r\n    wget https://www.bro.org/static/traces/exercise-traffic.pcap -O ~/brotmp/example-traffic/exercise-traffic.pcap\r\n    wget http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/network-packet-dumps/2008-nitroba/nitroba.pcap -O ~/brotmp/nitroba/nitroba.pcap\r\n    cd ~/brotmp/example-traffic\r\n    bro -r exercise-traffic.pcap /usr/local/bro/share/bro/site/local.bro -C\r\n    cd ~/brotmp/nitroba\r\n    bro -r nitroba.pcap /usr/local/bro/share/bro/site/local.bro -C\r\n    ```\r\n1.  Verify that logs are properly getting to the bro kafka topic, via the second terminal.\r\n    - Note, that if you look in the Kibana UI for the non sensor-stub logs, you will need to change your view to be ~now-10y.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now we warn when an index template install fails. In my opinion, this should be an install failure, not a warning. It's disorienting for the user to have a green install and have the UIs fail to work due to template issues.  I think we should warn in the logs, but also fail fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

 To help avoid causing too much pain with merge conflicts, I'd like to see the following PRs resolved before we consider merging this.\r\n- [x]  #824\r\n- [x]  #825\r\n- [x]  #827\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Adds logic to sort 'missing' fields (fields that are not present in all of the underlying indices.)  For example, threat triage score is only present in the records that have been triaged.  Without this PR, sorting on the threat triage score would unexpectedly filter the search results.\r\n    * When sorted descending, missing fields are sorted last.\r\n    * When sorted ascending, missing fields are sorted first.\r\n\r\n* Adds validation and error checking of the response received from Elasticsearch.  Previously there was little to no validation of the response.  This also handles partial shard failures; errors that occur only on a subset of the data.  Without this change some errors that occurred within Elasticsearch were not visible.\r\n\r\n* Updates to the index templates ensure that the threat triage fields like threat triage overall score and the threat triage rules are mapped to a correct type.  These fields were not mapped correctly.\r\n\r\n* Adds additional logging in the ElasticsearchDAO so that errors can be traced and debugged.\r\n\r\n* Refactored the ElasticsearchDAO and extracted some logic into two new interfaces.  This was done so that I could write tests for the new logic.  It was not possible to specifically test this change without refactoring due to limitations with mocking.\r\n    * The column metadata logic is now contained in `ColumnMetadataDao` and `ElasticsearchColumnMetadataDao`.  Without pulling this logic out, it was not possible to test the new sorting logic.\r\n    * The logic for submitting a request to Elasticsearch and validating the response is now contained within `ElasticsearchSearchSubmitter` class.  Without refactoring this it was not possible to test the  new response handling logic.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch Full Dev\r\n2. Allow some alerts to accumulate so that when you open the Alerts UI there are a fair number of alerts to work with.\r\n3. By default it will sort by timestamp.  Take note of the number of records returned.  \r\n4. Click on the \"Score\" field to sort the results by threat triage score.\r\n5. Note the total number of records returned after sorting.  This should be equal to or greater than what you saw before.\r\n6. The highest scores should be sorted first.  Records that do not contain a threat triage score should be sorted last.\r\n7. Click on the \"Score\" field to reverse the sort order.  Records without a threat triage score should now be sorted first.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently we have the indexing topology handle writing to both random access indices (e.g. elasticsearch) as well as batch write indices (e.g. hdfs). We should split these up and configure them separately.\r\n\r\nIn terms of manual testing, full-dev should continue to function in that:\r\n* Elasticsearch should have data written to it\r\n* HDFS should have data written to it\r\n* The indexing configuration should have separate subsections for random access and batch index writers\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe Time Range component is not working in mac Safri b'coz of the way Safari handles string to date conversions more details about what is wrong with safari is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4310953/invalid-date-in-safari). Also\r\n\r\n-  Took this opportunity to correct typos in a method and in a variable name.\r\n-  ~I added a better waiting strategy for getting values in scrollToDashRow and clickable text methods. From my experience, i feel the new way is much more efficient than the way I was trying to get the values till now.~ \r\n- Extracted the string 'now' to constant since it is used in multiple places\r\n\r\nUpdate: Reverted the changes made to tests since we have a PR to handle it now\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-  Open the Alert UI in safari and select on Date Picker \r\n- Select date from Quick Ranges or Time Range, the From and To Date are not populated and the rest call fails\r\n- Apply the current PR and repeate the above two steps\r\n- You see that the GUI works as expected the Data Range is populated and the rest api would fetch all the results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a bug that prevents the index templates from being installed.

Contributor Comments\r\nBy default, values in facet and group by results are not formatted correctly in some cases (IP addresses being one) so the ElasticsearchDao must correctly format them instead.  To do this it must know the type of each facet/group column to know how to correctly format them.  The root cause of this issue is that the ElasticsearchDao was retrieving \"common\" column metadata, or columns that exist in all indices.  The addition of the \"metaalert\" index broke this because it is missing most of the columns that are declared in alert indices.  This PR corrects this by retrieving all column metadata across indices so that a missing column in one index does not affect the results.\r\n\r\nThe http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/getColumnMetadataUsingPOST changed slightly in that it now just returns a single map with all columns/types included and no longer segments columns/types by index.  This interface more closely matches how this function is used in the alerts UI and eliminates the need for the client side code to flatten the result.  Column metadata can still be retrieved for an index by just passing in a single index to that endpoint.  The case of columns existing in multiple indices with different types is solved by just excluding them from the results.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev by executing a search (either with the Alerts UI or Swagger) and including an ip address field in the facet list.  The results should now include correctly formatted IP addresses in the facetCounts section of the results.  A group query can be verified by including an IP address in the list of group fields.\r\n\r\nI adjusted the SearchControllerIntegrationTest to account for the new interface and modified cases in the SearchIntegrationTest to catch these issues in the future.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a small bug in the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao that only updates the first 10 alerts in a metaalert when that metaalert status is changed to inactive.  This is due to the fact that the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao needs to lookup up the child alerts and a search created with `elasticsearchDao.getClient().prepareSearch()` defaults to result set size to 10.  This can be reproduced in full dev:\r\n- turn off the sensor stubs so that the number of alerts in ES is fixed\r\n- take note of the number of alerts in the index\r\n- create a metaalert with more than 10 alerts\r\n- the number of alerts should decrease to: # of alerts added - 1 metaalert\r\n- change the metaalert status to inactive \r\n- the number of alerts will now be less than before where the count should be the same\r\n\r\nI also added an embarrassingly complex unit test to cover this situation.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes several bugs in the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao that incorrectly update the included alerts.  The MetaAlert endpoints (and underlying DAO interface methods) were refactored to make alert/metaAlert updates easier to implement and understand.  Changes include:\r\n- Updates to meta alert `alert` and `status` fields are no longer allowed via the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/update-controller/patchUsingPATCH endpoint.  There changes require updates to multiple objects and require special handling.\r\n- Adding an alert to a metaAlert is now done through the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/addAlertsToMetaAlertUsingPOST endpoint and requires only guids (and optional sensor types)\r\n- Removing an alert from a meta alert is now done through the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/removeAlertsFromMetaAlertUsingPOST endpoint and requires only guids (and optional sensor types)\r\n- Updating a meta alert `status` is now done through a dedicated http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/updateMetaAlertStatusUsingPOST that requires only a guid and status value\r\n\r\nThese functions can be tested in full dev as follows:\r\n1. Create a meta alert with multiple alerts through the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/createUsingPOST endpoint and record the meta alert guid that is returned:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"36e0a616-1bf2-409b-a965-123783710595\",\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.11.14.23\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    },\r\n {\r\n      \"guid\": \"b676dfc4-19b3-4493-9f6a-20690aea25a9\",\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.11.14.23\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Verify the meta alert was created correctly with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/getLatestUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"guid\": \"7398fc8a-6dc5-42dd-b2e0-7e764691eeff\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. The meta alert should contain the 2 alerts in the create request above in the `alert` field\r\n4. Verify the meta alert was created correctly by querying ES directly `http://node1:9200/metaalert_index/metaalert_doc/7398fc8a-6dc5-42dd-b2e0-7e764691eeff/?pretty` (substitutue the meta alert guid you recorded)\r\n5. Verify the alerts have the `metaalerts` field populated with the meta alert guid you recorded using findOne and directly against ES (same as last 2 steps with alert guid instead)\r\n6. Add a new alert with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/addAlertsToMetaAlertUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"metaAlertGuid\": \"7398fc8a-6dc5-42dd-b2e0-7e764691eeff\",\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"a6f682b0-dea1-4220-9d7f-3829bf54cb06\",\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.11.14.23\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n7. Repeat steps 2-5 to verify the alert was added to the meta alert and the added alert has the meta alert guid in it's `metaalerts` field\r\n8. Remove an alert with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/removeAlertsFromMetaAlertUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"metaAlertGuid\": \"7398fc8a-6dc5-42dd-b2e0-7e764691eeff\",\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"36e0a616-1bf2-409b-a965-123783710595\",\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.11.14.23\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n9. Repeat steps 2-5 to verify the alert was removed from the meta alert and the removed alert no longer has the meta alert in it's `metaalerts` field\r\n10. Change the meta alert status to \"inactive\" with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/updateMetaAlertStatusUsingPOST endpoint using the meta alert guid and the value \"inactive\"\r\n11. Repeat steps 2-5 to verify both alerts no longer have the meta alert guid in the `metaalerts` field and the meta alert status has been updated to \"inactive\".\r\n12. Change the meta alert status back to \"active\" using the same endpoint as the previous step\r\n13. Repeat steps 2-5 to verify the alerts and meta alert look the same as before the status was changed to \"inactive\"\r\n14. Try to update the list of alerts (`alert` field) or `status` field in a meta alert with a patch request (http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/update-controller/patchUsingPATCH).  Either case should throw an error that contains an obvious message stating that these fields cannot be directly updated\r\n15. Updates to any other meta alert field (`name`, `comments`, etc) through the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/update-controller/patchUsingPATCH endpoint should work normally.\r\n\r\nThere are several other cases that should be tested as well:\r\n- try to add an alert that already exists in a meta alert\r\n- try to remove an alert that does not exist in a meta alert\r\n- try changing the status from \"active\" to \"active\" or \"inactive\" to \"inactive\"\r\n- repeat the various tests using more than 10 (ES's default search result size) alerts or meta alerts \r\n- search should properly include meta alerts when a query matches or exclude alerts that are in a meta alert\r\n- any more I'm not thinking of?\r\n\r\nThe tests described here are implemented in the ElasticsearchMetaAlertIntegrationTest class.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adjusts the Alerts UI and REST app to remove the need to hard-code the indices in the Alerts UI source code.  I felt like this feature could be kept simple by having the REST SearchService supply the appropriate indices by default because:\r\n\r\n- the front end code has no knowledge of when the list of available indices changes and would have to make an extra call on every search\r\n- the underlying ElasticsearchDao lives in a different module and does not have access to the SensorIndexingConfigService which is required to look up the available indices\r\n\r\nThis resulted in an additional \"index.writer.name\" property because the indices lookup requires this information.  The \"error\" index doesn't make sense in an alert search context so it is excluded. \r\n The \"metaalert\" index is added by default in anticipation of https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/803.\r\n\r\nA SearchServiceTest had not been created yet so it has been added with coverage for this PR.  An integration test for a query with default indices was also added.  While working on the integration tests I noticed an intermittent failure happening frequently so I fixed that in this PR to get the build to pass consistently (GlobalConfigControllerIntegrationTest.java).  I can revert that if desired but my thinking was it's probably not worth the overhead of a separate PR. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nFor a Metron multi-node deployment using mpack, the Elasticsearch template is required to be installed manually post-setup. These templates are required for the proper working of, for e.g. the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\nIn the event that these templates are not installed, and if data is ingested, these would not be shown in the Alerts UI, since there would be missing fields without the template files (E.g. snort alert indices are not displayed in the Alerts UI, since it is missing the \"alerts\" field from the mapping). In such a case, one needs to install the templates, delete all indices for the given parser and re-ingest data again into the parser for it to appear in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\nFurther, the indices from all the parsers will have to be deleted and re-ingested again which could be a tedious job in the event that this step was missed out by chance. I have also seen other ill-effects from having stale indices for parsers that was created before template install.\r\nWhile documenting the template installation is a good practice, nothing would more failsafe than installing the template as a part of the mpack startup scripts itself.\r\n\r\nI have added the ES template install step just before starting the Indexing topology, since I found this to be the closest related step when this could be done. Do let me know if this needs to be moved to a different point in the startup, and I can make the change.\r\n\r\n**Testing Done**\r\n* Built mpack with the changes\r\n* Deployed a 12-node Metron setup using the mpack\r\n* Validated that the start Indexing topology step also installs the Elasticsearch template files.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

stellar language.  This is very similar to the Scala match feature.\r\n\r\nFROM THE README: \r\n### Stellar Language Match Expression\r\nStellar provides the capability to write match expressions, which are similar to switch statements commonly found in c like languages, but more like\r\nScala's match.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is:\r\n* `match{ logical_expression1 => evaluation expression1, logical_expression2 => evaluation_expression2, default => default_expression}` \r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\n* `logical_expression` is a Stellar expression that evaluates to true or false.  For instance `var > 0` or `var > 0 AND var2 == 'foo'` or `IF ... THEN ... ELSE` \r\n* `evaluation_expression` is any Stellar Expression\r\n* `default` is a required default return value, should no logical expression match\r\n\r\n> default is required \r\n\r\n> Lambda expressions are supported, but they must be no argument lambdas such as `() -> STATEMENT`\r\n\r\n* Only the first clause that evaluates to true will be executed.\r\n\r\n## Review items\r\n\r\n* more test cases\r\n* help with issue with MAP() function\r\n* correctness of short circuit / grammar\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR does not\r\n* add the aliasing of long variables\r\n* support variable arg lambda\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nfrom the Stellar shell execute various statements involving match such as: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nttofowler@Winterfell [13:01:16] [~/src/apache/forks/metron/metron-stellar/stellar-common] [stellar_match]\r\n-> % mvn exec:java \\\r\n   -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarShell\" -Dexec.args=\"-l src/test/resources/log4j.properties\"\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Building stellar-common 0.4.1\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:java (default-cli) @ stellar-common ---\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nPlease note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n[Stellar]>>> Functions loaded, you may refer to functions now...\r\n[Stellar]>>> foo := 1\r\n[Stellar]>>> match{foo == 1 : TO_UPPER('ok')}\r\nOK\r\n[Stellar]>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes an intermittently failing integration test. I believe the root cause is the test is waiting for the wrong config to propagate (that was already written earlier) so it never waits.\r\n\r\nI've run this several times and am not seeing the failure anymore but will continue to run more tests.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdds the ability to hide alerts already contained in a meta alert from searches.  It'll also hide it from the group mechanism (as they've already been sliced and diced).\r\n\r\nThis happens by adding a \"metaalerts\" field to our alerts, which is a simple list of GUIDs.  This does require partial updates to alerts when a meta alert is created or has the status changed from active to inactive or vice versa.  Alerts can potentially be updated when the \"alert\" field of a meta alert is changed (i.e. an alert is added or removed), but this should be limited to alerts that are actually affected.  Given that there are practical limits (iirc, ~1000) alerts that can be in a given meta alert and this is a manual action, it shouldn't be particularly bad.\r\n\r\nA batchUpdate is added to the IndexDao to avoid making a ton of updates to ES. It's added accordingly through the implementors (HBase just uses the List<Put> method, if we want something else let me know, I haven't touched that stuff in awhile).  ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao throws an UnsupportedOperationException both to avoid having to implement it and also because creating meta alerts should generally be a single action as a result of manual intervention, not a bulk operation.\r\n\r\n~Right now, there is an update to the templates to make them \"not_analyzed\".  This is unfortunately due to our GUIDs being analyzed fields. I could potentially delete and reinsert the hyphens appropriately if we care to avoid that and are willing to absorb a bit of a kludge.~ Edit: The template change is unnecessary, because we don't actually query the field, just retrieve and modify it directly.\r\n\r\n~I owe a test plan for this, along with a couple unit tests (particularly around grouping, and shifting the status of the meta alert and ensuring queries work as expected).  Having said that, it should be fairly testable now on full dev, just by creating a couple meta alerts with a couple child alerts and running appropriate searches.~ Edit: A test plan is further down, and integration test cases have been added for grouping and for status changes. Testing can also be done by creating a couple meta alerts with child alerts and running appropriate searches.\r\n\r\n~Also definitely owe some documentation, particularly if we need to keep the field in the templates (and add it as a requirement).~ Edit: Some docs added, can add more if we want them.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

running the Profiler on a cluster that has multiple nodes and is secured by Kerberos, it was observed that the HBaseBolt was unable to write to HBase.  The Storm worker running the HBaseBolt logged the following exception.  This does not occur all the time and does not occur in all environments.\r\n```\r\n2017-10-19 14:51:00.146 o.a.h.h.i.AbstractRpcClient [ERROR] SASL authentication failed. \r\nThe most likely cause is missing or invalid credentials. Consider 'kinit'.\r\njavax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the `topology.auto-credentials` property needs to be set on the Profiler topology when running in a Kerberized environment.  This is similar to how the other topologies, like Enrichment, are already configured.\r\n\r\nAfter finding this, the big mystery for me was why this bug did not cause this issue in all kerberized environments, all the time.  Surely this miss should break the Profiler when running in any Kerberized environment and so should have been caught sooner.\r\n\r\nThe problem is obviously that a ticket cannot be found to authenticate when attempting to flush profile measurements to HBase. Due to this configuration miss, the Profiler topology itself is not able to generate Kerberos tickets for authentication.  At the same time, if the ticket cache on the worker node is already populated with a valid ticket, then this issue will not occur.  The ticket cache can be populated if another process generates a ticket or a user manually kinits on the same node.\r\n\r\nThis explains why the problem occurs sporadically and only in some environments.  This issue is less likely to occur in an environment, like Full Dev, where there are fewer, more active nodes.  In this case, it is likely that some other process or user already pre-populated the ticket cache.  In a larger, multi-node cluster, the ticket cache is less likely to be populated.  \r\n\r\nThat's my working theory at least.  Feel free to refute.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this by applying the fix in a 12 node Metron cluster.  This fixed the problem and allowed the Profiler to write to HBase.  I also tested this in Full Dev on both plain vanilla mode and after kerberization.\r\n\r\nTo test this change, follow these steps.\r\n1. Stand-up Full Dev and run the Metron Service Check.\r\n1. Using Ambari change the profiler duration from 15 minutes to 1 minute.  Then restart the Profiler.\r\n1. Create a simple Profile [following these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#deploying-profiles-with-the-stellar-shell).\r\n1. Wait a few minutes for the Profiler to gather data and flush.\r\n1. In the Stellar REPL, run `PROFILE_GET` to retrieve the data from HBase.  Ensure that data can be retrieved.\r\n1. Kerberize the cluster and run the Metron Service Check.\r\n1. Update the Bro sensor stub at `/opt/sensor-stubs/bin/start-bro-stub` and include `--security-protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT` as an argument to the `kafka-console-producer.sh` command.  Then run the script in a terminal so that data is flowing through Metron.  Also see [this for more information.](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/Kerberos-manual-setup.md#push-data)\r\n1. Wait a few minutes for the Profiler to gather data and flush.\r\n1. In the Stellar REPL, run `PROFILE_GET` to retrieve the data from HBase.  Ensure that new data is being written, post-kerberization.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently the Alerts UI service starts up before any of the Metron services does. Ideally, it should be started after the Metron REST service. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to update role_command_order.json in the Ambari Mpack so that Alerts UI starts after Metron REST service. This commit also adds the other Alerts UI dependency to other service checks.\r\n\r\n**Steps to verify**\r\n- Build mpack and start Ambari wizard based installation\r\n- Verify that the Alerts UI service starts after the Metron REST service has started.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the ElasticsearchMetaalertDao class (description is in the Jira).  I verified it in full dev using the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Search for alerts in an index (you need a couple guids) with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/searchUsingPOST endpoint.  I used the alerts_ui_e2e data set that can be created with `https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts/e2e/mock-data/setup.sh`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"from\": 0,\r\n    \"indices\": [\r\n      \"alerts_ui_e2e\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"query\": \"*\",\r\n    \"size\": 5\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. Pick a couple guids from the previous step and use the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/createUsingPOST endpoint to create a metaalert:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"groups\": [\r\n      \"string\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"guidToIndices\": {\r\n      \"c4c5e418-3938-099e-bb0d-37028a98dca8\": \"alerts_ui_e2e\",\r\n      \"fa91598f-51b2-2b60-11f2-6fbabc162b7e\": \"alerts_ui_e2e\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n3. Use the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/searchUsingPOST endpoint to see validate the metaalert you created in the previous step:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"from\": 0,\r\n    \"indices\": [\r\n      \"metaalert\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"query\": \"*\",\r\n    \"size\": 5\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n4. Update one of the alerts with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/update-controller/patchUsingPATCH endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"guid\": \"c4c5e418-3938-099e-bb0d-37028a98dca8\",\r\n    \"index\": \"alerts_ui_e2e_index\",\r\n    \"patch\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"op\": \"add\",\r\n        \"path\": \"/comments\",\r\n        \"value\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"comment\": \"aaa\",\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1508251594109\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"comment\": \"aaa\",\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1508251398188\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"comment\": \"abcd\",\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1508251201985\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"comment\": \"ccc\",\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1508244721089\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"comment\": \"c123\",\r\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1508244381778\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n5. Rerun the metadata search with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/searchUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"from\": 0,\r\n    \"indices\": [\r\n      \"metaalert\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"query\": \"*\",\r\n    \"size\": 5\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe alert you updated should also have the same update within the metaalert.  Both alerts should also be present.\r\n\r\nA couple of things I want to point out:\r\n- I ran into a NoSuchMethod error and had to remove an old jackson dependency from metron-elasticsearch pom.xml.  It was a pretty old dependency and I haven't seen any issues since.\r\n- I added a \"guid\" field to MetaAlertCreateResponse class.  I believe this makes it more useful when waiting on a metaalert create to propagate.\r\n- It was convenient to include both the patch and replace operations in the same test.  I can split these out if desired (it will make the test more verbose and add a duplicate test setup).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

part of #799, I improved the Ambari Service Check for Metron.

Contributor Comments\r\nThe purpose of the PR is to provide GUI for grouping multiple alerts into a meta alert, the rest api for this is already available via [METRON-1158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1158)\r\n\r\nThe current implementation has following features\r\n\r\n-  Meta alert can be created from the tree view of alerts \r\n-  Meta alerts can be viewed in the table view \r\n   -  The meta alert has a link icon on the left to denote that it is a meta alert\r\n   -  The meta alert has a expand/collapse icon to see all the alerts within it\r\n   -  The meta alert has a cumulative score (more on how this score is calculated is available in the original ticket)\r\n-  Support to add/remove an alert to the meta alert from the table view\r\n-  Change the state of meta alert\r\n-  Add comments to a meta alert\r\n-  Option to name a meta alert (This is just a convenience to refer to alerts)\r\n\r\n**Caveats**\r\nThe meta alert index is deleted and recreated few times by e2e test's. I ensured that the index remains available irrespective of the tests succeeding/failing. Just wanted to bring it up.\r\n\r\n**Limitations**\r\n\r\n- Meta alerts cannot be viewed in the tree view\r\n- Adding comments/Status change is restricted to just meta alerts. You cannot perform these actions on alerts contained in meta alert\r\n- A meta alert can contain only 999 alerts\r\n- Delete of the entire meta alert is not supported yet\r\n\r\n**Next**\r\n - It will be nice to have a notification when entities are changed in the UI\r\n\r\nI noticed that search on GUID was not working before I fixed it in this PR.\r\n\r\n~E2E tests are incoming I wanted to check if the community has any suggestion on this.~\r\n\r\n~PS: I had to comment one of the test cases since sort by guid is broke. I will raise a ticket for it~\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31682771-b9deb6da-b398-11e7-8681-6696fdcd1b6c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31682796-cc5236f2-b398-11e7-8db0-7233b35ba7b8.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31682824-dda3c02e-b398-11e7-9369-119587041262.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31682846-ee2451fc-b398-11e7-998e-c4f441048ffe.png)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR primarily fixes filtering on metaalert status but also includes a couple other minor fixes as well.  The nested query was moved to accompany a normal query string query (both are now 'should' clauses under a boolQuery) so that a filter will match on either a top level alert field and a nested alert field in a metaalert.  There was also a regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/793 that causes a search with the index set to \"metaalert\" to not match because '_index* is now appended instead of just '*'.  This PR fixes that by changing the \"metaalert\" index to \"metaalert_index\" and adds a test case to catch it in the future.\r\n\r\nThis has been validated by running the unit/integration tests and in full dev.  To test in full dev, create a couple metaalerts with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/meta-alert-controller/createUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"guidToIndices\": {\"4c732cb0-05cc-bdb4-9898-886a93129aba\":\"index_name\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"guidToIndices\": {\"c4c5e418-3938-099e-bb0d-37028a98dca8\":\"index_name\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA search on metaalerts with the http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/search-controller/searchUsingPOST endpoint:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"metaalert\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\nshould return both metaalerts:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 2,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n   ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen patch one of them to set the status to 'inactive':\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"guid\": \"fea984ad-63d3-4c8c-9bf4-aa9da11eea2b\",\r\n  \"index\": \"metaalert_index\",\r\n  \"patch\": [{\r\n    \"op\":\"add\",\r\n    \"path\":\"/status\",\r\n    \"value\":\"inactive\"\r\n   }],\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow a search should only return the active metaalert:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 1,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n   ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFiltering metaalerts by child alert fields should also work correctly:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"metaalert\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"alert.ip_dst_addr:62.75.195.236 AND alert.host:62.75.195.236\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWe currently cannot represent map literals in stellar where the keys are conditionals. For instance, the expression `{ x < 10 : 'info' }` cannot be parsed currently and it should do.

PR enhances the Metron 'Service Check' functionality in the MPack.  The Service Check is an easy way for a user to know if their Metron cluster is healthy.  The Service Check can be run manually from within Ambari.  It is also automatically executed after kerberization.\r\n\r\nIn the current version of the Service Check, healthy means the Parser and Indexing topologies are running.  This PR enhances that to validate all of the install actions that occur across each of the Metron services. These checks include the following.\r\n* Kafka topics, user permissions, group permissions\r\n* HBase tables, column families, and user permissions\r\n* HDFS resources like the grok patterns and geo database\r\n* Ensures all Metron topologies are running\r\n* Ensures the web-based resources are responding\r\n\r\nI added considerable logging so that if a check does fail, a user will have a reasonable chance to understand why.  Ambari doesn't give me an easy way to tell a user \"hey, this is the problem!\", so the user still has to go through the output of the Service Check in the Operations Panel to know why the Service Check failed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* I manually tested each of the checks by, for example, deleting a Kafka topic then running the Service Check.  This can be repeated for all of the different types of checks that I outlined above.\r\n* I tested the Service Check on a fresh deployment of Full Dev.\r\n* I then kerberized Full Dev and again validated the Service Check\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe Alerts UI currently hard-codes the set of indices. It would be preferred to use the REST API to get a list of index names for a given writer (e.g. elasticsearch, solr, hdfs).\r\nThis functions in the following way:\r\n* If an index config exists, then the index name will be returned. If unspecified, then the sensor name is used\r\n* If a parser exists and an index does NOT exist, then it will be included.\r\n* If the writer is disabled in the index config, then it will NOT be included.\r\n\r\nTest plan in the comments!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a time-range selector for search bar in alerts-ui. The time-range selectors have the following features\r\n\r\n- The time range selector is present next to the search box in the UI\r\n- The default value for time-range selector is epoc start to the year 2100 \r\n- Selecting the time-range button shows the options to select a 'Time Range' or select 'Quick Presets'\r\n  - Quick Presets allows you select fixed presets \r\n  - Time Range option shows a date time picker where users can select date and time to query for alerts\r\n- Selecting a preset or selecting the 'APPLY' button on Time Range would hide the pane and trigger search\r\n- The Date Time Button next to search button shows the selected time range and the time range that is used for the query\r\n- If user click's on timestamp on the table or enter a timestamp in the search query the Time Range selector is disabled and the selected value is not used in search\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31381910-8c43be20-add3-11e7-8e3f-28fdaa5580e3.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15019012/31381935-9ab31da2-add3-11e7-802c-bacede43d82b.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Launch the UI on full-dev or any other platform, all the above functionality can be tested on it\r\n-  E2E tests are available for testing the UI\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently, our bolts use a TreeCache to capture and update internal state. The REST API, on the other hand, polls zookeeper every time a request is made to retrieve a configuration, a poll model. Rather than do this, it would be better to share an abstraction between the two pieces of infrastructure to enable the REST API to be backed by a TreeCache, which will prevent zookeeper from being abused and migrate it to a push model.\r\n\r\nTesting instruction to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

ElasticsearchDAO can errantly query the wrong indices under certain conditions. This can occur when there are at least two different sensors that have been configured with a similar name prefix.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the case when the user has created two different sensors; \"snort\" and \"snort_v2\".  When the user attempts to query the \"snort\" index in Elasticsearch, the query generated by the ElasticsearchDAO will hit both of these indices which is unexpected.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nPreviously the `ElasticsearchDao` would append a simple `*` to the index name.  If the user had created a sensor \"test\" and another sensor \"test_v2\", then the wildcard logic would result in a pattern of `test*` when the user searches against the first sensor.  This pattern would unexpectedly also include data from the \"test_v2\" sensor.\r\n\r\nThe code was changed so that after wildcarding the index, it results in a pattern like `test_index*`.  Since \"_index\" is automatically appended by Metron, it can be used as a delimiter.  This will ensure that only the proper indices are searched.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**  The name of the meta-alerts index was also changed from `metaalerts` to `metaalert_index`.  The new wildcard strategy would not work with the previous meta-alerts naming convention.  The simple way to address this was to rename the meta-alerts index.  This new name also more closely matches the way we name other indices.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo manually test this specific condition, do the following in a Metron environment.\r\n1. Configure a sensor called \"test\".\r\n2. Allow telemetry to be consumed and indexed in Elasticsearch.\r\n3. Create a second sensor called \"test_v2\".\r\n4. Allow telemetry to be consumed and indexed in Elasticsearch.\r\n5. Pass in a simple query such as the following.  Ensure that only data from the first sensor \"test\" is returned.  No data should be returned from \"test_v2\".\r\n    ```\r\n      {\r\n       \"indices\": [\"test\"],\r\n       \"query\": \"*\",\r\n       \"from\": 4,\r\n       \"size\": 3,\r\n      \"sort\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"field\": \"timestamp\",\r\n         \"sortOrder\": \"desc\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ```\r\n**UPDATE:**  The Alerts UI should also be tested to ensure there are no regressions.  I was able to perform queries and use the Alerts UI as before.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of Global configuration is available ahead of the enrichment and listed here:\r\nhttps://metron.apache.org/current-book/metron-platform/metron-common/index.html\r\nGlobal config is used for validation of the fields.\r\nEnrichment is used for fields enrichment and probably can also be used for validation of the fields (which is not covered in the doc).\r\nFrom available doc I can see that they serve two different purposes.\r\n\r\nSo, I don't see any reason to mention global config in enrichment description.

Contributor Comments\r\nThe Jira has all the description of the issue. \r\nIn addition, the e2e test for removing search chip was consistently failing provided a small fix for it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\n- Login to alerts UI\r\n- Click on the pause button for alerts polling\r\n- Select an alert, this will open the details pane for the selected alert\r\n- Change the Alerts status by selecting the button on the top (Ex: ESCALATE, NEW, OPEN etc)\r\n- Close the deatils pane by clicking on the close icon\r\n- Thought the status of alert is persisted, the status field in list view is not updated (This is fixed in the PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR separates sensor name and sensor Kafka topic in both the REST app as well as the Management UI.  The SensorParserConfigController [POST](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/sensor-parser-config-controller/saveUsingPOST_5) endpoint now accepts a `name` path variable that represents the sensor name and the [getAll](http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#!/sensor-parser-config-controller/findAllUsingGET_1) endpoint now returns a map with the sensor name as the key and config as the value (was just a list before).\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  To verify, log in to the Management UI and create or edit a sensor.  There should now be separate inputs for sensor name and Kafka topic.  Editing one should not affect the other and vice-versa.  The Kafka topic field should function the same as it did before.  There was a significant refactor required so the Management UI should be tested to ensure all the features still work and no regressions were introduced.\r\n\r\nThe REST endpoints should also function normally and include the new behavior mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nUntil we get METRON-777 in, it'd be nice to have a simple ability using the normal storm functionality to enable users to provide custom parsers without forking Metron. This should be done via simply creating a jar with their code (and bundled dependencies) and have it picked up and available to the REST Service (and consequently the management UI) as well as the start_parser_topology.sh command.\r\n\r\nThis should be minimal movement as we have a more robust solution coming with METRON-777.\r\n\r\nTo test this, please look at and execute the examples in the 3rdPartyParsers.md document included as part of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull
