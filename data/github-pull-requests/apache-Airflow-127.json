In addition, I modified the scripts/docker/entrypoint_ci.sh file to pull up a local FTP server in ci in order to perform these tests. I have made sure to follow the suggested format for adding new airflow operators from [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst).\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is approved and merged, I will add the `FTPSOperator` as

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

(e.g. a load balancer is expecting the airflow-webserver to listen on port 31000, and it's set up via Terraform, so I'd rather be able to specify a known port in Terraform beforehand rather than have to grab a new port every time I build Airflow)\r\n\r\nTested locally on minikube with the following values.yaml override. \r\n```\r\nwebserver:\r\n    service:\r\n      type: NodePort\r\n      ports:\r\n        - name: airflow-ui\r\n          port: 80\r\n          targetPort: airflow-ui\r\n          nodePort: 31000\r\n```\r\n\r\nCluster comes up successfully with airflow-webserver service listening on expected nodePort.

K8S tests when run in parallel for multiple versions require:\r\n\r\na) vast amount of memory to keep all the cluster running\r\nb) extra time to startup for all k8s tests\r\n\r\nThis caused a problem when tests in CI were split into separate\r\nsteps - because we had to create all clusters before we run tests\r\neven if we limited parallelism.\r\n\r\nBy using \"depth-first\" mode, we can run complete tests (with\r\ncluster creation and deletion) in parallel with limited parallelism\r\nwithout having to create all clusters upfront.\r\n\r\nWe now add the `run-complete-tests` command that does all the\r\nsteps in one function - which makes it much nicer to parallelise\r\nwithout using too much resources.\r\n\r\nThere had to be a few fixes done to make it happen.\r\n\r\n* Failure in CI for K8S jobs produced really long logs that\r\n  were next to impossible to analyse any problems (for example\r\n  problems involved with lack of memory or with overwhelming K8S\r\n  with too many requests when there were multiple clusters.\r\n  When we combined multiple steps in one output it made the logs\r\n  absolutely unusable.\r\n\r\n* Verbose moda has been disabled because it was creating too much\r\n  noise (not that bad as resource dumps, but still lots of it).\r\n\r\n* The resource dumps from K8S are now dumped to separate files.\r\n  Those resource dumps can be downloaded separately as they are uploaded\r\n  as artifacts in case of failure.\r\n\r\nThere were also few fixes to kubernetes tests to make them more stable\r\nand debuggable:\r\n\r\n* Assertion which was thrown in \"setUp\" of K8S test base did not give\r\n  too much information about what the problem was so it has been now\r\n  replaced with a much more user-friendly message showing the actual\r\n  reason (could not check health of the webserver) and\r\n  you can see the root cause alongside the error.\r\n\r\n* Few tests in itest_kubernetes_pod_poperator were using fixed path for\r\n  local temp file that caused intermittent failures of the tes when run\r\n  in parallell.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is adding the ability for the `download_file` method to keep the original file name of the file as it is on S3.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the method generates a hardcoded temp file, as shown here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/d600cbd5fe9f0cd7101ff572190a8e5e64110e22/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/s3.py#L905-L906\r\n\r\nAs the original ticket states, sometimes users need to keep the file name as it is on S3. To accomplish this, I've added the parameter `preserve_file_name`, which if set to `True`, will rename the temporary file name to the name of the S3 object that we downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe default

found several places where the code is awkward (although technically correct) and decided to change them. There should be no change in functionality. A few things are involved:\r\n\r\n1. The `expand_mapped_literals` closure is declaring a `sequence` argument that is always `None`. Remove it.\r\n2. The `run_time_mapped_ti_count` method is never used in isolation, but combined with `parse_time_mapped_ti_count`. We should just combine the calls—actually, the run-time variant already covers the parse-time variant, so the latter call can simply be removed.\r\n3. The `TaskInstance` import in `_revise_mapped_task_indexes` is redundant (the class is already imported globally) and is removed.\r\n4.

fixups.","created_at":"2022-10-05T08:23:38Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T07:36:31Z","closed_at":"2022-10-11T01:32:01Z","merged_at":"2022-10-11T01:32:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2d872481e4075669eca35849431139af75b8c07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172802142,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAyMTQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:misc/internal","name":"type:misc/internal","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

Do not use `get_connection_form_widgets` and user should specified in extra as a dictionary\r\n2.

#26802\n\nAs part of 2.3.3 we added redaction to output from the tasks test\ncommand, but unfortunately that broke using a debugger with this error:\n\n```\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/pdb.py\", line 262, in user_line\n    self.interaction(frame, None)\n  File \"/home/ash/.virtualenvs/airflow/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pdb.py\", line 231, in interaction\n    self._cmdloop()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/pdb.py\", line 322, in _cmdloop\n    self.cmdloop()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/cmd.py\", line 126, in cmdloop\n    line = input(self.prompt)\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer\n```\n\n(ipdb has a similar but different error)\n\nThe \"fix\" is to assign a fileno attribute to the object. `input()` needs\nthis to write the prompt. It feels like a \"bug\" that it doesn't work\nwithout it, but as this class is only used in `tasks test` this is a\nsafe change\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

warning was invisible before 2.4 due to a bug in our logging config (fixed by commit 7363e35) and AIP-45 which suddenly made this appear.\r\n\r\nThe problem was being caused by set_xcomargs_dependencies being called once for each class in the hierarchy, and each of them doing the same logic.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to look at the _actual_ function of `self.__init__` and compare it to the function we're about to call so that we don't set dependencies until we have finished the \"outer\" most class's apply_defaults invocation.","created_at":"2022-09-30T13:16:38Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T16:03:32Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T16:03:08Z","merged_at":"2022-09-30T16:03:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"d77f0563b403ae9e1a92e8e9e998a1142bb6f359","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

I was wondering whether adding a little 'breakdown' of the commands on the [official Helm Chart docs ](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html)might help? \r\n\r\nEspecially for people who are completely new to the tool?\r\n\r\nAs in:\r\n\r\n### Installing the Chart\r\n`helm repo add apache-airflow https://airflow.apache.org\r\nhelm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace airflow --create-namespace`\r\n\r\n**Explanation**:\r\n`helm repo add apache-airflow https://airflow.apache.org`\r\n- `helm repo add` is a command to add a chart repository\r\n\r\n`helm upgrade --install airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace airflow --create-namespace`\r\n\r\n**Explanation**\r\n- `helm upgrade` is a command to upgrade a release\r\n- the first 'airflow' argument is the release name\r\n- 'apache-airflow/airflow' is the Helm Chart\r\n- the second 'airflow' argument is the namespace\r\n\r\n### Upgrading the Chart\r\n\r\n`helm upgrade airflow apache-airflow/airflow --namespace airflow`\r\n- `helm upgrade` is a command to upgrade a release\r\n- the first 'airflow' argument is the release name\r\n- 'apache-airflow/airflow' is the Helm Chart\r\n- the second 'airflow' argument is the namespace\r\n\r\n### Uninstalling the Chart\r\n\r\n`helm delete airflow --namespace airflow`\r\n\r\n**Explanation**\r\n- `helm delete` is a command to delete a release (it has now been renamed to `helm uninstall`)\r\n- the first 'airflow' argument is the release name\r\n- the second 'airflow' argument is the namespace\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-30T12:02:29Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T00:12:08Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T00:12:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee9364fcade17e659006ecd645928fa35461b60c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

investigating #26599 and the change from AIP-45, I noticed that these warning messages weren't new! The only thing that was new was that we started seeing them.\n\nThis is because the logger for BaseOperator and all subclasses is `airflow.task.operators`, and the `airflow.task` logger is not configured (with `set_context()`) until we have a TaskInstance, so it just dropped all messages on the floor!\n\nThis changes it so that log messages are propagated to parent loggers by default, but when we configure a context (and thus have a file to write to) we stop that. A similar change was made for the `airflow.processor` (but that is unlikely to suffer the same fate)","created_at":"2022-09-29T15:14:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T07:58:47Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T13:08:41Z","merged_at":"2022-09-30T13:08:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7363e35c9dbb9860eabf2444307f4d6f8140ab70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

of Airflow 2.3 it's no longer necessary to use the `extra__<conn_type>__` prefix for connection extras.\r\n\r\nWe're bumping min airflow version to 2.3 now, so we can remove the prefix.\r\n\r\nWe handle back compat with method get_field.\r\n\r\nAnd in version 2.5 we will support no prefix in `get_ui_field_behaviors` (pr https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/26995), so we prepare for that here.  What we do is update the placeholders to remove the prefix but add in the logic (which in 2.5 is added to providers manager) to add the prefix.  This way all we need to do when min airflow version is 2.5 is remove the decorator.  And in the meantime, we don't ever have to see the
