See also Bug Fixes below.</li>\n<li>When using iterators with BlobDB, it is now possible to load large values on an on-demand basis, i.e. only if they are actually needed by the application. This can save I/O in use cases where the values associated with certain keys are not needed. For more details, see the new read option <code>allow_unprepared_value</code> and the iterator API <code>PrepareValue</code>.</li>\n<li>Add a new file ingestion option <code>IngestExternalFileOptions::fill_cache</code> to support not adding blocks from ingested files into block cache during file ingestion.</li>\n<li>The option <code>allow_unprepared_value</code> is now also supported for multi-column-family iterators (i.e. <code>CoalescingIterator</code> and <code>AttributeGroupIterator</code>).</li>\n<li>When a file with just one range deletion (standalone range deletion file) is ingested via bulk loading, it will be marked for compaction. During compaction, this type of files can be used to directly filter out some input files that are not protected by any snapshots and completely deleted by the standalone range deletion file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is the purpose of the change\r\nStormExecutor: adding an unit test to check if the RotatingMap' `rotate` is called only once when timing out tuples.\r\n\r\n`StormExecutor` requires a considerable effort to mock and the `pending` map (which is RotatingMap) is an internal attribute. JUnit's reflection was used to mock the RotationMap and verify how many times `rotate` was called.\r\n\r\nThis test is far from optimal and I'm not a fan of using reflection, but will make it easier to detect regressions. \r\nThe test should be refactored in the future.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, refactored the changes introduced in https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/3828: `boolean isSpout = this instanceof SpoutExecutor;` should not be in Executor.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen deploying or killing a topology in a distributed cluster, we occasionally encounter downtime on the Nimbus machines.\r\nThis issue occurs due to a race condition when syncing the blobs. On some machines, the key we are trying to fetch information for during the process of creating the state in ZooKeeper for a recently downloaded blob might disappear. This results in a Thrift exception that is not being handled properly, causing the Nimbus process to crash.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses that issue, by handling the `KeyNotFoundException` error when creating the state in zookeeper.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-4154\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nCompiled the project, and tested the new version of the code in Nimbus machines, forcing Nimbus to download a non-existent key.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-13T12:46:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T16:50:05Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T16:50:05Z","merged_at":"2025-01-14T16:50:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"af4699946b1d2f599e5e08b5d3005aff0ee74a79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3833/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3833/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3833/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/statuses/bdc3a1362031de429032acd6706500d72805b5f8","head":{"label":"DiogoP98:STORM-4154-nimbus-downtime-during-topology-deployment","ref":"STORM-4154-nimbus-downtime-during-topology-deployment","sha":"bdc3a1362031de429032acd6706500d72805b5f8","user":{"login":"DiogoP98","id":27361931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzYxOTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27361931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98","html_url":"https://github.com/DiogoP98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":916076870,"node_id":"R_kgDONpo5Rg","name":"storm","full_name":"DiogoP98/storm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DiogoP98","id":27361931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzYxOTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27361931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98","html_url":"https://github.com/DiogoP98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DiogoP98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DiogoP98/storm","description":"Apache

This bug was introduced in version 9.4.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9.8.0 (10/25/2024)</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All non-<code>block_cache</code> options in <code>BlockBasedTableOptions</code> are now mutable with <code>DB::SetOptions()</code>. See also Bug Fixes below.</li>\n<li>When using iterators with BlobDB, it is now possible to load large values on an on-demand basis, i.e. only if they are actually needed by the application. This can save I/O in use cases where the values associated with certain keys are not needed. For more details, see the new read option <code>allow_unprepared_value</code> and the iterator API <code>PrepareValue</code>.</li>\n<li>Add a new file ingestion option <code>IngestExternalFileOptions::fill_cache</code> to support not adding blocks from ingested files into block cache during file ingestion.</li>\n<li>The option <code>allow_unprepared_value</code> is now also supported for multi-column-family iterators (i.e. <code>CoalescingIterator</code> and <code>AttributeGroupIterator</code>).</li>\n<li>When a file with just one range deletion (standalone range deletion file) is ingested via bulk loading, it will be marked for compaction. During compaction, this type of files can be used to directly filter out some input files that are not protected by any snapshots and completely deleted by the standalone range deletion file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>During file ingestion, overlapping files level assignment are done in multiple batches, so that they can potentially be assigned to lower levels other than always land on L0.</li>\n<li>OPTIONS file to be loaded by remote worker is now preserved so that it does not get purged by the primary host. A similar technique as how we are preserving new SST files from getting purged is used for this. min_options_file_numbers_ is tracked like pending_outputs_ is tracked.</li>\n<li>Trim readahead_size during scans so data blocks containing keys that are not in the same prefix as the seek key in <code>Seek()</code> are not prefetched when <code>ReadOptions::auto_readahead_size=true</code> (default value) and <code>ReadOptions::prefix_same_as_start = true</code></li>\n<li>Assigning levels for external files are done in the same way for universal compaction and leveled compaction. The old behavior tends to assign files to L0 while the new behavior will assign the files to the lowest level possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a longstanding race condition in SetOptions for <code>block_based_table_factory</code> options. The fix has some subtle behavior changes because of copying and replacing the TableFactory on a change with SetOptions, including requiring an Iterator::Refresh() for an existing Iterator to use the latest options.</li>\n<li>Fix under counting of allocated memory in the compressed secondary cache due to looking at the compressed block size rather than the actual memory allocated, which could be larger due to internal fragmentation.</li>\n<li><code>GetApproximateMemTableStats()</code> could return disastrously bad estimates 5-25% of the time. The function has been re-engineered to return much better estimates with similar CPU cost.</li>\n<li>Skip insertion of compressed blocks in the secondary cache if the lowest_used_cache_tier DB option is kVolatileTier.</li>\n<li>Fix an issue in level compaction where a small CF with small compaction debt can cause the DB to allow parallel compactions. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/13054\">#13054</a>)</li>\n<li>Several DB option settings could be lost through <code>GetOptionsFromString()</code>, possibly elsewhere as well. Affected options, now fixed:<code>background_close_inactive_wals</code>, <code>write_dbid_to_manifest</code>, <code>write_identity_file</code>, <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9.7.0 (09/20/2024)</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Make Cache a customizable class that can be instantiated by the object registry.</li>\n<li>Add new option <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only</code> that makes iterators generally safer when you might set a <code>prefix_extractor</code>. When <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only=true</code>, which is expected to be the future default, prefix seek is only used when <code>prefix_same_as_start</code> or <code>auto_prefix_mode</code> are set.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter bumping our Storm services from Storm 1 to Storm 2, we faced an issue where some components fail to load through the UI.\r\n\r\n500 Server Error\r\norg.apache.storm.thrift.TApplicationException: Internal error processing getComponentPageInfo\r\n \r\nFindings:\r\nWe verified that the getComponentPageInfo method works correctly for Spouts and Bolts with names that do not contain spaces.\r\nHowever, it fails for components with names that contain spaces.\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nThe issue lies on how the parameter componentId is being passed. For example, in the StatsUtils.componentType method:\r\n\r\npublic static String componentType(StormTopology topology, String compId) {\r\n    if (compId == null) {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Map<String, Bolt> bolts = topology.get_bolts();\r\n    if (Utils.isSystemId(compId) || bolts.containsKey(compId)) {\r\n        return ClientStatsUtil.BOLT;\r\n    }\r\n    return ClientStatsUtil.SPOUT;\r\n}\r\n \r\n\r\nError Scenario:\r\n\r\nWhen accessing the component page of a Bolt named Test Error, the compId value is \"Test+Error\".\r\nHowever, in the bolts map, the component key is stored as \"Test Error\".\r\nThis mismatch prevents the bolts map from finding the component, leading the method to incorrectly return the SPOUT value for a Bolt.\r\n\r\nOn this PR we're decoding the componentId string so it will match the correct value.\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nCompiled the project, copied the jar into my machine and verified that the UI is now loading the components for names with spaces","created_at":"2025-01-10T11:44:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T14:22:46Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T12:16:50Z","merged_at":"2025-01-10T12:16:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"457194d18978c22fe35c4ea4453099a1c65caf88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/statuses/bbdf06f83a429aa76102eb5b0d89a42facbf60b7","head":{"label":"paxadax:Storm-4148-fix-UI-throwing-error-on-Component-Page","ref":"Storm-4148-fix-UI-throwing-error-on-Component-Page","sha":"bbdf06f83a429aa76102eb5b0d89a42facbf60b7","user":{"login":"paxadax","id":77935294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTM1Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77935294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax","html_url":"https://github.com/paxadax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":914821416,"node_id":"R_kgDONocRKA","name":"storm","full_name":"paxadax/storm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paxadax","id":77935294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTM1Mjk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77935294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax","html_url":"https://github.com/paxadax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paxadax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paxadax/storm","description":"Apache

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

href=\"https://github.com/google/auto/releases\">com.google.auto.service:auto-service's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>auto-service-1.1.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No functional changes.</li>\n<li>Dependencies updated.</li>\n<li>Some minor code improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/auto/compare/auto-service-1.1.0...auto-service-1.1.1\">https://github.com/google/auto/compare/auto-service-1.1.0...auto-service-1.1.1</a></p>\n<h2>AutoCommon 1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>com.google.auto.common</code> is annotated for null-safety. (9d79ce1e)</li>\n<li>Add String and TypeElement versions of auto-common APIs that currently take in Class. (dec3bf0e)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AutoService 1.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoService now verifies by default that the annotated class does indeed implement the interface in <code>@AutoServce</code>. Previously this only happened when compiling with <code>-Averify=true</code>. The verification can be disabled either by compiling with <code>-Averify=false</code> or by adding <code>@SuppressWarnings(&quot;AutoService&quot;)</code> to the annotated class. (965e89328)</li>\n<li>The <code>@AutoService</code> annotation can no longer be applied to an interface or abstract class. This new verification can also be disabled in the same way. (591731c32)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>AutoFactory 1.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoFactory now recognizes and generates both <code>javax.inject</code> and <code>jakarta.inject</code>. If <code>jakarta.inject</code> is on the classpath then it will be used, and otherwise <code>javax.inject</code>. A new compiler option <code>-Acom.google.auto.factory.InjectApi</code> can be set to either <code>javax</code> or <code>jakarta</code> to force the use of one or the other. (67772b26d)</li>\n<li>There is now a way to add annotations to generated AutoFactory classes. See the javadoc for <code>@AutoFactory.AnnotationsToApply</code>. (b2a1c0885)</li>\n<li>The exception message for a null value now indicates not only which number argument it is but also how many arguments there are in total. This may lead to a small increase in code size.

[com.google.code.gson:gson](https://github.com/google/gson) from 2.10.1 to 2.11.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/releases\">com.google.code.gson:gson's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Gson 2.11.0</h2>\n<h1>Most important changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added default ProGuard / R8 rules (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2397\">#2397</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2420\">#2420</a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/sgjesse\"><code>@​sgjesse</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2448\">#2448</a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/sfreilich\"><code>@​sfreilich</code></a>)<br />\nIf you are using ProGuard or R8 (for example for Android projects) you might not need any special Gson configuration anymore if your classes have a no-args constructor and use <code>@SerializedName</code> for their fields.</li>\n<li>On Android, Gson now requires API level 21 or newer</li>\n<li>Added new <code>Strictness</code> API (<a href=\"https://github.com/marten-voorberg\"><code>@​marten-voorberg</code></a> &amp; fellow students, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2437\">#2437</a>)<br />\nSome of Gson's API is still lenient by default, but you can now use the newly added methods <code>GsonBuilder#setStrictness</code>, <code>JsonReader#setStrictness</code> and <code>JsonWriter#setStrictness</code> with <code>Strictness.STRICT</code> to override this behavior and to instead strictly adhere to the JSON specification when parsing.</li>\n<li>New <code>FormattingStyle</code> class to allow configuring line breaks in JSON output (<a href=\"https://github.com/mihnita\"><code>@​mihnita</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2231\">#2231</a>)<br />\nCan be set using <code>GsonBuilder#setFormattingStyle</code> and <code>JsonWriter#setFormattingStyle</code>.</li>\n<li><code>TypeToken</code> can no longer capture type variables by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2376\">#2376</a>)<br />\nThis was previously a common source of issues. The newly thrown exception refers to a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md#typetoken-type-variable\">Troubleshooting Guide article</a> which explains this in more detail and provides suggestions for updating affected code.</li>\n<li>Added serialization support for anonymous and local classes with a custom adapter (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2498\">#2498</a>)<br />\nThis affects for example <code>List</code> implementations returned by libraries such as Guava which are implemented as anonymous class, which were previously serialized as <code>null</code>. Anonymous and local classes without custom adapter will still be serialized as <code>null</code>.</li>\n<li>Added dependency on <code>com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations</code><br />\nYour project can use Maven or Gradle dependency exclusions to remove the transitive error_prone_annotations dependency from Gson. Or if you are manually maintaining dependencies as JARs in your project you can omit error_prone_annotations. And it should still work correctly.<br />\nBut Gson itself does declare it as a required dependency, and if you don't perform any custom configuration, then Maven or Gradle will by default try to download and use it.</li>\n<li>Many exception messages now refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md\">Troubleshooting Guide</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2357\">#2357</a>)<br />\nFeedback regarding the Troubleshooting Guide is appreciated!</li>\n<li>Officially documented that JVM languages other than Java might not be fully supported, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/README.md\">README</a>.</li>\n<li>Guarantee that <code>JsonElement#toString</code> produces JSON output (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2659\">#2659</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other changes</h1>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed incorrect <code>JsonPrimitive#equals</code> results for large <code>BigInteger</code> values (<a href=\"https://github.com/MaicolAntali\"><code>@​MaicolAntali</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2311\">#2311</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect <code>JsonPrimitive#equals</code> results for large <code>BigDecimal</code> values (<a href=\"https://github.com/MaicolAntali\"><code>@​MaicolAntali</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2364\">#2364</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>JsonReader</code> throwing <code>NumberFormatException</code> instead of <code>MalformedJsonException</code> for malformed Unicode escape sequences (<a href=\"https://github.com/MaicolAntali\"><code>@​MaicolAntali</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2337\">#2337</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>TypeToken#getParameterized</code> returning bogus <code>ParameterizedType</code> for non-generic types (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2447\">#2447</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed Java Record adapter not working for GraalVM Native Image (<a href=\"https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus\"><code>@​eamonnmcmanus</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2465\">#2465</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>JsonWriter#name</code> not throwing exception when no JSON object is currently being written (<a href=\"https://github.com/shivam-sehgal\"><code>@​shivam-sehgal</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2475\">#2475</a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2476\">#2476</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>Gson#getDelegateAdapter</code> not working properly for <code>@JsonAdapter</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2435\">#2435</a>)<br />\nNote that <code>null</code> is now not allowed as <code>skipPast</code> value anymore, which was previously allowed but undocumented.</li>\n<li>Fixed <code>GsonBuilder</code> not rejecting type adapters for <code>Object</code> and <code>JsonElement</code>, whose default adapters cannot be overridden (<a href=\"https://github.com/sachinp97\"><code>@​sachinp97</code></a>; <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2479\">#2479</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed no limits being enforced when deserializing <code>BigDecimal</code> and <code>BigInteger</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2510\">#2510</a>)<br />\nThe new limits prevent potential performance problems when user code uses the deserialized numbers.
