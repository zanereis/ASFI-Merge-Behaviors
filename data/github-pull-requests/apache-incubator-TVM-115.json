the C++ side, the if_then_else will call BinaryOpMatchTypes, which will try to convert the dtypes of the inner expressions to be the same:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/d05893b3aaddb098780a2fbaf2d2af81bb50d393/src/lang/expr_operator.cc#L242\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, in the python side, there is no such conversion, which makes the behavior inconsistent. \r\nThe same issue occurs for power. Thus, fix by directly registering the APIs inside _make.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give an example of the inconsistent behavior, consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\na = tvm.var('a', dtype='float32')\r\nb = tvm.var('b', dtype='int32')\r\nc = tvm.if_then_else(a > 0, a, b)\r\nprint(c)\r\n```\r\nIn the original version, the result will be\r\n```\r\ntvm_if_then_else((a > 0f), a, b)\r\n```\r\nIf we use the C++ API, it will be the following, in which b will be automatically casted to float32.\r\n```\r\ntvm_if_then_else((a > 0f), a, float32(b))\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-24T00:27:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T18:45:24Z","closed_at":"2019-08-26T18:31:11Z","merged_at":"2019-08-26T18:31:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"283b0c3f7bdf4b9142ccdd1f8c1b3a4b8b86717f","assignee":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

the previous version, we have put too many duties to realization: transform the simulated graph; decide data type casting after `simulated_quantize`; for `add` operation, it also will decide the output scale and unify its operands. Things are quite complicated in this situation with many implicit rules. This PR would like to move those extra functions out of the realization procedure.\r\n\r\n- Insert `cast_hint` explicitly during annotation.  The `dtype` filed in `QRealizeExpr` has been removed.\r\n  Currently, `cast_hint` does two things: 1.It has been inserted during `Partition`, and simulated_quantize to INPUT will be inserted before it during annotation. This is for storing low-precision output of residual block. 2. It has been inserted during `Annotation`, and will be transformed to `cast` during realization. Before realization, it just pass the input through like `identity`, so will has no effect to the output before realization.\r\n\r\n- Modify annotate/realize rule for `addition`. \r\n  Previously, we will quantize operands of addition separately during annotation, then unify their scale during realization. This way has a lot burden since there exist many combinations of operands' kind. Currently, we will quantize operands into the same `dom_scale` by two sq but with the same `dom_scale` parameter. So that we only need to do identity transform during realization.\r\n- This PR also did some refactor work for the calibration part: thanks @vinx13 evaluation script for KL, the collect stats part has been moved into internal `collect_stats`. A new config  `calibration_mode` has been added.\r\n- Minor improvement: saturation for left_shift inside of the `QuantizeRealize`","created_at":"2019-08-23T23:23:52Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T20:47:18Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T03:50:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aaec863e62f58dcffd30d28d8118a1a76c007949","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":963830470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjM4MzA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20WIP","name":"status:

database APIs designed in AutoTVM will throw exceptions with Redis database in Python 3. The main reason is that Python 3 package `redis` returns values in `bytes` format instead of `str` so it cannot be manipulated by builtin string methods like `split`.\r\n\r\nThe original code uses `str(result)` to convert `bytes` to `str`, but this is not the right way:\r\n```python\r\nbval = b\"some strings\" # type(bval) -> <class 'byte'>\r\nsval = str(bval) # type(sval) -> <class 'str'>\r\nprint(sval)\r\n'b\\'some strings\\''\r\n```\r\nAs can be seen, `str` simply invokes `bytes.__str__()` and results in unnecessary `b\\'...\\'` characters. The right way to do so is using `decode` method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndval = bval.decode() # type(dval) -> <class 'str'>\r\nprint(dval)\r\n'some strings'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue and creates a new unit test to cover `filer` method which wasn't covered before. With the changes, the unit test passes for both `DummyDatabase` and `RedisDatabase` locally.\r\n\r\nOne remain issue could be the lack of unit tests for Redis database, but this requires changes of CI environment.","created_at":"2019-08-22T20:23:03Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T17:05:29Z","closed_at":"2019-08-28T17:04:13Z","merged_at":"2019-08-28T17:04:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"062f8cc42d084305d22b91ec44fb0afb502cfe80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

are 2 reasons for moving to C++\r\n\r\n* With python interface earlier, we had to call infer_type in the op python definition. This broke the nice abstraction that we have with Relay and QNN ops.\r\n* Working with different targets, I realized that we need to write QNN passes, that will work on the abstraction of QNN ops. For example, Intel needs the conv to be uint8 x int8. However, TFLite graphs can be uint8 x uint8. This can resolved by writing a legalize pass for QNN conv2d op for Intel machines, that will insert a requantize on the weight matrix to go from uint8 x int8. With earlier python interface, the ops were already getting lowered to relay ops, before I could even run this pass.\r\n\r\nPlease review @yzhliu @jackwish @FrozenGene @vinx13 @tqchen

unit test. This allows us to generate vectorized code for common pointwise operations, which is helpful on some platforms.

PR includes a rework of how topi handles resizing. Rather than have a call into a c++ implementation, it makes sense to have all resizing operations as tensor expressions as this allows easier customization and enables fast scheduling where appropriate (it's also much more readable).\r\n\r\nBesides adding a true tvm implementation of nearest_neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic resampling, I include a few minor changes that are important to note (and may be controversial): \r\n\r\n- align_corners now always defaults to True. The false setting literally only exists to support a tensorflow bug that has stayed around for backwards compatibility reasons and is being fully removed in the tf2.0 release. We shouldn't be propagating this bug by default. That said, all methods support align_corners=False when needed.\r\n\r\n- I toned down the size of one of the crop_and_resize tests as it was occasionally tripping correctness due to floating point arithmetic errors.\r\n\r\n- Although the c++ workflow is completely removed from relay, nnvm still uses it so I haven't completely cut it out of topi. If nnvm weren't deprecating soon I would be more motivated to make this change.\r\n\r\n- Bicubic resizing is supported and generates good looking images. However, I haven't found two bicubic implementations that produce the exact same results, tensorflow, PIL, and this implementation all produce visually similar but slightly different results for example. This makes testing a little complicated so it's not currently included.\r\n\r\n- Currently resize is always scheduled as injective (just like the previous version of resize), however this may not be optimal. I imagine a more efficient schedule could be created, especially for bicubic resizing which can be quite slow. \r\n\r\nI'm curious to know what the reviewers think of these above points and can

#3774 \r\n\r\nAdds support for `EQ` op in the deduce bound. \r\n\r\nThe main check required for `EQ` is that both LHS and RHS should be constant at the time of relaxing them. e.g. for `(i==j)` then, both `EvalSet` over \r\n`i` and `j` both should be a single point.  In other words, `EQ` condition can not be resolved if one of the operands is variable. \r\n\r\nSecondly, for `EQ` with multiplication where there is no perfect division, e.g `(4 * i == 10)` can not be solved because division truncation will change one of the operands. \r\n\r\nThis PR extends `DeduceBound` for `EQ` and adds unittests for the same. \r\n\r\nLoopPartition uses the deduce_bound and with `EQ` support, LoopPartition is also changed to partition based on `EQ` conditions. Unittest for the same is added.

PR implements simplification of some casts of constants in the rewrite simplifier. The use case I have in mind is conversion from boolean expressions to floats (`float32(i < j)` instead of `select(i < k, 1.0, 0.0)`). I restricted consts to be just 0 and 1 because I'm not sure about usefulness and safety of other values (0 and 1 should be safe for all types, except maybe for some custom types).\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces the `is_const_value` functions which is like `is_const_int`, but works for float expressions too. Besides this PR, it is also used in the tensor expression autodiff implementation.","created_at":"2019-08-12T14:40:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T15:28:29Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T15:28:29Z","merged_at":"2019-08-13T15:28:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbc5d15358b0d3c3d73397da48d02b921366123e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

PR adds a low-level device backend to [µTVM](#2563) (initial implementation [here](#3227)) that enables the use of any device which features a JTAG interface.  In order to do so, [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) is used to mediate a connection between µTVM and the device.  In particular, OpenOCD exposes a TCP socket, which µTVM connects to and uses to send [Tcl](https://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html) commands to the device.\r\n\r\nThere are still some unimplemented features:\r\n- [ ] Instructions for how to set up OpenOCD\r\n- [ ] A cleaner binutil interface\r\n- [ ] A better method for configuring the low-level device\r\n\r\nCC @Mutinifni @u99127 @liangfu

Issue - #2519\r\n\r\nCurrently, the TFLite parsed models fail for ARM devices. The reason is TFLite models are NHWC and we don't support NHWC layout in ARM. However, TF models (which are also NHWC), are able to run on ARM devices. This is because of TF parser adds layout transforms while parsing the graph (which is not a good idea as parsers should retain the framework layout).\r\n\r\nAs a first step, this PR adds a legalize function for conv2d for arm_cpu to add transposes before and after to use the NCHW layout. This gets the TFLite models working for ARM cpus.\r\n\r\nA follow-up work requires TF parser cleanup. Parsers should keep the frontend layout. So, we can add legalize for all the targets to fall back to NCHW for conv and then cleanup TF parser. (Let me know if I should open up a new Issue for tracking the tasks).\r\n\r\n@yzhliu @FrozenGene @apivovarov @kevinthesun @yongwww

(white-listed in tutorial until more models are supported): ResNet18_v2, ResNet34_v2,  ResNet50_v2, ResNet101_v2\r\n\r\nPerformance on `pynq` IoT platform: 371.68ms, 470.86ms, 662.13ms and 916.26ms

micro-op/insn buffer size to `1<<24` to avoid out of memory errors on the pynq\r\n\r\n[resolved]: getting quantization to pass on these models is pending on #3543 being merged.

PR adds two new operators that appear in many tensorflow graphs: mirrorpad and spacetodepth. SpaceToDepth can be implemented using TVM intrinsics and so is easily added to the relay tensorflow frontend. MirrorPadding (which includes reflect and symmetric padding around edges) is a little more involved and required adding a new relay operation and topi schedule. Both new operations have new tests against their tensorflow equivalents.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-06T20:12:30Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:13Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T00:48:10Z","merged_at":"2019-08-13T00:48:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bd9d4d5edf0a17ef0726166710024c3147def68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:
