functionality to shuffle HMS connections that way the requests to hms servers are load balanced.\r\n\r\nExisting logic picks the first connection out of all connections pertaining to a specific conn_id and uses it for for all requests that is sent via HiveMetastoreHook. This code change shuffles the connections and make sure same HMS connection / server is not used all the time HiveMetastoreHook is instantiated.

wanted to present a generic wrapper for CLI tools that uses only one binary file. It's a multi-call binary.  A multi-call binary is an executable program that performs the same job as more than one utility program. That means there is just a single binary, but that single binary acts like a large number of wrappers. \r\nCons:\r\n- This makes the code easier to maintain because it doesn't have duplicate code. In the previous implementation, the common parts between wrappers were duplicated. \r\n- We have fewer files. Instead of 7 * 2 +1 scripts, we only have one script\r\n- For me, the most important thing is that we don't generate scripts using scripts. It prevented code analysis by static code analysis tools. It's also error-prone. It's easy to forget to add an escape characters. We need to be very careful. \r\n\r\n\r\nTheis change includes fixes from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/9219\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n-

is my first PR, so pardon me if I missed any steps, but this proposed change is also _very_ simple. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `SystemsManagerParameterStoreBackend` `_get_secret` uses\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            response = self.client.get_parameter(\r\n                Name=ssm_path, WithDecryption=False\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this only allows for secrets to be stored in clear text. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the value to `WithDecryption=True`, which is backwards compatible with clear text values, but also supports KMS decryption in the API call.\r\n\r\nfor reference in the API docs:\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetParameter.html\r\n\r\n> WithDecryption\r\nReturn decrypted values for secure string parameters. This flag is ignored for String and StringList parameter types.\r\n>\r\n>Type: Boolean\r\n>\r\n>Required: No\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the test coverage and the documentation, I don't think there are any changes that need to be made. The are no behavior changes for users other than this will support a storage option and will natively support tools like [chamber cli tooling](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber)\r\n\r\nI guess there could be an argument made to update documentation stating this feature is now supported? \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above

the issue #9202 \r\n\r\n**File changed**: ``airflow/utils/process_utils.py``\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nSince python3.5, signals have become ``IntEnum`` instead of ``int``, therefore ``str(signal.SIGTERM)`` yields the string literal ``signal.SIGTERM`` instead of ``15``.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nconvert ``signal.SIGTERM`` to ``int`` first and then ``str``\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [x] Target Github ISSUE in description if exists\r\n- [x] Commits follow

pull request adds a tagging system for tasks/task instances similarly to dag tags. This allows filtering by tags in Task Instance view and Graph view. \r\n\r\nA new table, task_tag, is added with TaskInstance's composite primary key as a foreign key. Although having only dag_id and task_id as foreign keys would be sufficient, SQLite doesn't support a foreign key relationship over just a part of a composite primary key.

only reason I can think to not include `@everyminute` on `schedule_interval`, is to keep consistency against `cron`. As we can see, all other relevant shortcuts are already [there](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/dag-run.rst).\r\nBut they already are different (E.g. `@quarterly` and `@once` are not part of [cron](https://crontab.guru/) ).\r\nI suggest including `@everyminute` as part of `presets` to make it complete.\r\n\r\n**Testing code**\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator\r\n\r\nparams = {\r\n    'dag_id': 'test_minute',\r\n    'schedule_interval': '@everyminute',\r\n    'catchup': True,\r\n    'max_active_runs': 2,\r\n    'default_args': {\r\n        'owner': 'airflow',\r\n        'start_date': days_ago(1),\r\n        'retries': 2,\r\n        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG(**params) as dag:\r\n\r\n    task_minute = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id='task_minute',\r\n        bash_command=\"\"\"echo test \"\"\",\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    task_minute\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit**: The description has been changed from `@minutely` to `@everyminute` to comply with the suggestions on comments.\r\n\r\n**Sample output**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/84029746-78e2c380-a9c5-11ea-97a4-38298e4cd0fc.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/84029781-8b5cfd00-a9c5-11ea-9a59-b1e6513b30f9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake

fairly common to say whitelisting and blacklisting to describe\r\ndesirable and undesirable things in cyber security. Just because\r\nit is common doesn't mean it's right.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's an issue with the terminology. It only makes sense if\r\nyou equate white with 'good, permitted, safe' and black with 'bad,\r\ndangerous, forbidden'. There are some obvious problems with this.\r\n\r\nYou may not see why this matters. If you're not adversely affected by\r\nracial stereotyping yourself, then please count yourself lucky. For some\r\nof your friends and colleagues (and potential future colleagues), this\r\nreally is a change worth making.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, we will use 'allow list' and 'deny list' in place of\r\n'whitelist' and 'blacklist' wherever possible. Which, in fact, is\r\nclearer and less ambiguous. So as well as being more inclusive of all,\r\nthis is a net benefit to our understandability.\r\n\r\n(Words mostly borrowed

the issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9172\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\nWhen using DockerOperator and setting `auto_remove=True` data is not stored on xcom.\r\n\r\n**Root of the problem**\r\nWhen `auto_remove` is set to `True`, the container is removed [as It's done](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py#L260), after that, if `do_xcom_push=True` It tries to retrieve the [logs](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py#L266) at a moment that the container is potentially removed.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nSet \r\n```python\r\nauto_remove = False\r\n``` \r\nwhen creating the container, to always run without being removed and remove the container after running all the commands if `auto_remove=True`\r\n```python\r\nif self.auto_remove:\r\n    self.cli.remove_container(self.container['Id'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Sample output**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/83978425-f4972e80-a939-11ea-9bc6-95b1e368d1e2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:

the issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9164\r\n\r\n**File changed**: `airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py`\r\n\r\n**Problems**\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**: When `xcom_push=True` is enabled (and `xcom_push_all=False`), the output **sometimes is null** OR captured in wrongly.\r\n* **Issue 2**: When `xcom_push_all=True` a bytes string (`b'...'`) is stored as xcom, It's harder to use the output on following operators and do not conform with other operators.\r\n* **Issue 3**: `Stderr` and `stdout` are written to the same output xcom. In practice, we don't want warnings and errors messing up with the code to be parsed on following operators (But we need to capture the output on airflow logs). Sending `stderr` to xcom can lead to undefined/non-deterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**: The issue here is that the [attach](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py#L241) starts before the [wait](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py#L255). But seems there's an issue if we try to run `wait` before `attach` using `stream=True` that freezes and don't return any output (I did not dig deep, but probably will become an issue on `docker python SDK` later). A simple solution is to run `logs` as It's a [wrapper for attach](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docker/api/container.py#L22). I followed this way and refactored part of the code, instead of two calls I saved the output on a list after `wait`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            self.cli.start(self.container[\"Id\"])\r\n\r\n            result = self.cli.wait(self.container[\"Id\"])\r\n\r\n            lines = [\r\n                templ.decode(\"utf-8\").strip() if hasattr(templ, \"decode\") else str(templ)\r\n                for templ in self.cli.logs(\r\n                    self.container[\"Id\"], stream=True, stdout=True, stderr=False\r\n                )\r\n            ]\r\n```\r\nWhy a list, not a generator?\r\nBecause I might use two times, a generator can be used only once per request:\r\n```python\r\n            for line in lines:\r\n                self.log.info(line)\r\n   \r\n            ...\r\n\r\n            if self.do_xcom_push:\r\n                return \"\\n\".join(lines) if self.xcom_all else line\r\n            else:\r\n                return None\r\n```\r\nSo I decided to just keep as a list to make the code less complex. And do not repeat the request as the original code.\r\n* **Issue 2**:  I just added:\r\n```python\r\n...\r\ntempl.decode(\"utf-8\").strip() if hasattr(templ, \"decode\") else str(templ)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis will ensure that every line will be decoded if possible, if not, then return the string representation of It (DockerOperator always return bytes string, but if in the future other objects are possible, this keep It consistent against errors).\r\n**I expect that this part can cause some discussion**, because I'm changing the output from `bytes` to `string` (my personal opinion is that being `bytes` is an issue and should be changed to `string` as BashOperator). There's no documentation about what should be the value stored as xcom from DockerOperator, but If this is a big issue I suggest creating a flag (`xcom_string=False`), but personally I don't like this approach.\r\n* **Issue 3**:  I created a separated list that only stores `stderr`:\r\n```python\r\n            warnings = [\r\n                tempw.decode(\"utf-8\").strip() if hasattr(tempw, \"decode\") else str(tempw)\r\n                for tempw in self.cli.logs(\r\n                    self.container[\"Id\"], stream=True, stdout=False, stderr=True\r\n                )\r\n            ]\r\n\r\n            for warning in warnings:\r\n                self.log.warning(warning)\r\n```\r\nIn the end, only logs are send to xcom and if any error is raised, the DAG run fail:\r\n```python\r\n            if result[\"StatusCode\"] != 0:\r\n                raise AirflowException(\"docker container failed: \" + repr(result))\r\n\r\n            if self.do_xcom_push:\r\n                return \"\\n\".join(lines) if self.xcom_all else line\r\n            else:\r\n                return None\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Sample Output**\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**:\r\n  * Captured correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/83961479-1060ed00-a8c6-11ea-9fb8-860c8b60107b.png)\r\n`We would expect only the last line '9'`\r\n* **Issue 2**:\r\n  *

a long time the way how entrypoint worked in ci scripts\r\nwas wrong. The way it worked was convoluted and short of black\r\nmagic. This did not allow to pass multiple test targets and\r\nrequired separate execute command scripts in Breeze.\r\n\r\nThis is all now straightened out and both production and\r\nCI image are always using the right entrypoint by default\r\nand we can simply pass parameters to the image as usual without\r\nescaping strings.\r\n\r\nThis also allowed to remove some breeze commands and\r\nchange names of several flags in Breeze to make them more\r\nmeaningful.\r\n\r\nBoth CI and PROD image have now embedded scripts for log\r\ncleaning.\r\n\r\nHistory of image releases is added for

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept the following PR that\r\n\r\nAdd the KafkaProducerHook.\r\nAdd the KafkaConsumerHook.\r\nAdd the KafkaSensor which listens to messages with a specific topic.\r\nRelated Issue:\r\n#1311\r\n\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6786)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x]  Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with [AIRFLOW-NNNN]. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\n- [X] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [X] Commits follow \"How to write a good git commit message\"\r\n- [X] Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n- [X] I will engage committers as explained in Contribution Workflow Example.\r\n* For document-only changes commit message can start with [AIRFLOW-XXXX].\r\n\r\nReminder to contributors:\r\n\r\nYou must add an Apache License header to all new files\r\nPlease squash your commits when possible and follow the 7 rules of good Git commits\r\nI am new to the community, I am not sure the files are at the right place or missing anything.\r\n\r\nThe sensor could be used as the first node of a dag where the second node can be a TriggerDagRunOperator. The messages are polled in a batch and the dag runs are dynamically generated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNote, as per denied PR #1415, it is important to mention these integrations are not suitable for low-latency/high-throughput/streaming.

small PR solves the issue described at https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9139\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nThere's a small logic error on [sql_to_gcs.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/sql_to_gcs.py#L295). When `gzip` option is set to `True` the line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nself.gzip if tmp_file.get('file_name') == self.schema_filename else False\r\n```\r\nReturns `hook.upload(..., gzip=True)` **if the file is the schema file** and keep the data file intact. What we want instead is a compressed data file and keep the schema file intact. \r\n\r\nWe implemented this fix in our production environment to overwrite this function, but would be nice to get It released back to the community. We've been using It for weeks now and no issues from this small change were reported.\r\n\r\nNo changes in documentation/tests/signature of functions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes

uses `MY_DIR` to mean scripts/ci, but in `breeze` `MY_DIR`\r\nis the same as AIRFLOW_SOURCES. When jumping back-and-forth between\r\nci/_utils.sh, breeze, and ci/ci_\\*.sh it can be confusing to keep track\r\nof what is what.\r\n\r\nThis changes `breeze` to use `AIRFLOW_SOURCES` to referrer to the top\r\nlevel folder instead -- that means I don't have to keep as much context\r\nin my head. I realise the MY_DIR was just \"the folder of the script\", but for some reason this was confusing my in breeze where AIRFLOW_SOURCES already existed.\r\n\r\nIn doing this I noticed a small \"bug\" --

Airflow can't execute some schedules, e.g., every 10 min between 16:30 and 18:10. This type of schedule becomes possible if defined as multiple cron expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still a work in progress, meant for discussing the viability of such feature.\r\n\r\nSome points to consider:\r\n\r\n- The first commit shows what is possible with minimal code changes. The second commit goes further and replaces all uses of `croniter` with the new `Cron` class. Which one is preferable?\r\n\r\n- The second commit changes `normalized_schedule_interval` in DAG, moving the translation of cron presets (e.g `@daily`) into the `Cron` class? Is it a good idea? Maybe not, as at least one serialization test broke and had to be fixed, I imagine other things may also break.\r\n\r\n- How should this type of schedule interval be displayed on the web UI? For up to three or four elements it looks fine, but for example a schedule interval with 10 cron expressions in the list is difficult to show, starting with the `Schedule` column in the Home page.\r\n\r\n- At the moment the class lives in `utils/dates.py`, should it be somewhere else? Maybe create a `models/scheduleinterval.py`?\r\n\r\n- Missing documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of

method returns incorrect values. We have a different way of determining this path that uses the template. But more important to me is that you can't write a method that works in every case, because we're starting to support more advanced tools that don't use files, so it is impossible to determine the correct file path in every case e.g. Stackdriver doesn't use file but identifies logs based on labels.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description

\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI am using airflow SparkSubmitOperator to schedule my spark jobs on kubernetes cluster. \r\n\r\nBut for some reason, kubernetes often throw 'too old resource version' exception which will interrupt spark watcher, then airflow will lost the log stream and could not get 'Exit Code' eventually. So airflow will mark job failed once log stream lost but the job is still running.\r\n\r\nThis is  a solution about a simple retry mechanism which is when the log stream is interrupted, then call  method  'read_namespaced_pod()', which is provided by kubernetes client api,  to get spark driver pod status.\r\n\r\n## Target Github
