[eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) from 8.8.0 to 9.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">eslint-config-prettier's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Version 9.0.0 (2023-08-05)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: The CLI helper tool now works with eslint.config.js (flat config). Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the [ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the <em>config</em> of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) – it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.</li>\n<li>Changed: [unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add <code>&quot;unicode-bom&quot;: &quot;off&quot;</code> to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with <code>--fix</code> to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM). Thanks to Nicolas Stepien (<a href=\"https://github.com/nstepien\"><code>@​nstepien</code></a>)!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 8.10.0 (2023-08-03)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: [max-statements-per-line]. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Zamiell\"><code>@​Zamiell</code></a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 8.9.0 (2023-07-27)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: [vue/array-element-newline].

href=\"https://github.com/google/compile-testing/releases\">com.google.testing.compile:compile-testing's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.21.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug: When comparing ASTs, for example in <code>JavaFileObjectSubject.hasSourceEquivalentTo</code>, some kinds of nodes were omitted from the comparison. In particular, if the expected code had an annotated type or a union type (multicatch), the actual code could contain anything at that point and the test would still pass. This was also true for post-Java-8 constructs like module declarations, <code>yield</code> statements, and the like. These omissions have been corrected. <strong>Some tests may now fail</strong> if the expected and actual source do not match, in ways that were hidden by this bug. (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/compile-testing/commit/9a592f77821adecf10a16a7a4cdd2f071ddcf136\">https://github.com/google/compile-testing/commit/9a592f77821adecf10a16a7a4cdd2f071ddcf136</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.20</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow sources being compiled to be read from annotation processors. (95e749d)</li>\n<li>Fix false negative when comparing source files that differ only in try-with-resources specifications. (cb6486c)</li>\n<li>Add <code>withAnnotationProcessorPath()</code> to <code>Compiler</code>. (80a9ee0)</li>\n<li>Improve error messages rendered by <code>JavaSourcesSubject.parsesAs()</code> and <code>JavaFileObjectSubject.containsElementsIn()</code> to more easily distinguish between errors incurred in <em>actual</em> vs <em>expected</em> source. (115014e)</li>\n<li>Use <code>@Nullable</code> from the Checker Framework and fix a few null-correctness issues. (6260258)</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where testing <code>package-info.java</code> with <code>parsesAs()</code> threw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. (c46b1b6)</li>\n<li>Close <code>JavaCompiler</code> objects to avoid resource leaks.

TINKERPOP-2946 by introducing TinkerShuffleGraph and running feature tests against an embedded instance of this graph.\r\n\r\nTinkerShuffleGraph is derived from TinkerGraph and intended for test purposes only. It's only differentiation from TinkerGraph is that it will returned shuffled results when getting any of the following:\r\n\r\nvertices from the graph,\r\nedges from the graph,\r\nvertices from a vertex,\r\nedges from a vertex,\r\nvertices from an edge,\r\nproperties from a vertex,\r\nproperties from an edge, and\r\nproperties from a VertexProperty\r\n\r\nA new feature test annotation `@InsertionOrderingRequired` has been added to flag tests which are reliant on a graph which predictably returns elements in the order of insertion (such as TinkerGraph). Such tests should be avoided whenever possible. 2 ValueMap tests require the flag due to TINKERPOP-2974, a few of the new tests for combine() and conjoin() are also order dependent which we should seek to resolve soon. There is also one test for shortestPath which I am unsure why it is dependent on ordering.","created_at":"2023-07-24T22:49:23Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T23:47:38Z","closed_at":"2023-11-01T23:47:38Z","merged_at":"2023-11-01T23:47:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"07668257c08ac9cedf5ab71fd6fcaa5ecba5c266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/f418a76d383460f810596365f3ef54514a553671","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/TinkerShuffleGraph","ref":"cole/TinkerShuffleGraph","sha":"f418a76d383460f810596365f3ef54514a553671","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

PR is meant to supersede https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2061.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a version bump for jackson, a bump for the shade plugin (required due to jackson 2.15.0 being a multi-release jar containing some java 17 and java 20 classes), as well as additional configuration options for graphSON serializers.\r\n\r\nJackson 2.15.0 adds new StreamReadConstraints which set a max length for numbers, strings, and a max nesting depth. These have been configured to 10 000, 20 000 000, and 1000 by default in TinkerPop. New serializer configs for `maxNumberLength`, `maxStringLength`, and `maxNestingDepth` have been added to graphSON serializers to adjust these values if needed.\r\n\r\nVOTE
