need a way to be able to specify environment variables at runtime. Specifically, we want to set the heap space available to our pig cli. We would ordinarily do this by prepending these variables before the pig executable, for example:\n\n``` bash\nPIG_OPTS=\"$PIG_OPTS -Xmx512M\" pig -useHCatalog script.pig\n```\n\nThe `subprocess.Popen` method allows you to pass environment variables in, so I figured that would be the best interface. You can just define a dict in your connection option that maps environment variable names to values. At runtime, the hook will add these to the existing environment variables from `os.environ` and make them available when the pig command is executed.\n","created_at":"2016-03-21T23:31:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T05:45:02Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T05:45:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f3551120cf166f80d85964d6381d6cc7b2efb91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/886aa3512633a412394446aea7711739fb98f926","head":{"label":"adambom:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"886aa3512633a412394446aea7711739fb98f926","user":{"login":"adambom","id":294597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom","html_url":"https://github.com/adambom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53985985,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mzk4NTk4NQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"adambom/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adambom","id":294597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom","html_url":"https://github.com/adambom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adambom/airflow","description":"Airflow

to this change, uploads would fail if the target file was larger than the specified multipart_bytes value. This is problematic when you're handling files that can vary in size. It makes sense to handle this inside the hook rather than forcing the user to manage this. Now S3Hook.load_file will automatically detect whether or not the file is large enough to qualify for multibyte uploads and use the appropriate method. Also added a default of 5GB for multipart_bytes. This value makes sense because S3 will automatically fail when uploading files larger than this unless multipart uploads are used.\n\nFixes #1153\n@artwr

refactor of the `airflow.utils` from a file into a folder with topics. As we scale out the Airflow code base, this will help us follow good practices of keeping small modules, and will make finding code easier. \n\nThe goal of this PR is to establish foundations to that effect, following the examples set by projects like Django and IPython.\n\nThis is more of a starting point, and I welcome comments on how to make this better. I apologize for the sheer size fo the PR, the surgery was extensive. \n\nNote that this will include some backwards incompatible changes in `utils`. Since `utils` is mostly used by people extending Airflow, I believe this is still ok, and will help the community grow by making the code base better organized and easier to contribute to.\n\n@mistercrunch\n","created_at":"2016-03-01T01:19:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:07Z","closed_at":"2016-03-26T00:26:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c79773d7c297615f39aebca0a6ad12ce05cbb03e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fb86cb2def73f55da5dff69feb959a32a3c724a3","head":{"label":"apache:utils_refactor","ref":"utils_refactor","sha":"fb86cb2def73f55da5dff69feb959a32a3c724a3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache
