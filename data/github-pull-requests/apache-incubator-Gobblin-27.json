race condition is when a directory D1/a/b/c/d is renamed to D2/a/b/c/d after another thread created D2/a/b/c/d.\r\nThis resulted in D2/a/b/c/d/d. Handle this by using the Java renameTo() method to avoid the LocalFileSystem fallback of copy.\r\nThe copy fallback also results in a race condition when a file is opened for copy in one thread and the parent directory is createed in another thread. A file not found exception is encountered in this case. This case is handled by catching the exception and retrying a few times.","created_at":"2016-11-19T02:24:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T19:26:31Z","closed_at":"2016-11-21T17:44:24Z","merged_at":"2016-11-21T17:44:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"da522eb5d171503ed781361307f75f458ff8be3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/18e1c2d232671bd6f16f40d8a46da55f73ba2bac","head":{"label":"htran1:rename_fix","ref":"rename_fix","sha":"18e1c2d232671bd6f16f40d8a46da55f73ba2bac","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73107999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzEwNzk5OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"htran1/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/htran1/gobblin","description":"Universal

New construct of VersionCleaner in Retention with pre and post activity hook. \r\n\r\nB. Capability in Hive retention to swap-in a partition from another table in lieu of the partition being deleted from the current table as post cleanup activity. \r\n\r\nThis is important for use-cases such as hybrid tables (with Avro and ORC based partitions), where we want to replace ORC partitions with Avro partitions when certain retention predicate become true (such as retain ORC partitions for 30 days, and then replace them with Avro partitions from another table which has the same data in Avro format) \r\n\r\nTo illustrate its functioning lets assume that: \r\n1. We want to delete ORC partition (date=\"2016-01-01-00\") from table db_orc.prod1_table_orc\r\n2. We want to register Avro partition (date=\"2016-01-01-00\") from table db_avro.prod2_table_avro to table db_orc.prod1_table_orc at the same time (since it contains same data but in different physical format ie. avro)\r\n\r\nSo, this is achieved as follows:\r\n1. Following configuration is set in config store for this dataset (or parent level dataset, refer to config store setup details to learn more in Gobblin wiki): \r\n- hive.datasetNamePattern = $LOGICAL_DB_orc.prod1_$LOGICAL_TABLE_orc\r\n- hive.replacementHiveDbName = $LOGICAL_DB_avro\r\n- hive.replacementHiveTableName = prod2_$LOGICAL_TABLE_avro\r\n- hive.shouldReplacePartition = true (to enable partition replacement) \r\nNote: $LOGICAL_DB and $LOGICAL_TABLE are recognized tokens by the code \r\nIn HiveDataset, by applying hive.datasetNamePattern on current Hive dataset (db.table): \r\n$LOGICAL_DB is auto-resolved to: db \r\n$LOGICAL_TABLE is auto-resolved to: table \r\nhive.replacementHiveDbName is auto-resolved to: db_avro \r\nhive.replacementHiveTableName is auto-resolved to: prod2_table_avro \r\n2. The HiveVersionCleaner in its clean() method, drops the partition (date=\"2016-01-01-00\") from db_orc.prod1_table_orc\r\n3. The HiveVersionCleaner in its postCleanAction() method then registers the corresponding partition (date=\"2016-01-01-00\") from db_avro.prod2_table_avro to db_orc.prod1_table_orc table \r\n\r\nPlease note: This cross-registration of the partition does not duplicates the data, rather the partition registration is only a reference to the data from source table

have repeated issues with converting Properties to Config because of keys which are prefixes of other keys.\r\n\r\nThe approach I've taken is to detect Properties collections which have such keys and sanitize the names for such properties.\r\n\r\n- ConfigUtils.propertiesToConfig() will detect such keys and append .ROOT_VALUE at the end of the offending property\r\n- ConfigUtils.configToProperties() will detect properties which end in .ROOT_VALUE and remove it transparently.\r\n\r\nFor legacy jobs, constructs we typically have the flow: Job pull file (Properties) -> Job config (Config) -> State properties. PullFileLoader/SchedulerUtils use the ConfigUtils.propertiesToConfig() to do the first transition and JobLauncherExecutionDriver uses ConfigUtils.configToProperties() to do the second transition, the offending properties are handled transparently.\r\n\r\nFurther, when we move to fully Config-based job files, we can still explicitly add the .ROOT_VALUE suffix and work with legacy components.\r\n\r\nI've refactored a bunch of classes to use ConfigUtils.propertiesToConfig() instead of ConfigFactory.parseProperties() to make use of the santiization.\r\n\r\n@ydai @pcadabam  Can

PR contains two enhancements: \r\n- Hive registration config governing database and tables to register has been made more generic.\r\n- Basic template support added for Hive tables to register. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, if we have the following config: \r\n```\r\n# Databases to register to\r\nhive.database.name=db1 \r\nadditional.hive.database.name=db2 \r\n\r\n# Tables to register in each database \r\nhive.table.name=tbl1 \r\nadditional.hive.table.name=tbl2,tbl3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the following Hive db.table registration will take place: \r\n```\r\ndb1.tbl1 \r\ndb1.tbl2\r\ndb1.tbl3\r\ndb2.tbl1 \r\ndb2.tbl2\r\ndb2.tbl3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, there was no way to control selectively tables that should only be registered to a database, with this PR the following config is possible: \r\n```\r\n# Databases to register to\r\nhive.database.name=db1 \r\nadditional.hive.database.name=db2 \r\n\r\n# Tables to register in each database \r\nhive.table.name=tbl1 \r\nadditional.hive.table.name=tbl2,tbl3\r\ndb2.additional.hive.table.name=tbl3,tbl4,$PRIMARY_TABLE_col\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this will result in the following Hive db.table registration: \r\n```\r\ndb1.tbl1 \r\ndb1.tbl2\r\ndb1.tbl3\r\ndb2.tbl3

changes:\n- Embedded Gobblin will automatically add the correct classpath to distribute cache for a basic Gobblin run, and allow users to add their own jars.\n- Correctly set sys config in embedded mode.\n- Mr mode will only upload jars to distributed cache when setting up the job.

PR implements a Gobblin CLI for easily running arbitrary run-once applications (and to have a framework to add more applications in the future).\n\nUsage:\n`bin/gobblin run distcp -from /data/source -to /data/target`\n\nSuggested order:\n1. `CliEmbeddedGobblin` instantiates an embedded Gobblin and runs it. Does a lot of dynamic option generation based on the `EmbeddedGobblin` class that the user wants to run. Most of the business logic is here.\n2. `EmbeddedGobblinCliOption`, `EmbeddedGobblinCliSupport`, `NotOnCli`: annotations used to control how `CliEmbeddedGobblin` generates dynamic options for Gobblin applications.\n3. `GobblinCli` instantiates `CliApplication` and runs it.\n4. `bin/gobblin.sh` and `bin/gobblin` used to launch Gobblin.\n5. `EmbeddedGobblin` and `EmbeddedGobblinDistcp`, updated to support calling from CLI.\n","created_at":"2016-10-24T16:53:46Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T15:40:24Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T15:40:22Z","merged_at":"2016-10-26T15:40:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6d4da3f623baacc2d9611a678ddc23f8daf24e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/218f8da78d7eed57b5597e9809a9707982fb8373","head":{"label":"ibuenros:cli","ref":"cli","sha":"218f8da78d7eed57b5597e9809a9707982fb8373","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/rep

are three main changes here:\n- Make JobLauncherExecutionDriver a `FutureTask` (which also makes it a `RunnableFuture`) and a `ListenableFuture`, and it not longer implements `Service`. Futures have a concrete end, which is appropriate for the job driver. `FutureTask` additionally offers a concrete start, which was the other requirement for the job driver. Finally, `ListenableFuture` allows adding callbacks.\n- Make `JobCatalog` a `Service` so it can be shut down allowing it to clean up whatever threads it spawned. Also extended `JobCatalogBase` to handle the service part of the catalog, and implemented `MutableJobCatalogBase` that does the same for `MutableJobCatalog`. Most `JobCatalog` implementations were simplified taking advantage of the base job catalogs.\n- Make `CallbackDispatcher` closeable to allow it to shut down its `ExecutorService`.
