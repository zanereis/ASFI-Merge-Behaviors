change introduces a scheduled batch supervisor in Druid. The supervisor periodically wakes up to submit an MSQ ingest query, allowing users to automate batch ingestion directly within Druid. Think of it as simple batch task workflows natively integrated into Druid, though it doesn't replace more sophisticated workflow management systems like Apache Airflow. This is an experimental feature.\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes:\r\n\r\nThe `scheduled_batch` supervisor can be configured as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"scheduled_batch\",\r\n    \"schedulerConfig\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"unix\",\r\n        \"schedule\": \"*/5 * * * *\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"spec\": {\r\n        \"query\": \"REPLACE INTO foo OVERWRITE ALL SELECT * FROM bar PARTITIONED BY DAY\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"suspended\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe supervisor will submit the `REPLACE` sql query repeatedly every 5 minutes. The supervisor supports two types of cron scheduler configurations:\r\n\r\n 1. Unix cron syntax:\r\n     - Type must be set to `unix`.\r\n     - Follows the [standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) Unix cron format, e.g., `*/5 * * * *` to schedule the SQL task every 5 minutes.\r\n     - Supports macro expressions such as `@daily`, `@hourly`, `@monthly`, etc.\r\n 2. Quartz cron syntax:\r\n     - Type must be set to `quartz`.\r\n     - Offers more flexibility and [control](https://productresources.collibra.com/docs/collibra/latest/Content/Cron/co_quartz-cron-syntax.htm) for scheduling tasks.\r\n     - Example: `0 0 0 ? 3,6,9,12 MON-FRI` to schedule tasks at midnight on weekdays during March, June, September, and December.\r\n\r\nKey points:\r\n- User can specify the `query` along with any context in the `spec`. This structure is identical to what the MSQ task engine [accepts](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/reference#context-parameters).\r\n- Currently, the batch supervisor will repeatedly submit the DML SQL present in the `spec` as-is on its schedule.\r\n- This can be useful for recurring batch ingestion or reindexing tasks.\r\n- There is no parameterization or \"change detection\" support for input sources yet, but some simple mechanisms are planned for the future.\r\n- Users can configure multiple scheduled batch supervisors for the same datasource.\r\n- Only DML ingestion queries are currently supported by the scheduled batch supervisor.\r\n- Users can suspend, resume and terminate the scheduled batch supervisor. Suspending the supervisor stops new tasks from being scheduled. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome implementation details:\r\n- The `indexing-service` module now depends on the `druid-sql` module. This allows the scheduled batch supervisor, running on the Overlord, to communicate with the Broker to:\r\n    a. Validate and parse the user-specified query.\r\n    b. Submit MSQ queries to the `/druid/v2/sql/task/` endpoint.\r\n- A `ScheduledBatchScheduler` is injected in the Overlord, which is responsible for scheduling and unscheduling all scheduled batch instances.\r\n- A `BrokerClient` implementation has been added, leveraging the `ServiceClient` functionality. \r\n- The `SqlTaskStatus` and its unit test `SqlTaskStatusTest` have been moved from the msq module to the sql module so it can be reused by the BrokerClient implementation in the sql module.\r\n- Added `ExplainPlanInformation` class, which is used to deserialize the explain plan response from the Broker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe status API response for the supervisor contains the scheduler state along with active and completed tasks:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8888/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/scheduled_batch__foo__3a916bcf-060d-4a42-aab6-904ff61d25cd/status\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"supervisorId\": \"scheduled_batch__foo__3a916bcf-060d-4a42-aab6-904ff61d25cd\",\r\n  \"status\": \"SCHEDULER_RUNNING\",\r\n  \"lastTaskSubmittedTime\": \"2024-10-18T17:35:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"nextTaskSubmissionTime\": \"2024-10-18T17:40:00.000Z\",\r\n  \"timeUntilNextTaskSubmission\": \"PT122.431S\",\r\n  \"activeTasks\": {\r\n    \"query-6a6f14e1-809a-4832-8b71-7128a23165e9\": {\r\n      \"id\": \"query-6a6f14e1-809a-4832-8b71-7128a23165e9\",\r\n      \"status\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n      \"duration\": -1,\r\n      \"errorMsg\": null,\r\n      \"location\": {\r\n        \"host\": null,\r\n        \"port\": -1,\r\n        \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"completedTasks\": {\r\n    \"query-c38c8c09-c101-45a1-a6d8-3dc64ce16ad3\": {\r\n      \"id\": \"query-c38c8c09-c101-45a1-a6d8-3dc64ce16ad3\",\r\n      \"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n      \"duration\": 503,\r\n      \"errorMsg\": null,\r\n      \"location\": {\r\n        \"host\": null,\r\n        \"port\": -1,\r\n        \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"query-6badb07f-6ed4-49ce-bb70-8a13be53876b\": {\r\n      \"id\": \"query-6badb07f-6ed4-49ce-bb70-8a13be53876b\",\r\n      \"status\": \"SUCCESS\",\r\n      \"duration\": 518,\r\n      \"errorMsg\": null,\r\n      \"location\": {\r\n        \"host\": null,\r\n        \"port\": -1,\r\n        \"tlsPort\": -1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**Future Improvements:**\r\n- **Scheduler State Persistence**: This feature doesn't yet persist the scheduler state. Adding persistence will improve robustness (e.g., preventing missed jobs during Overlord restarts).\r\n- **Task Limits**: There is currently no limit on the maximum number of tasks allowed by the scheduled batch supervisor.  We may want to consider this in the future.\r\n- The Supervisors page in the Druid web-console should change a bit to accommodate this change (more broadly non-streaming supervisors).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a bug with mmless ingestion when overlord leadership is rolled over.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen a overlord newly attains leadership in a cluster running mmless ingestion, it will load all the running tasks from kubernetes, but not the value of taskLocation. taskLocation is populated the first time getTaskLocation() is called on each task.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is getTaskLocation is called in the serviceLocator.locate() method, which runs under the ServiceClientFactory thread pool and is not supposed to make a lot of network calls. Frequently the first caller (before taskLocation is cached) is a supervisor trying to contact its tasks. If there are many supervisors and kafka tasks running in the cluster, the ServiceClientFactory threads can get stuck trying to call locate() (since the function will block on reaching out to k8s for the pod ips).\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nSince we don't actually need to update taskLocation (the pod IP is static through the lifetime of a k8s pod and we don't retry jobs), we can just load taskLocation right after the pod has started (in the join method).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- fix bug with mmless ingestion in high scale clusters\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

currently supports only single-valued string dimensions as partition keys. This patch adds a check to ensure that partition keys are single-valued in case this info is available by virtue of segment download for schema inference. \r\n\r\nDuring compaction, if MSQ finds multi-valued dimensions (MVDs) declared as part of `range` partitionsSpec, it switches partitioning type to `dynamic`, ending up in repeated compactions of the same interval.  To avoid this scenario, the segment download logic is also updated to always download segments if info on multi-valued dimensions is required.

#17284 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds a new function JSON_MERGE_AGGR(<AGGREGATE>,<JSON 1>, <JSON 2> .... <JSON N>) which performs the aggregation when the leaf elements have the same key.\r\n\r\nCurrently only two aggregators are added - ADD & MULTIPLY\r\nFor Array, it retains the functionality of JSON_MERGE function.\r\n \r\n##### Example \r\n`JSON_MERGE_AGGR('ADD', {\"key\": 2}, {\"key\":3}) -> {\"key\":5}`\r\n`JSON_MERGE_AGGR('MULTIPLY', {\"key\": {\"k2\": 2}}, {\"key\":{\"k2\":3}}) -> {\"key\":{\"k2\":6}}`\r\n \r\n##### Retained JSON_MERGE functionality \r\n`JSON_MERGE_AGGR('ADD', {\"key\": [1,2,3]}, {\"key\":[4,5]}) -> {\"key\":[1,2,3,4,5]}`\r\n`JSON_MERGE_AGGR('ADD', {\"key\": [1,2]}, {\"key\":3}) -> {\"key\":3}`\r\n`JSON_MERGE_AGGR('ADD', [1,2,3], [4,5]) -> [1,2,3,4,5]`\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `json_merge_aggr` expression function\r\n * `json_merge_aggr` sql function\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by

Description\r\nPolling the druid_segments and druid_pendingSegments tables can be a bottleneck for several operations in Druid and the load on the metadata store increases with the number of segments in the cluster.\r\nThis PR aims to maintain a central cache of active segments and relevant pending segments on the Overlord and use this wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n- Faster segment allocation (`40x` in SegmentAllocateActionTest#testBenchmark) -> Lower lag especially in situations where data is being backfilled\r\n- (TODO?) Faster segment syncing on coordinator -> Faster ingestion handoff on clusters where polling millions of segments (with hundreds of columns) takes a few minutes\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Cache segment timelines for used segments and pending segments for intervals with active locks on the overlord.\r\n- Use this info for segment allocation\r\n- Every segment allocation or segment commit transactionally updates the cache\r\n- (TODO) Ensure that marking segments as unused or cleaning up pending segments on the Overlord also clear the cache.\r\n- (TODO) Make all the calls from the Coordinator go through the Overlord before altering druid_segments or druid_pendingSegments in order to have a centralized cache\r\n- (TODO?) Use this cache and poll segments incrementally on the Coodinator\r\n\r\n\r\n### Potential issues:\r\n- There can be an increase in memory but an overhead of a similar magnitude was already introduced with the CompactionSupervisor on the Overlord. This cache can be utilized by the compaction supervisor as well.\r\n- Time taken for leader election can be high. (May be mitigated by falling back to the DB when the cache is initializing)\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nCache initialization:\r\n- When a TaskLockbox syncs for the first time upon leader election, obtain all the pending segments for active locks and cache only these. Any other pending segment must be irrelevant for segment allocation.\r\n- Also obtain all the used datasources and add all their segments to the cache.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-13T13:14:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T10:40:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1433958072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDMzOTU4MDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Dependencies","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen supervisors are configured with incorrect lag based scaling config, where minTaskCount is greater than the partitions on the stream, it always tries to issue scaling actions which are redundant but causes tasks to get published more frequently than needed.\r\n\r\nWe are handling this situation when maxTaskCount is greater than partitions, this PR uses the same check for minTaskCount too.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `LagBasedAutoScaler`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done

However, it erroneously fires only if the response *was* handled. This causes HTTP 500 errors if the timeout actually does fire. The timeout is 30 seconds, which can be hit during pipelined queries, if an earlier stage of the query hasn't produced its first frame within 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression introduced in #17140.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen calling and using IndexTask directly, if java.io.tmpDir is not specified separately, directories such as '/tmp/1728623820267-0' will continue to be created.\r\nIn order to create a desired path without specifying java.io.tmpDir, inject the 'basePersistDirectory' value into 'RealtimeTuningConfig' through the 'basePersistDirectory' setting for 'IndexTuningConfig' in 'IndexIngestionSpec'.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf you specify 'basePersistDirectory' in 'IndexTask.IndexTuningConfig', you can specify 'basePersistDirectory' in 'RealtimeTuningConfig'.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis change switches the order of query vs stats in `getNativeQueryLine` to keep it consistent with `getSqlQueryLine`.\r\n\r\nIt happens on non-trivial occasions when a long list of `intervals.segments` in the query object exceeds the max cut-off of whichever logging system is deployed by the user and makes the stats unavailable for subsequent log searches. In those situations, we prefer to have the more important stats logged first and sacrifice the list of intervals.\r\n\r\nThe same change should be applied to the order of fields in the native query object, moving `intervals` to the last. However, that's a bigger change.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `RequestLogLine`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixed a non deterministic test in `org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest.testSerdeWithInputFormat`\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nTo reproduce the problem, first build the module `kafka-indexing-service`:\r\n\r\n> mvn install -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service -am -DskipTests\r\n\r\nThen, run the regular test:\r\n\r\n> mvn -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest#testSerdeWithInputFormat\r\n\r\nTo identify the flaky test, execute the following [nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) command:\r\n\r\n> mvn -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest#testSerdeWithInputFormat\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe testSerdeWithInputFormat was producing non-deterministic output because the JSON object used in the test did not include a parser that enforced a specific order, unlike other tests. Due to the inherent non-deterministic nature of JSON serialization, this resulted in inconsistent outputs. The dimension spec array gave non deterministic order on different runs as follow- \r\nexpected: `\"dimensionExclusions\":[\"__time\",\"value_max\",\"count\",\"value_min\",\"value_sum\",\"value]\",\"timestamp\"]` \r\nactual: `\"dimensionExclusions\":[\"value_sum\",\"value\",\"count\",\"__time\",\"value_min\",\"value_max]\",\"timestamp\"] `.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves adding a parser to the JSON like the other tests to ensure a consistent order.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist below are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16849 added support for sorting segments with non-time columns. This PR extends that support to MSQ compaction. Specifically, if `forceSegmentSortByTime` is set in the data schema -- either in the user-supplied compaction config or in the inferred schema -- the following steps are taken:\r\n\r\n- Skip adding `__time` explicitly as the first column to the dimension schema since it already comes as part of the schema\r\n- Ensure column mappings propagate `__time` in the order specified by the schema \r\n- Set `forceSegmentSortByTime` in the MSQ context.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PR adds (missing) unit tests for verifying MSQ spec generated with nested and auto-type columns \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe `OverlordCompactionScheduler` may sometimes launch a duplicate compaction task for an interval that has just been compacted.\r\n\r\nThis may happen as follows:\r\n- Scheduler launches a compaction task for an uncompacted interval.\r\n- While the compaction task is running, the `CompactionStatusTracker` does not consider this interval as compactible and returns the `CompactionStatus` as `SKIPPED` for it.\r\n- As soon as the compaction task finishes, the `CompactionStatusTracker` starts considering the interval eligible for compaction again.\r\n- This interval remains eligible for compaction until the newly published segments are polled from the database.\r\n- Once the new segments have been polled, the `CompactionStatus` of the interval changes to `COMPLETE`.\r\n\r\n### Change\r\n- Keep track of the `snapshotTime` in `DataSourcesSnapshot`. This time represents the start of the poll.\r\n- Use the `snapshotTime` to determine if a poll has happened after a compaction task completed.\r\n- If not, then skip the interval to avoid launching duplicate tasks.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n#### Before fix: Duplicate compaction tasks for the same interval\r\n<img width=\"1721\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-08 at 8 04 00 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07d3fc79-a0a7-4697-973e-72262ddd0dc1\">\r\n\r\n#### After fix: No duplicate compaction tasks\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"duplicate_after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e37d73-65a8-43c4-ba06-1b8b97a8e1db\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

HTTP 202 (Accepted) on cancellation, even if the requested query ID was not found.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this is that when the Router broadcasts DELETE requests to all Brokers, it returns the response from one of them randomly. If we return 404 when a query ID isn't found, then the Router randomly returns 404s even when the query really was found and canceled.\r\n\r\nThis is also arguably still correct behavior. The cancellation request *was* accepted, it just won't do anything because the query was not in fact running.","created_at":"2024-10-08T07:50:59Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T08:46:32Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T10:19:35Z","merged_at":"2024-10-08T10:19:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a279e634a0cdd0fdc29ce3774fedaf7678ed025","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixed a flaky test in `org.apache.druid.query.movingaverage.MovingAverageIterableTest.testMissingDataAtTheEnd`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem, first build the module `moving-average-query`:\r\n```shell\r\nmvn install -pl extensions-contrib/moving-average-query -am -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run the regular test:\r\n```shell\r\nmvn -pl extensions-contrib/moving-average-query test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.movingaverage.MovingAverageIterableTest#testMissingDataAtTheEnd\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTo identify the flaky test, execute the following [nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) command:\r\n ```shell\r\nmvn -pl extensions-contrib/moving-average-query edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.movingaverage.MovingAverageIterableTest#testMissingDataAtTheEnd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe flaky test results from an incorrect assumption about the order of default elements in the `MovingAverageIterable` class. Specifically, when there are missing data points at the end of `MovingAverageIterable`, it inserts default elements that need not follow a specific order within the given timing phase.\r\n\r\nThe original test code makes two asserts on the last two missing elements. It has been fixed by adding `or` between multiple asserts to make sure there is no order assumptions on it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Fixes a bug causing compaction to fail on array, complex, and other non-primitive-type columns\r\n2. Updates compaction status check to be conscious of partition dimensions when comparing dimension ordering.\r\n3. Ensures only string columns are specified as partition dimensions\r\n4. Ensures `rollup` is true if and only if metricsSpec is non-empty\r\n5. Ensures disjoint intervals aren't submitted for compaction\r\n6. Adds `compactionReason` to compaction task context.\r\n\r\n### Key classes to review\r\n\r\n- `MSQCompactionRunner`\r\n- `CompactionStatus`\r\n- `ClientCompactionRunnerInfo`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR \r\n1. Removes microsecond as supported unit for EXTRACT function. Currently the function is returning `epoch(in secs)/1000` which is incorrect.\r\n2.

Updated the docs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuery - SELECT TIME_EXTRACT(CAST('2013-10-07 12:13:27.123457' AS TIMESTAMP), 'MILLISECOND')\r\nResult - 123 // Expected\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was added as part of https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/ea4bad783691da2b8530eb8ad3daf6a0ad2d0a37\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Bug\r\n```\r\nQuery1 - SELECT EXTRACT(MILLISECOND FROM CAST('2013-10-07 12:13:27.123457' AS TIMESTAMP))\r\nResult - 123 // Expected\r\n\r\nQuery2 - SELECT EXTRACT(MICROSECOND FROM CAST('2013-10-07 12:13:27.123456' AS TIMESTAMP))\r\nResult - 1,381,148 // **Incorrect**.
