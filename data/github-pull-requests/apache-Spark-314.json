What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17227, I realised here we type-dispatch per record. The PR itself is fine in terms of performance as is but this prints a prefix, `\"obj\"` in exception message as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\nschema = StructType([StructField('s', IntegerType(), nullable=False)])\r\nspark.createDataFrame([[\"1\"]], schema)\r\n...\r\nTypeError: obj.s: IntegerType can not accept object '1' in type <type 'str'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggested to get rid of this but during investigating this, I realised my approach might bring a performance regression as it is a hot path.\r\n\r\nOnly for SPARK-19507 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17227, It needs more changes to cleanly get rid of the prefix and I rather decided to fix both issues together.\r\n\r\n**Propersal**\r\n\r\nThis PR tried to\r\n\r\n  - get rid of per-record type dispatch as we do in many code paths in Scala  so that it improves the performance (roughly ~25% improvement) - SPARK-21296\r\n\r\n    This was tested with a simple code `spark.createDataFrame(range(1000000), \"int\")`. However, I am quite sure the actual improvement in practice is larger than this, in particular, when the schema is complicated.\r\n\r\n   - improve error message in exception describing field information as prose - SPARK-19507\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unit tests were added in `python/pyspark/sql/tests.py`.\r\n\r\nBenchmark - codes:

PR adds a `FeatureHasher` transformer, modeled on [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html) and [Vowpal wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Feature-Hashing-and-Extraction).\r\n\r\nThe transformer operates on multiple input columns in one pass. Current behavior is:\r\n* for numerical columns, the values are assumed to be real values and the feature index is `hash(columnName)` while feature value is `feature_value`\r\n* for string columns, the values are assumed to be categorical and the feature index is `hash(column_name=feature_value)`, while feature value is `1.0`\r\n* For hash collisions, feature values will be summed\r\n* `null` (missing) values are ignored\r\n\r\nThe following dataframe illustrates the basic semantics:\r\n```\r\n+---+------+-----+---------+------+-----------------------------------------+\r\n|int|double|float|stringNum|string|features

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is strange that we will get \"table not found\" error if **the first sql** uses upper case table names, when developers write tests with `TestHiveSingleton`, **although case insensitivity**. This is because in `TestHiveQueryExecution`, test tables are loaded based on exact matching instead of case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SessionState` is designed to be created lazily. However, in reality, it created immediately in `SparkSession.Builder.getOrCreate` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L943)).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to recover the lazy behavior by keeping the options into `initialSessionOptions`. The benefit is like the following. Users can start `spark-shell` and use RDD operations without any problems.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\n$ bin/spark-shell\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error while instantiating 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder'\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException:\r\n       MetaException(message:java.security.AccessControlException:\r\n          Permission denied: user=spark, access=READ,\r\n             inode=\"/apps/hive/warehouse\":hive:hdfs:drwx------\r\n```\r\nAs reported in SPARK-20256, this happens when the warehouse directory is not allowed for this user.\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\n$ bin/spark-shell\r\n...\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, each application and each worker creates their own proxy servlet. Each proxy servlet is backed by its own HTTP client and a relatively large number of selector threads. This is excessive but was fixed (to an extent) by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18437.\r\n\r\nHowever, a single HTTP client (backed by a single selector thread) should be enough to handle all proxy requests. This PR creates a single proxy servlet no matter how many applications and workers there are.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n.\r\nThe unit tests for rewriting proxied locations and headers were updated. I then spun up a 100 node cluster to ensure that proxy'ing worked correctly\r\n\r\n@jiangxb1987 Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help push this thru.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR supports schema in a DDL formatted string for `from_json` in R/Python and `dapply` and `gapply` in R, which are commonly used and/or consistent with Scala APIs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR exposes `structType` in R to allow working around in other possible corner cases.\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\n`from_json`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import from_json\r\n\r\ndata = [(1, '''{\"a\": 1}''')]\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data, (\"key\", \"value\"))\r\ndf.select(from_json(df.value, \"a INT\").alias(\"json\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R**\r\n\r\n`from_json`\r\n\r\n```R\r\ndf <- sql(\"SELECT named_struct('name', 'Bob') as people\")\r\ndf <- mutate(df, people_json = to_json(df$people))\r\nhead(select(df, from_json(df$people_json, \"name STRING\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n`structType.character`\r\n\r\n```R\r\nstructType(\"a STRING, b INT\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dapply`\r\n\r\n```R\r\ndapply(createDataFrame(list(list(1.0)), \"a\"), function(x) {x}, \"a DOUBLE\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gapply`\r\n\r\n```R\r\ngapply(createDataFrame(list(list(1.0)), \"a\"), \"a\", function(key, x) { x }, \"a DOUBLE\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoc tests for `from_json` in Python and unit tests `test_sparkSQL.R` in R.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-01T09:11:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:42Z","closed_at":"2017-07-10T17:42:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db152bd32c3a93e7b426a11084d2b505fd9ae931","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5dd2b6e28b57b5d6bab44e813b0f467b3af4799c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21266","ref":"SPARK-21266","sha":"5dd2b6e28b57b5d6bab44e813b0f467b3af4799c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor randomForest classifier, if test data contains unseen labels, it will throw an error. The StringIndexer already has the handleInvalid logic. The patch add a new method to set the underlying StringIndexer handleInvalid logic.\r\n\r\nThis patch should also apply to other classifiers. This PR focuses on the main logic and randomForest classifier. I will do follow-up PR for other classifiers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new unit test based on the error case in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe scal() and creation of newCenter vector is done in the driver, after a collectAsMap operation while it could be done in the distributed RDD.\r\nThis PR moves this code before the collectAsMap for more efficiency\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested manually by running the KMeansExample and verifying that the new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixed NPE when creating encoder for enum.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to create an encoder for Enum type (or bean with enum property) via Encoders.bean(...), it fails with NullPointerException at TypeToken:495.\r\nI did a little research and it turns out, that in JavaTypeInference following code\r\n```\r\n  def getJavaBeanReadableProperties(beanClass: Class[_]): Array[PropertyDescriptor] = {\r\n    val beanInfo = Introspector.getBeanInfo(beanClass)\r\n    beanInfo.getPropertyDescriptors.filterNot(_.getName == \"class\")\r\n      .filter(_.getReadMethod != null)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nfilters out properties named \"class\", because we wouldn't want to serialize that. But enum types have another property of type Class named \"declaringClass\", which we are trying to inspect recursively.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor configurations with external shuffle enabled, we have observed that if a very large no. of blocks are being fetched from a remote host, it puts the NM under extra pressure and can crash it. This change introduces a configuration `spark.reducer.maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress` , to limit the no. of map outputs being fetched from a given remote address. The changes applied here are applicable for both the scenarios - when external shuffle is enabled as well as disabled. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the job with the default configuration which does not change the existing behavior and ran it with few configurations of lower values -10,20,50,100. The job ran fine and there is no change in the output. (I will update the metrics related to NM in some time.)","created_at":"2017-06-30T13:07:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T15:38:57Z","closed_at":"2017-07-19T20:56:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56d100d7ba84d95c38bdc0c83869f69e28550127","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6e5f6b675073dd2ed9f155c847bde61ebc1e3bf","head":{"label":"dhruve:impr/SPARK-21243","ref":"impr/SPARK-21243","sha":"e6e5f6b675073dd2ed9f155c847bde61ebc1e3bf","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFew changes to the Structured Streaming documentation\r\n- Clarify that the entire stream input table is not materialized\r\n- Add information for Ganglia\r\n- Add Kafka Sink to the main docs\r\n- Removed a couple of leftover experimental tags\r\n- Added more associated reading material and talk videos.\r\n\r\nIn addition, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16856 broke the link to the RDD programming guide in several places while renaming the page. This PR fixes those @sameeragarwal @cloud-fan. \r\n- Added a redirection to avoid breaking internal and possible external links.\r\n- Removed unnecessary redirection pages that were there since the separate scala, java, and python programming guides were merged together in 2013 or 2014. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor performance reasons, `UnsafeRow.getString`, `getStruct`, etc. return a \"pointer\" that points to a memory region of this unsafe row. This makes the unsafe projection a little dangerous, because all of its output rows share one instance.\r\n\r\nWhen we implement SQL operators, we should be careful to not cache the input rows because they may be produced by unsafe projection from child operator and thus its content may change overtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we updating values of InternalRow(e.g. in mutable projection and safe projection), we only copy UTF8String, we should also copy InternalRow, ArrayData and MapData. This PR fixes this, and also fixes the copy of vairous InternalRow, ArrayData and MapData implementations.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe currently implement statistics propagation directly in logical plan. Given we already have two different implementations, it'd make sense to actually decouple the two and add stats propagation using mixin. This would reduce the coupling between logical plan and statistics handling.\r\n\r\nThis can also be a powerful pattern in the future to add additional properties (e.g. constraints).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be covered by existing test cases.","created_at":"2017-06-30T06:33:32Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T11:49:47Z","closed_at":"2017-07-01T04:12:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9a32bb134ad7a4fd563d13fd46d99036229e101","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c32d2507d3f4f269e17e841a4a4e4920b35a5e9","head":{"label":"rxin:stats-trait","ref":"stats-trait","sha":"9c32d2507d3f4f269e17e841a4a4e4920b35a5e9","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new configuration option `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.size` to the configuration docs to specify the capacity of the spark listener bus event queue. Default value is 10000.\r\n\r\nThis is doc PR for [SPARK-15703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15703).\r\n\r\nI added option to the `Scheduling` section, however it might be more related to `Spark UI` section.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually verified correct rendering of configuration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`WindowExec` currently improperly stores complex objects (UnsafeRow, UnsafeArrayData, UnsafeMapData, UTF8String) during aggregation by keeping a reference in the buffer used by `GeneratedMutableProjections` to the actual input data. Things go wrong when the input object (or the backing bytes) are reused for other things. This could happen in window functions when it starts spilling to disk. When reading the back the spill files the `UnsafeSorterSpillReader` reuses the buffer to which the `UnsafeRow` points, leading to weird corruption scenario's. Note that this only happens for aggregate functions that preserve (parts of) their input, for example `FIRST`, `LAST`, `MIN` & `MAX`.\r\n\r\nThis was not seen before, because the spilling logic was not doing actual spills as much and actually used an in-memory page. This page was not cleaned up during window processing and made sure unsafe objects point to their own dedicated memory location. This was changed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16909, after this PR Spark spills more eagerly.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a surgical fix because we are close to releasing Spark 2.2. This change just makes sure that there cannot be any object reuse at the expensive of a little bit of performance. We will follow-up with a more subtle solution at a later point.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to `DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2017-06-29T22:08:29Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T06:45:15Z","closed_at":"2017-06-30T04:36:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88447d76b5ab2bb93987b35da20b94dd480dc215","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e30ae5222e8a55416dac5c5672e33177b0b063b","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-21258","ref":"SPARK-21258","sha":"7e30ae5222e8a55416dac5c5672e33177b0b063b","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new class `OnHeapCachedBatch` class, which can have compressed data by using `CompressibleColumnAccessor`, derived from `ColumnVector` class.\r\n\r\nAs first step of this implementation, this JIRA supports primitive data and string types. Another PR will support array and other data types.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation adds compressed data by using `putByteArray()` method, and then gets data by using a getter (e.g. `getInt()`).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a retry for #18320. This PR was reverted due to unexpected test failures with -10 error code. \r\n\r\nI was unable to reproduce in MacOS, CentOS and Ubuntu but only in Jenkins. So, the tests proceeded to verify this and revert the past try here - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18456\r\n\r\nThis new approach was tested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463.\r\n\r\n**Test results**:\r\n\r\n- With the part of suspicious change in the past try (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463/commits/466325d3fd353668583f3bde38ae490d9db0b189)\r\n  \r\n  Tests ran 4 times and 2 times passed and 2 time failed.\r\n\r\n- Without the part of suspicious change in the past try (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463/commits/466325d3fd353668583f3bde38ae490d9db0b189)\r\n\r\n  Tests ran 5 times and they all passed.\r\n\r\n- With this new approach (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463/commits/0a7589c09f53dfc2094497d8d3e59d6407569417)\r\n\r\n  Tests ran 5 times and they all passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks the cause is as below (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463/commits/466325d3fd353668583f3bde38ae490d9db0b189):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n+ exitCode <- 1\r\n...\r\n+   data <- parallel:::readChild(child)\r\n+   if (is.raw(data)) {\r\n+     if (unserialize(data) == exitCode) {\r\n      ...\r\n+     }\r\n+   }\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n- parallel:::mcexit(0L)\r\n+ parallel:::mcexit(0L, send = exitCode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo possibilities I think\r\n\r\n - `parallel:::mcexit(.. , send = exitCode)`\r\n   \r\n   https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mcfork.html\r\n\r\n   > It sends send to the master (unless NULL) and then shuts down the child process.\r\n\r\n   However, it looks possible that the parent attemps to terminate the child right after getting our custom exit code. So, the child gets terminated between \"send\" and \"shuts down\", failing to exit properly.\r\n\r\n - A bug between `parallel:::mcexit(..., send = ...)` and `parallel:::readChild`.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**:\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, I simply decided to avoid both possibilities with this new approach here (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18465/commits/9ff89a7859cb9f427fc774f33c3521c7d962b723). To support this idea, I explained with some quotation of the documentation as below:\r\n\r\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mcfork.html\r\n\r\n> `readChild` and `readChildren` return a raw vector with a \"pid\" attribute if data were available, an integer vector of length one with the process ID if a child terminated or `NULL` if the child no longer exists (no children at all for `readChildren`).\r\n\r\n`readChild` returns \"an integer vector of length one with the process ID if a child terminated\" so we can check if it is `integer` and the same selected \"process ID\". I believe this makes sure that the children are exited.\r\n\r\nIn case that children happen to send any data manually to parent (which is why we introduced the suspicious part of the change (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18463/commits/466325d3fd353668583f3bde38ae490d9db0b189)), this should be raw bytes and will be discarded (and then will try to read the next and check if it is `integer` in the next loop).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests and Jenkins tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-29T09:14:43Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:42Z","closed_at":"2017-07-08T21:27:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ced4c8dc0a6749bdd6af2301a3ccbf5118a9f4a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18465/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18465/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18465/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c08ccd59f438fce1f841aa70f760ffb9dc24cf50","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21093-retry-1","ref":"SPARK-21093-retry-1","sha":"c08ccd59f438fce1f841aa70f760ffb9dc24cf50","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an effort to reduce the difference between Hive and Spark. Spark supports case-sensitivity in columns. Especially, for Struct types, with `spark.sql.caseSensitive=true`, the following is supported.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select named_struct('a', 1, 'A', 2).a\").show\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|named_struct(a, 1, A, 2).a|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|                         1|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select named_struct('a', 1, 'A', 2).A\").show\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|named_struct(a, 1, A, 2).A|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|                         2|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd vice versa, with `spark.sql.caseSensitive=false`, the following is supported.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select named_struct('a', 1).A, named_struct('A', 1).a\").show\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n|named_struct(a, 1).A|named_struct(A, 1).a|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n|                   1|                   1|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, types are considered different.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntegrate Apache Arrow with Spark to increase performance of `DataFrame.toPandas`.  This has been done by using Arrow to convert data partitions on the executor JVM to Arrow payload byte arrays where they are then served to the Python process.  The Python DataFrame can then collect the Arrow payloads where they are combined and converted to a Pandas DataFrame.  Data types except complex, date, timestamp, and decimal  are currently supported, otherwise an `UnsupportedOperation` exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nAdditions to Spark include a Scala package private method `Dataset.toArrowPayload` that will convert data partitions in the executor JVM to `ArrowPayload`s as byte arrays so they can be easily served.  A package private class/object `ArrowConverters` that provide data type mappings and conversion routines.  In Python, a private method `DataFrame._collectAsArrow` is added to collect Arrow payloads and a SQLConf \"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enable\" can be used in `toPandas()` to enable using Arrow (uses the old conversion by default).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test suite `ArrowConvertersSuite` that will run tests on conversion of Datasets to Arrow payloads for supported types.  The suite will generate a Dataset and matching Arrow JSON data, then the dataset is converted to an Arrow payload and finally validated against the JSON data.  This will ensure that the schema and data has been converted correctly.\r\n\r\nAdded PySpark tests to verify the `toPandas` method is producing equal DataFrames with and without pyarrow.  A roundtrip test to ensure the pandas DataFrame produced by pyspark is equal to a one made directly with pandas.","created_at":"2017-06-28T17:48:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T03:44:24Z","closed_at":"2017-07-10T22:23:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aba5d23a4ece8112a876b7b5d5138a621683008b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26dfc82896c3d2a5178b34e46162b3cc06ea8f2a","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:toPandas_with_arrow-SPARK-13534","ref":"toPandas_with_arrow-SPARK-13534","sha":"26dfc82896c3d2a5178b34e46162b3cc06ea8f2a","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

in Pyspark.\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nStreamingLinearRegressionWithSGD class in PySpark is missing the setIntercept Method which offers the possibility to turn on/off the intercept value. API parity is not respected between Python and Scala. We added the setIntercept Method to StreamingLinearRegressionWithSGD class which calls setIntercept Method in LinearRegressionModel class in order to turn on/off the intercept. A big thanks to Matthieu CANEILL for his precious help in solving this issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested by running all tests with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen data type is struct, InSet now uses TypeUtils.getInterpretedOrdering (similar to EqualTo) to build a TreeSet. In other cases it will use a HashSet as before (which should be faster). Similarly, In.eval uses Ordering.equiv instead of equals. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is kind of another follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18064 .\r\n\r\nIn #18064 , we wrap every SQL command with SQL execution, which makes nested SQL execution very likely to happen. #18419 trid to improve it a little bit, by introduing `SQLExecition.ignoreNestedExecutionId`. However, this is not friendly to data source developers, they may need to update their code to use this `ignoreNestedExecutionId` API.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new solution, to just allow nested execution. The downside is that, we may have multiple executions for one query. We can improve this by updating the data organization in SQLListener, to have 1-n mapping from query to execution, instead of 1-1 mapping. This can be done in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nwhen creating table like following:\r\n> create table timestamp_test(id int(11), time_stamp timestamp not null default current_timestamp);\r\n\r\nThe result of Excuting \"insert into timestamp_test values (111, null)\" is different between Spark and JDBC.\r\n```\r\nmysql> select * from timestamp_test;\r\n+------+---------------------+\r\n| id   | time_stamp          |\r\n+------+---------------------+\r\n|  111 | 1970-01-01 00:00:00 | -> spark\r\n|  111 | 2017-06-27 19:32:38 | -> mysql\r\n+------+---------------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n   Because in such case ```StructField.nullable``` is false, so the generated codes of ```InvokeLike``` and ```BoundReference``` don't check whether the field is null or not. Instead, they directly use ```CodegenContext.INPUT_ROW.getLong(1)```, however, ```UnsafeRow.setNullAt(1)``` will put 0 in the underlying memory.\r\n   \r\n   The PR will ```always``` set ```StructField.nullable```  true after obtaining metadata from jdbc connection, Since we can insert null to not null timestamp column in MySQL. In this way, spark will propagate null to underlying DB engine, and let DB to choose how to process NULL.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the reopen of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14198, with merge conflicts resolved. \r\n\r\n@ueshin Could you please take a look at my code?\r\n\r\nFix bugs about types that result an array of null when creating DataFrame using python.\r\n\r\nPython's array.array have richer type than python itself, e.g. we can have `array('f',[1,2,3])` and `array('d',[1,2,3])`. Codes in spark-sql and pyspark didn't take this into consideration which might cause a problem that you get an array of null values when you have `array('f')` in your rows.\r\n\r\nA simple code to reproduce this bug is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext,Row,DataFrame\r\nfrom array import array\r\n\r\nsc = SparkContext()\r\nsqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\r\n\r\nrow1 = Row(floatarray=array('f',[1,2,3]), doublearray=array('d',[1,2,3]))\r\nrows = sc.parallelize([ row1 ])\r\ndf = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rows)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich have output\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---------------+------------------+\r\n|    doublearray|        floatarray|\r\n+---------------+------------------+\r\n|[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]|[null, null, null]|\r\n+---------------+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDisable installing pyarrow during run pip tests, this was causing flakiness due to the conda-forge binstar -> conda migration and our out of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Implement a new commit protocol `HadoopMapRedCommitProtocol` which support the old `mapred` package's committer;\r\n- Refactor SparkHadoopWriter and SparkHadoopMapReduceWriter, now they are combined together, thus we can support write through both mapred and mapreduce API by the new SparkHadoopWriter, a lot of duplicated codes are removed.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, it should be pretty easy for us to support the committer from both the new and the old hadoop API at high level.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNo major behavior change, passed the existing test cases.","created_at":"2017-06-27T15:57:32Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T14:50:31Z","closed_at":"2017-06-30T12:33:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e274fa84a1a61760adaf9b94b5c7f0d67148939","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b6729a76f4ef53b6bb742d7ec8be60e1bb7c640","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:SparkHadoopWriter","ref":"SparkHadoopWriter","sha":"4b6729a76f4ef53b6bb742d7ec8be60e1bb7c640","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPlease see also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21176\r\n\r\nThis change limits the number of selector threads that jetty creates to maximum 8 per proxy servlet (Jetty default is number of processors / 2).\r\nThe newHttpClient for Jettys ProxyServlet class is overwritten to avoid the Jetty defaults (which are designed for high-performance http servers).\r\nOnce https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/1643 is available, the code could be cleaned up to avoid the method override.\r\n\r\nI really need this on v2.1.1 - what is the best way for a backport automatic merge works fine)? Shall I create another PR?\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\nThe patch was tested manually on a Spark cluster with a head node that has 88 processors using JMX to verify that the number of selector threads is now limited to 8 per proxy.\r\n\r\n@gurvindersingh @zsxwing can you please review the

Issue:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21225\r\n    In the function \"resourceOffers\", It declare a variable \"tasks\" for storage the tasks which have allocated a executor. It declared like this:\r\n`val tasks = shuffledOffers.map(o => new ArrayBuffer[TaskDescription](o.cores))` \r\n    But, I think this code only conside a situation for that one task per core. If the user set \"spark.task.cpus\" as 2 or 3, It really don't need so much Mem. I think It can motify as follow:\r\nval tasks = shuffledOffers.map(o => new ArrayBuffer[TaskDescription](o.cores / CPUS_PER_TASK))\r\n to instead.\r\n    Motify like this the other earning is that it's more easy to understand the way how the tasks allocate

It declared like this:\r\n\r\n`val tasks = shuffledOffers.map(o => new ArrayBuffer[TaskDescription](o.cores))`\r\n\r\nBut, I think this code only conside a situation for that one task per core. If the user set \"spark.task.cpus\" as 2 or 3, It really don't need so much Mem. I think It can motify as follow:\r\n`val tasks = shuffledOffers.map(o => new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition in the current TaskSetManager where a failed task is added for retry (addPendingTask), and can asynchronously be assigned to an executor *prior* to the blacklist state (updateBlacklistForFailedTask), the result is the task might re-execute on the same executor.  This is particularly problematic if the executor is shutting down since the retry task immediately becomes a lost task (ExecutorLostFailure).  Another side effect is that the actual failure reason gets obscured by the retry task which never actually executed.  There are sample logs showing the issue in the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21219 \r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the ordering of the addPendingTask and updatingBlackListForFailedTask calls in TaskSetManager.handleFailedTask\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImplemented a unit test that verifies the task is black listed before it is added to the pending task.  Ran the unit test without the fix and it fails.  Ran the unit test with the fix and it passes.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull
