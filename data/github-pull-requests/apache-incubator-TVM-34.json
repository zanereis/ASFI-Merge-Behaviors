small PR enhances generic conv2d TOPI schedules to be even more reusable.\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n1. Continues [PR #6714](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6714) and expose memory scope via ```mem_scope```\r\n2. Enhanches [schedule_conv_NCHWc_cpu_common_int8](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f3d3ecebe189af77ba3ac5163882591aaf67d8b3/python/tvm/topi/generic/conv2d.py#L124) and

memory scope remains \"global\" by default.\r\n\r\n#### Goal:\r\n\r\nFlexibility and reusability of key generic schedules is desirable for targets, especially custom ISA/ASIC.\r\nThere are use-cases where cache memory is not directly visible (\"local\") but generic TOPI is still very useful as-is.\r\n\r\n---\r\nCc @masahi , @vinx13 , @ZihengJiang please help with the review.\r\n\r\nThank

was failing compilation in case the input channels divided by 4 was less than 4.\r\n\r\nThis was because we were splitting this axis by a factor of 4 to create appropriate loop nest for tensorize, but then tensorize was assuming that the outer axis bound was divisible by 4.\r\n\r\nIf the outer bound was less than 4, compilation failed, if it was greater than 4 but not divisible by 4, we were occasionally accessing data outside of tensor, which luckily was padded due to alignment (I think).\r\n\r\nSo here we make sure that we explicitly pad the input axis such that the outer loop will always be divisible by 4.\r\n\r\nThere are also some refactors to test_topi_conv2d_int8.py:\r\n- decouple the tests using pytest.parametrize\r\n- extend the NHWC int8 schedules test to test against Arm targets and various schedules. When these schedules were initially added, we didn't have Arm CI, so only compilation was tested, now we can also run the workloads on Arm targets.","created_at":"2022-12-28T09:56:50Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T07:32:01Z","closed_at":"2022-12-31T23:18:22Z","merged_at":"2022-12-31T23:18:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"579c9708c662e52a287ac390c11ce76b790a7b58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2f2ecafe9174ef63b70111a6fbccdf0b66e2b508","head":{"label":"ekalda:dotprod-schedule-bugfix","ref":"dotprod-schedule-bugfix","sha":"2f2ecafe9174ef63b70111a6fbccdf0b66e2b508","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215831751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU4MzE3NTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ekalda/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda/tvm","description":"Open

PR brings the support for specifying axis dtype when creating `tir::Layout`.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the construction of `tir::Layout` uses int32 for every axis. With this specification, the output of `BijectiveLayout::ForwardShape/BackwardShape(...)` will always be int32 shape, no matter if the input shape is in int32 or int64.\r\n\r\nAs we will be gradually moving to int64 default dtype for tensor shapes, there are increasingly more cases where we need to handle int64 shapes. Thus, `tir::Layout` need some updates for int64 shapes. Since the creation of an `tir::Layout` instance is agnostic to the dtype of the shapes that the instance will handle later, one way of the such updates is to add a dtype parameter to the constructor of `tir::Layout`, to specify the dtype explicitly. This PR enhances `tir::Layout` in this way, with appropriate unit tests for dtype check.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen

is possible to disable specific passes through the \"disabled_pass\" parameter in the Pass Context. These \"disabled\" passes can be optional for one target and mandatory for another one.\r\nSince lookup table for some QNN operations (tanh, round and etc.) is calculated on the host and some of disabled passes can be required for the host, no need to disable these passes. This constant calculation/ evaluation is orthogonal to the compilation process for specific target.\r\n\r\n**What was changed:**\r\nThis commit creates its own compilation Pass Context for lookup

this PR, we add support for AMX(Advanced Matrix Extensions) through Tensor intrinsics;\r\n\r\nwe chose to enabled the AMX support and INT8 intrinsics and dense op at first, which includes:\r\n1. Add building options and LLVM AMX intrinsic target detection ;\r\n2. Register a global AMX init and config function;\r\n3. LLVM AMX intrinsic integrated as Tensor intrinsic (1 for microkernel computation and 1 for accumulation tile store);\r\n4. Add test case on u8s8s32 matmul usding the AMX Tensor intrinsics;\r\n5. Integration of int8 dense kernel,  testcase also added;\r\n\r\nBF16 and more op are going to be considered in the future.","created_at":"2022-12-19T09:59:27Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T05:34:17Z","closed_at":"2023-01-05T05:34:14Z","merged_at":"2023-01-05T05:34:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"07a5a9eadb44ec9303fcea2369b2cf1a90a383b9","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/94223634b29f66357753e7a3cd7eebe68820c6c1","head":{"label":"Qianshui-Jiang:amx_int8_dev","ref":"amx_int8_dev","sha":"94223634b29f66357753e7a3cd7eebe68820c6c1","user":{"login":"Qianshui-Jiang","id":77087941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDg3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77087941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":495295320,"node_id":"R_kgDOHYWbWA","name":"tvm","full_name":"Qianshui-Jiang/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Qianshui-Jiang","id":77087941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDg3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77087941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qianshui-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Qianshui-Jiang/tvm","description":"Open

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12515, const folding on fp16, when both lhs and rhs are constant, is disabled. This is the case even when one of the arguments are one or zero. This leads to a real problem described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13532#issuecomment-1353715208. So in practice, compiling winograd fp16 on GPU is currently broken. \r\n\r\nThis PR enables trivial algebraic simplification for fp16 const folding when (1) both arguments are constant and (2) one or both of the inputs are one or zero. Since we already do such simplification for any dtype when only one of the inputs are constant (for example https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/3a639a41a830ece914df10a98f807123e46cd750/src/arith/const_fold.h#L209-L216), I just removed all early exit `return NullOpt` for fp16 cases and use the code path like above to simplify `0h * 2.5h` to `0h` etc.\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @wrongtest-intellif @Lunderberg

PR tries to fix the crash of parser when the old value of a var is an array but the new value is not. For example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\ndef func_wrapper(shape, dtype):\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def test_case():\r\n        a = T.alloc_buffer(shape, dtype=dtype)\r\n    \r\n    return test_case\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    a = np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=\"int8\")\r\n    print(func_wrapper((256, 256), dtype=\"int8\").script())\r\n```\r\nIn the above code, there are two assignment to var 'a'. In the global scope, its value is a numpy array. But it is a Buffer in the prim function. There is a table named 'name2value' to track the value of vars like 'a' here.\r\nWhen the parser wants to update its value, it will compare the value between the new and the old assignment. Here the problem comes. When we use '==' to compare an array with a value, the result is an array too, which can not be used as a condition of a if stmt directly. So, the code above will emit an error:\r\n```shell\r\nerror: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.

PR tries to fix the crash of parser when the old value of a var is an array but the new value is not. For example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\ndef func_wrapper(shape, dtype):\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def test_case():\r\n        a = T.alloc_buffer(shape, dtype=dtype)\r\n    \r\n    return test_case\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    a = np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=\"int8\")\r\n    print(func_wrapper((256, 256), dtype=\"int8\").script())\r\n```\r\nIn the above code, there are two assignment to var 'a'. In the global scope, its value is a numpy array. But it is a Buffer in the prim function. There is a table named 'name2value' to track the value of vars like 'a' here.\r\nWhen the parser wants to update its value, it will compare the value between the new and the old assignment. Here the problem comes. When we use '==' to compare an array with a value, the result is an array too, which can not be used as a condition of a if stmt directly. So, the code above will emit an error:\r\n```shell\r\nerror: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\r\n --> /workspace/code_newest/tvm/private_test/test_meta_programming.py:16:9\r\n    |  \r\n 16 |          a = T.alloc_buffer(shape, dtype=dtype)\r\n    |

is very useful for creating a TensorIR program that is otherwise hard to so via manual TVMScript or te compute + `create_prim_func`. \r\n\r\nA good example is a TensorIR program having `AllocateConst`, since it is not possible to create such modules with embedded constants via TVMScript parsing. `AllocateConst` has been the source of many issues and I've sent many fixes for them, but it has always been difficult to create test cases for such issues. But if we start from Relay, we can easily create such modules by lowering Relay func to TIR with `link-params = True`.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it possible to, say, author a complicated module in PyTorch and directly lower it to TensorIR. \r\n\r\nAs an example of its use, I added a regression test for the issue described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13605.\r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy @junrushao

is supposed to change only the order in which buffers are visited, but the created `buffer_alloc_recorder_` misses buffers associated with `AllocateConst` nodes. These buffers are not part of `func->buffer_map`, and appear only in `read` or `match_buffer` regions, so they are not caught by existing visitors for `BufferLoadNode` and `BufferStoreNode`.\r\n\r\nSince constant buffers are not correctly handled by `PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation` now, tuning on Hexagon is currently broken with this error. This PR fixes this.\r\n\r\n```\r\nE             File \"/home/fparizi/src/tvm_src/src/tir/transforms/plan_update_buffer_allocation_location.cc\", line 163\r\nE           TVMError: \r\nE

false:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince creating a TVMScript-based test case involving constant buffers (`AllocateConst`) is difficult, I hope we can merge this simple PR without a test case.\r\n\r\ncc

is a simple rewrite of hand-coded top-k function used for CPU targets. \r\n\r\nThe old implementation sorted each axis and then took the biggest k elements.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation does a single pass of each axis, keeping a min heap to store the top-k elements up to that point. \r\n\r\nIf n is the size of the array, and we want to find top k, the old implementation has runtime in O(nlogn) with additional memory O(n) to store the sorted array. The new implementation is O(n log k), and in practice is probably amortized to O(n / k * log k) in many scenarios and only requires O(k). Note n >> k most of the time.\r\n\r\nIn practice this new kernel led to a 20x speedup over existing one. On a Xeon Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz for input shape [1, 3050] with k = 15, the latency went from 200us --> ~10us. There is probably more room for shaving off a little more time on the scale of a single us's, however I have determined it to not be worth it. \r\n\r\nThis change however is probably in the range of worth committing.\r\n\r\nI've launched benchmarks on my m1 mac, and a Xeon Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz with 8 cores.\r\n\r\n**Data:**\r\nAll data is collected **_along axis=1._**\r\n\r\nM1:\r\ninput_shape | k | onnx_ms | tvm_new_ms | tvm_old_ms | tvm_speedup\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n(1, 128) | 1 | 0.004760980606 | 0.00318288 | 0.00587965 |

current implementation of `CombineParallelDense` is hardcoded to slice along the last axis after the combined dense. I hit an error using this pass on the stable diffusion UNet, since it has a combined group where the dense is followed by `expand_dims` which changes the slicing axis (see https://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/stable-diffusion/compile.py for repro)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  %76 = concatenate(%74) /* ty=Tensor[(20160, 1280), float32] */;\r\n  %79 = concatenate(%77) /* ty=Tensor[(20160), float32] */;\r\n  %78 = nn.dense(%75, %76, units=20160) /* ty=Tensor[(2, 20160), float32] */;\r\n  %80 = nn.bias_add(%78, %79, axis=-1) /* ty=Tensor[(2, 20160), float32] */;\r\n  %81 = expand_dims(%80, axis=2) /* ty=Tensor[(2, 20160, 1), float32] */;\r\n  %82 = expand_dims(%81, axis=3) /* ty=Tensor[(2, 20160, 1, 1), float32] */;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe correct way to generate `strided_slice`:\r\n```\r\n  %84 = strided_slice(%82, begin=[0, 0, 0, 0], end=[-1, 320, -1, -1], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], slice_mode=\"size\", axes=None) /* ty=Tensor[(2, 320, 1, 1), float32] */;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAs I documented in the code, this fix is probably not 100% fail-proof. I think this is a difficult problem, since it requires tracking how the original output-channel axis of the combined dense moves across shape-changing operations like `reshape /transpose / split`. But this is at least \"more correct\" than the current implementation, so I'm submitting this fix as is for now.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, `CombineParallelDense` works successfully on the stable diffusion UNet, and it reduces the number of `nn.dense` from 184 to 100.\r\n\r\n@wrongtest-intellif @comaniac @vinx13

investigated TIR kernel tuning by meta-scheduler and prepared for it the python script with minimal imports from tvm.\r\nThere is sketch of my code:\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import meta_schedule as ms\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass MyModule:\r\n  @T.prim_func\r\n  def main(...):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n  # params init\r\n  ...\r\n  database = ms.database.JSONDatabase(\r\n    workload_path,\r\n    record_path,\r\n    work_dir=work_dir,\r\n    module_equality=\"ignore-ndarray\",\r\n  )\r\n  ms.tir_integration.tune_tir(\r\n    mod=MyModule,\r\n    target=target,\r\n    work_dir=work_dir,\r\n    max_trials_global=trials_number,\r\n    database=database,\r\n    strategy=\"replay-trace\",\r\n  )\r\n```\r\nBut it has failed due to [check](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/meta_schedule/space_generator/space_generator.cc#L28) on native side of space generator. It tried to get packed func from tvm.topi.x86.utils.target_has_vnni, but it is not registrated in my case.\r\nOf course, the simplest fix is to add `from tvm.topi.x86.utils import target_has_vnni` or `from tvm import topi` or `from tvm import relay` to python tuning script. But as a client of TIR and meta scheduler high-level API I do not need to know internal context. As result I've fixed it inside TVM.\r\nThe main fix is `from tvm import relay` in ms.relay_integration module. I should note that it does it by its-self if TYPE_CHECKING=True (but looks like it always False). Other code is related to hidding `from tvm.meta_schedule import is_meta_schedule_enabled` due to circular python imports.","created_at":"2022-12-12T17:24:02Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T20:22:03Z","closed_at":"2025-02-06T20:22:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/56712afc7574ad932612287f4499f7862270d92c","head":{"label":"Deelvin:vc/fix_circular_imports","ref":"vc/fix_circular_imports","sha":"56712afc7574ad932612287f4499f7862270d92c","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13545\r\n\r\nThe pattern of `dense -> add`, where the add is really bias addition, can appear often as the result of converting ONNX `Gemm` op:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/edfeba5c3a2caf133d2d045d1c4d99f5c34aeb69/python/tvm/relay/frontend/onnx.py#L1409\r\n\r\nCurrently, FQ2I tries to convert this `add` to `qnn.add`. But if this add is being used for bias addition, `out_t.scale` and `out_t.zero_point` variables in `fake_quantization_to_integer.py`, which are used to initialize the output scale and zp of the QNN binary operators, can be tensors rather than scalars. QNN binary operators do not support such output qparams, which led to the error reported in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13545.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, apparently we haven't supported converting `dense -> add` to `qnn.dense -> add -> requantize`, when `add` is a bias add, in FQ2I. The pattern of `dense -> nn.bias_add` can be converted to `qnn.dense -> nn.bias_add -> requantize`, but we never use `nn.bias_add` after `dense`.\r\n\r\nSo I added a code path in the FQ2I QNN binary op converter, to identify such patterns and use regular binary ops rather than QNN ones.\r\n\r\ncc @AndrewZhaoLuo @Icemist @elvin-n

the Docker images in the Jenkinsfiles has the downside that only trusted changes are actually run in CI. Since Docker image updates are pretty frequent, this makes for a pretty bad UX (e.g. CI runs but doesn't actually test the PR). The fix here makes it so the images are read from a different file during CI execution so updates from anyone are picked up.\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates the need to use the batch jobs in Jenkins to update Docker images. Docker images are built as part of post-merge CI on `main` and anyone can trigger a validation run by filing a PR with changed Docker tags.","created_at":"2022-12-07T05:02:21Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T00:08:55Z","closed_at":"2022-12-09T00:08:52Z","merged_at":"2022-12-09T00:08:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5b8ab2307e8efe84babbe203e2b6893d57e2a9e","assignee":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7f7280f2fb8c4f869d6ae008fcc4af6feb27b927","head":{"label":"driazati:dyn_docker_updates","ref":"dyn_docker_updates","sha":"7f7280f2fb8c4f869d6ae008fcc4af6feb27b927","user":{"login":"driazati","id":9407960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDc5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9407960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati","html_url":"https://github.com/driazati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":429563317,"node_id":"R_kgDOGZqdtQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"driazati/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"driazati","id":9407960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDc5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9407960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati","html_url":"https://github.com/driazati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driazati/followers","follo

PR added an annotation `meta_schedule.decompose_point` as a hint for `RewriteReductionBlock`. When the outer reduction loop has extent of 1, it won't be recognized as reduction loops and `decompose_reduction` won't be used. In some cases like tensorization, the init block need to be tensorized. In this case, `decompose_reduction` is necessary and such hint is helpful.\r\nAs part of `MultiLevelTilingTensorCore`, the outermost reduction loop is annotated with such hint.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao
