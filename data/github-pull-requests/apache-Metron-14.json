Edit `roles/mysql_server/defaults/main.yml` file and specify the Geolite DB URL for  `geodata_file` parameter. Note that this points to the Maxmind Geolite DB by default. You may leave this parameter unedited if a latest copy of the Maxmind Geolite DB is desired.\n2. Now run the deployment code and the specified geodata would be populated in the mysql server.\n\n**Test Scenario 2 - Specifying Geolite DB file manually**\n1. Copy the required Geolite db file to `roles/mysql_server/files/`\n2. Edit the `roles/mysql_server/defaults/main.yml` file and provide the name of the file to the parameter `geodata_file`\n3. Now run the deployment code and the specified geodata would be populated in the mysql server.\nNote :- A sample Geolite DB file called `geodata.tar.xz` is included in the  `roles/mysql_server/files/` directory along with this pull request for test purposes.\n\n**Testing Done**\n- Tested with single and multi node deployments on openstack\n- Tested both scenarios 1 and 2 above.\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T09:20:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T14:46:11Z","closed_at":"2016-09-30T14:46:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"368bc1eb14a77ca8db787d27069506694a9ae5f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/af90a23210a60a501b5c136e435337a6d39cd17a","head":{"label":"nsinha17:METRON-430","ref":"METRON-430","sha":"af90a23210a60a501b5c136e435337a6d39cd17a","user":{"login":"nsinha17","id":19325569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI1NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19325569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17","html_url":"https://github.com/nsinha17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68576702,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODU3NjcwMg==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"nsinha17/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsinha17","id":19325569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI1NTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19325569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17","html_url":"https://github.com/nsinha17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsinha17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsinha17/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

on Full Dev and Quick Dev.\n\nAmbari seems to have changed their response in 2.4.0.1-1, if you request \"START ALL\" on a cluster where all services are already started, it doesn't actually make a request, so there is no request ID reported back.\n\nI also suppressed starting of the Yaf probe (because we don't run the parser topology for Yaf) and bumped java_home so Snort would work.\n\nI needed to separate the inventory directories for quick and full dev certain properties (in this case java_home) can lag between quick and full dev. \n\nNote- Full dev still doesn't come up cleanly after the build successfully completes due to what looks like insufficient memory.

changes were required to make the Stellar Profiler Client API accessible from the Parser and Enrichment topologies.\n- Added the metron-profiler-client as a dependency to the Parser and Enrichment topologies so that the Uber jar contains the Profiler Client API.\n- Added a README for the metron-profiler-client to describe its usage.\n- Pushing the metron-profiler-client archive to the Metron host to make the library accessible to the Stellar Shell.\n- Fixed an issue with potentially unsafe String to Bytes conversion that may cause issues on different platforms.\n\nThese changes can be manually tested by following the Getting Started instructions included in both the metron-profiler/README.md and metron-profiler-client/README.md.\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T14:29:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T21:41:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-30T21:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a7cfb2751f43e2aff603aecc4935e21328c2f43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/a0a61efbb5d6b4394b15071427ee54bc1dc5abc6","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-421","ref":"METRON-421","sha":"a0a61efbb5d6b4394b15071427ee54bc1dc5abc6","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

is an initial cut at an MVP for the Ambari Management Pack.  Most of the ground work was completed in other Jiras (detailed in METRON-427 description).  This takes that work, adds the enrichment portion similiar to indexing, elasticsearch, etc., and bundles it in an mpack.\n\nThis includes end to end from creating appropriate Kafka topics, preloading a MySQL database with GeoIP data for enrichment, and making it available to an Elasticsearch and Kibana instance. ES is optional, and can be redirected to an outside instance.\n\nThe directory structuring changed to reflect the mpack MVP, and accordingly a lot of files got moved/renamed.  For most of the ground work, there are various fixes and tweaks for consistency to each other and to fix bugs found during testing.\n\nDetailed instructions are found in the metron-deployment README.md in the 'Ambari Management Pack' section.  Essentially these steps are:\n- Build the RPMs per the previously existing instructions (make sure to run the main build first).\n- Build the mpack using the metron-deployment POM. From metron-deployment just run `mvn clean package -DskipTests`.  This will produce an mpack tar.gz, which is what will be used in the installation to the Ambari server.\n- Place the RPMs in /localrepo on the nodes.  We don't have remote RPMs yet, so this is a necessary evil that will go away.\n- Place the mpack file on the ambari-server node.\n- Install the mpack with `ambari-server` install-mpack --mpack=<mpack_location> --verbose`\n- Update Storm's configuration in Ambari for topology.classpath to /etc/hbase/conf:/etc/hadoop/conf.  Ideally this will be automated after this MVP.\n- Run through the normal Ambari install process.  There are some caveats about this (colocation of Metron services isn't enforced, and Storm + Kafka + HBase client need to be available).  More details are in the README, but just make sure Storm + Kafka + HBase client are available and that you aren't installing to a node with MySQL already installed.  The MySQL issue is most likely on a single node install\n- Use the action to install Elasticsearch templates where you can start / stop services.\n\nThis was tested on an AWS cluster, and on a set of Docker instances where a lot of components (e.g. MapReduce) disabled to avoid memory issues.\n\nSteps used on Docker were (the server and agent images already have most of the unnecessary components disabled.  Make sure to change jleet to your user home:\n`docker-machine rm default`\n`docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-disk-size \"51200\" --virtualbox-memory \"8192\" default`\n\n`docker-machine start default`\n`eval $(docker-machine env default)`\n`git clone https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-ambari`\n`cd docker-ambari`\n`. ambari-functions`\n`export AMBARI_SERVER_IMAGE=dlyle65535/ambari-server:2.4.0.1-jdk8`\n`export AMBARI_AGENT_IMAGE=dlyle65535/ambari-agent:2.4.0.1-jdk8`\n\n`export DOCKER_OPTS=\"-v /Users/jleet:/home/host -v /Users/jleet/Documents/workspace/incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch:/localrepo -v /Users/jleet/Documents/workspace/incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/target/:/mpack\"`\n\n(mac only) `sudo route add -net 172.17.0.0/16 $(docker-machine ip default)`\n\n`amb-start-cluster 5`\n`amb-shell`\n    `blueprint add --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlyle65535/ambari-rest-client/docker-metron-test/src/main/resources/blueprints/docker-metron`\n    `cluster build --blueprint docker-metron`\n    `cluster assign --host amb1.service.consul --hostGroup master_1`\n    `cluster assign --host amb2.service.consul --hostGroup master_2`\n    `cluster assign --host amb3.service.consul --hostGroup master_3`\n    `cluster assign --host amb4.service.consul --hostGroup master_4`\n    `cluster create`\n<WAIT FOR CLUSTER CREATION TO COMPLETE AND ^C TO EXIT>\n\nTo grab the IP for the Ambari Server (to be able to hit the UI):\n`docker inspect amb-server | grep -m1 \\\"IPAddress\\\"`.  It's probably 172.17.0.3\n\n`docker exec -it amb-server bash`\n`ambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/mpack/metron_mpack-1.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz --verbose`\n`ambari-server restart`\nhttp://<amb-server IP from before>:8080 - install Metron service on amb4.service.consul\n    es_url: can be invalid for test purpose otherwise, use authentic \n               Can use Docker to run a separate ES instance.  More likely to be stable and responsive given the memory concerns - `docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 elasticsearch -Des.cluster.name=metron`\n    Storm UI Server: amb1.service.consul:8744\n\nLimitations of the MVP (also detailed in README)\n- MySQL install should be optional (and allow for using an existing instance).\n- MySQL should not be installed on a node already running a MySQL instance (e.g. an Ambari Server using MySQL as its database).\n- There is currently no hosting for RPMs remotely.  They will have to be built locally.\n- Colocation of appropriate services should be enforced by Ambari.  See [#Installing Management Pack] for more details.\n- Storm's topology.classpath is not updated with the Metron service install and needs to be updated separately.\n- Several configuration parameters used when installing the Metron service could (and should) be grabbed from Ambari.  Install will require them to be manually entered.\n- Need to handle upgrading Metron\n- Different versions of CentOS apparently have different named for MySQL, so we may have to adjust

The Stellar DSL (domain specific language) is used to act upon streaming data within Apache Storm. It is difficult to troubleshoot Stellar when it can only be executed within a Storm topology.

builds on efforts from [https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/217](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/217)\n\nThis closes [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-257)\n\nThe purpose for this PR is to give the user the ability to specify how many records per file should be written by the PCAP CLI tool. For example, if 1,000 records are returned by a PCAP query and the user specifies 200 records per file, then the user should expect 5 PCAP files to be written to the current working directory.\n\nNote - I tested this on quick-dev\n\n**Testing**\nGet PCAP data into Metron: Install and setup pycapa - the instructions below reference/mirror those in [PR-93](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/93#issue-151705836)\n1. Install the pycapa library & utility `$ cd /opt/pycapa/pycapa && pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup.py install`\n2. (if using singlenode vagrant) Kill the enrichment and sensor topologies via for i in bro enrichment yaf snort;do storm kill $i;done\n3. Start the pcap topology via /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh\n4. Start the pycapa packet capture producer on eth1 via /usr/bin/pycapa --producer --topic pcap -i eth1 -k node1:6667\n5. Watch the topology in the Storm UI and kill the packet capture utility from before, when the number of packets ingested is over 3k.\n6. Ensure that at at least 3 files exist on HDFS by running hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap\n7. Choose a file (denoted by $FILE) and dump a few of the contents using the pcap_inspector utility via /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/pcap_inspector.sh -i $FILE -n 5\n8. Choose one of the lines and note the protocol.\n9. Note that when you run the commands below, the resulting file will be placed in the execution directory where you kicked off the job from.\n### Fixed filter\n1. Run a fixed filter query by executing the following command with the values noted above (match your start_time format to the date format provided - default is to use millis since epoch)\n2. `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/pcap_query.sh fixed -st <start_time> -df \"yyyyMMdd\" -p <protocol_num> -rpf 500`\n3. Verify the MR job finishes successfully. Upon completion, you should see multiple files named with relatively current datestamps in your current directory, e.g. pcap-data-20160617160549737+0000.pcap\n4. Copy the files to your local machine and verify you can them it in Wireshark. I chose a middle file and the last file. The middle file should have 500 records (per the records_per_file option), and the last one will likely have a number of records <= 500.\n### Query filter\n1. Run a Stellar query filter query by executing a command similar to the following, with the values noted above (match your start_time format to the date format provided - default is to use millis since epoch)\n2. `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/bin/pcap_query.sh query -st \"20160617\" -df \"yyyyMMdd\" -query \"protocol == '6'\"  -rpf 500`\n3. Verify the MR job finishes successfully. Upon completion, you should see multiple files named with relatively current datestamps in your current directory, e.g. pcap-data-20160617160549737+0000.pcap\n4. Copy the files to your local machine and verify you can them it in Wireshark. I chose a middle file and the last file.

METRON-417, the goal is to use HBase's TTL mechanism to expire or age-out Profile data. This PR is another step toward that goal.\n\nThis PR alters the mechanism that maps tuples to HBase so that a TTL can be specified in a generic way. Each tuple is capable of being written to HBase with its own unique TTL value.\n\nThe dependency on the storm-hbase project, which is part of Apache Storm, has been removed.  The storm-hbase code could not be enhanced to support a TTL without changing the underlying implementation.  The HBaseMapper interface was altered so that implementation can specify the TTL value for each tuple.\n\nUnit tests have been added to test writes with and without a TTL to HBase.\n\nDepends on the following existing PRs...\n- [x] #246 \n- [x] #251

structures should be supported:\n- An implementation of the `STATS` stellar functions which is backed by an online and mergeable class using distributional sketches for querying distribution.\n- An

METRON-411\n\nPrior to this change the user defines the profile period duration as the number of 'periods per hour'.  For a 15 minute period, the user would define 4 periods per hour.  With this change, the user instead defines the duration of each profile period; '15 minutes' or '4 hours'.\n### Problem\n\nThe current Profiler's deterministic row key design limits the range of profile period durations available to a user.  The original goal was to support 15 minute periods which it does, along with 5, 20, 30 and 60 minute periods.  Different types of profiles and input data will require a range of periods and the Profiler should be flexible in this regard.\n\nCurrently, a profile period must start on each and every hour.  While 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 240 periods per hour is acceptable, 5 periods per hour is not.  The number of periods per hour must be either a multiple or divisor of 60.  Also, a period cannot be any longer than an hour.  In some cases 2, 4, or 8 hour periods might be useful.\n### Solution\n\nThis change uses a much simpler method of calculating row keys and allows the user to set the  specific duration of each profile period.  Based on this duration, each period starting at the epoch, is assigned a monotonically increasing value which is used as part of the row key.

profiler configuration was not being updated from Zookeeper correctly in all cases.  After some period of time the configurations would be updated and the tests would work.  But if this period of time was greater than 90 seconds, the amount of time the profile integration tests wait, then the tests would fail.  \n\nIn all cases, messages were being sent through Storm prior to the bolt actually receiving the profiler configuration, which would cause the `ProfileSplitterBolt` to throw an exception indicating that the configuration could not be found. This message `Fatal: Unable to find valid profiler definition` was a symptom of the problem and occurred much more frequently than the tests actually failed.\n\nSince this issue was intermittent, I cannot be sure it is completely gone, but I have been unable to replicate the problem after these changes.  I also am unable to replicate the `Fatal: Unable to find valid profiler definition` error after this

Stellar compiler is swallowing exceptions thrown during function initialization. The compiler then reports that the function does not exist when in fact the function exists, but initialization failed. The actual error during initialization is lost and not reported anywhere.\n\nFor example, I have a function `PROFILE_GET` that is defined, but is set to fail on initialization.  Prior to this change, an error would be reported that is misleading and hides the actual failure during initialization.\n\n```\norg.apache.metron.common.dsl.ParseException: Unable to find string function PROFILE_GET.

was tested in the following ways:\n## Regression Testing\n- [X] Full Dev - Worked as expected \n- [X] EC2 - Worked as expected\n## Functional Testing\n- [X] Run on docker HDP instance from [docker-ambari](https://github.com/sequenceiq/docker-ambari) Note: used custom (dlyle65535/ambari-agent:2.4.0.0-1130-jdk8 and dlyle65535/ambari-server:2.4.0.0-1130-jdk8)\n## Steps to Stand-Alone Test\n\n**Note:** \nYou'll need docker.py installed and Ansible > 2, we still recommend 2.0.0.2.\nAnsible will error without docker.py installed and give you a chance to:\n\n```\npip install 'docker-py>=1.7.0'\n```\n### Provision Container\n\nStart the container: \n\n```\ndocker run -d --hostname amb-server --privileged --name amb-server -it dlyle65535/ambari-server:2.4.0.0-1130-jdk8\n```\n\nRun a shell on the container: \n\n```\ndocker exec -it amb-server bash\n```\n\nChange nameserver to 8.8.8.8 (change to nameserver 8.8.8.8, delete 2nd line)\n\n```\nvi /etc/resolv.conf\n```\n\nGet HDP repo:\n\n```\nwget -nv http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP/centos7/2.x/updates/2.4.2.0/hdp.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/hdp.repo\n```\n\nInstall Zookeeper:\n\n```\nyum install -y zookeeper-server\n```\n\nSetup and Start Zookeeper:\n\n```\nexport ZOOKEEPER_CONF_DIR=/etc/zookeeper/conf\nexport ZOOKEEPER_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-server\nexport ZOO_LOG_DIR=/var/log/zookeeper\nexport ZOOPIDFILE=/var/run/zookeeper/zookeeper_server.pid\nexport SERVER_JVMFLAGS=-Xmx1024m\nexport JAVA=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\nexport CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$ZOOKEEPER_HOME/*\nexport ZOOCFGDIR=$ZOOKEEPER_CONF_DIR\nexport ZOOCFG=zoo.cfg\nsource $ZOOKEEPER_CONF_DIR/zookeeper-env.sh\n/usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-server/bin/zkServer.sh start\n```\n\nTest Zookeeper:\n\n```\n/usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-server/bin/zkCli.sh -server localhost:2181 ls /\n```\n\nThe command should return:\n\n> Connecting to localhost:2181\n> \n> WATCHER::\n> \n> WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:None path:null\n> [zookeeper]\n\nInstall and Start Kafka:\n\n```\nyum install -y kafka\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka start\n```\n\nTest Kafka:\n\n```\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic test --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test\n```\n\nAdd some test data and hit ctrl-c.\n\n```\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker//bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test --from-beginning\n```\n\nYou should see your test data - ctrl-c to exit.\n\nCreate Probe Data Topics:\n\n```\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic bro --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic snort --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic yaf --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1\n```\n\nExit Container Shell:\n\n```\nexit\n```\n\nInstall Probes using Ansible:\n1. cd <metron-home>/metron-deployment/playbooks\n2. In playbooks/docker_probe_install.yml change kafka_broker_url to  amb-server:9092 (kafka_broker_url: amb-server:9092)\n3. export DOCKER_VERSION=<docker -version> e.g. 1.12.1 (omit any trailing rc stuff)\nansible-playbook docker_probe_install.yml\n4. run ansible-playbook\n\n```\nansible-playbook docker_probe_install.yml\n```\n\nIt should complete with:\n\n> PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************\n> amb-server                 : ok=100  changed=60   unreachable=0    failed=0\n> localhost                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0\n> docker exec -it amb-server bash\n\nStart Sensor Probes:\n\n```\nservice pcap-replay start\n/usr/local/bro/bin/broctl start\nservice yaf start\nservice snortd start\n/usr/hdp/current/flume-server/bin/flume-ng agent -f /etc/flume/conf/flume-snort.conf -n snort > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n```\n\nCheck for

Changes\n- Created a Java API for reading profile data written by the Profiler.  This is contained within a new project `metron-analytics/metron-profiler-client`.\n- Altered the Profiler to use deterministic row keys so that multiple Gets can fetch the data.  This should scale much better at high volumes.\n### Points of Interest\n- `ProfileMeasurement` - Represents a single data point within a Profile.  A Profile is effectively a time series.  To this end a Profile is composed of many ProfileMeasurement values which in aggregate form a time series.  \n- `ProfilePeriod` - The Profiler captures one `ProfileMeasurement` each `ProfilePeriod`.  A `ProfilePeriod` will occur at fixed, deterministic points in time.  This allows for efficient retrieval of profile data.\n- `RowKeyBuilder` - Builds row keys that can be used to read or write profile data to HBase.\n- `ColumnBuilder` - Defines the columns of data stored with a profile measurement.\n- `ProfileHBaseMapper` - Defines for the `HBaseBolt` how profile measurements are stored in HBase.  This class leverages a `RowKeyBuilder` and `ColumnBuilder`.\n### Testing\n\nSpin up a Metron install and write some Profile data to HBase.  Read the profile data using `metron-profiler-client`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-30T00:59:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T15:19:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70d94cd31ef95010e53a24489db17ac26beba18d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/bc192e38a2d80b92bc587f899a90894967e3a4cb","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-389-FINAL","ref":"METRON-389-FINAL","sha":"bc192e38a2d80b92bc587f899a90894967e3a4cb","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

Metron version from 0.2.0BETA to 0.2.1BETA. Covers metron main, metron-analytics, and metron-deployment. Removed old metron-ui references in the rat check. Modified the metron-analytics shell scripts to use ${project.version} instead of hard-coded version.\n\nAddresses - [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-398](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-398)\n\nTested via running builds and will run quick check in full/quick dev imminently.\n\n**Testing**\nRun the following builds in order:\n\n```\n[metron-home]$ mvn clean install\n[metron-home]/metron-deployment$ mvn clean install\n[metron-home]/metron-analytics$ mvn clean install\n```\n\nNote that for metron-deployment you should double check the Docker setup requirements in the [README.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/README.md)\n\nThe builds should all succeed without error, though you will see some warnings in metron-deployment, which is OK.\n","created_at":"2016-08-29T15:50:40Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T20:35:51Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T20:35:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bad88a24a013949285073e5558b15095a7fcd790","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/0dba0f50293420c2d5c417746ff8428972f64a34","head":{"label":"mmiklavc:METRON-398","ref":"METRON-398","sha":"0dba0f50293420c2d5c417746ff8428972f64a34","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58224042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIyNDA0Mg==","name":"metron","full_name":"mmiklavc/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc/metron","description":"Mirror

documentation of the function\n\nInstead, we should create an annotation which will define:\n- function name\n- namespace\n- description\n- List of parameters\n- return documentation\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T17:23:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T20:40:42Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T19:14:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e07006f03de34ec70941a77fadbe697ea324359","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/38bc0da83535936e9ac4632afc07c6463ed96853","head":{"label":"cestella:METRON-396","ref":"METRON-396","sha":"38bc0da83535936e9ac4632afc07c6463ed96853","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

In the previous examples, the current code would throw an index out of bounds exception.\n\nVerified in full-dev-platform.\n\n**Testing:**\n- Deploy the bro parser topology.\n- Add a record to dns.log

[METRON-394](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-394)\n\n[METRON-392](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-392) and #230  Allows a user to optionally define a custom set of 'groupBy' expressions that controls how Profile data is persisted. This is intended to allow for contiguous scans when training on subsets of the data.\n\nA common use case would be grouping the data by some calendar period, like day of week. This would allow a contiguous scan to access all profile data, for example, on Mondays only. The Stellar expression DAY_OF_WEEK(start) would achieve this.\n\nThe following functions have been added for this purpose.\n- WEEK_OF_MONTH\n- WEEK_OF_YEAR\n- DAY_OF_WEEK\n- DAY_OF_MONTH\n- DAY_OF_YEAR\n- MONTH\n-

[METRON-392](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-392)\n\nAllows a user to optionally define a custom set of 'groupBy' expressions that controls how the data is persisted.  This is intended to allow for contiguous scans when training on subsets of the data. \n\nThe 'groupBy' expressions can refer to any field within a `ProfileMeasurement`.  This includes the following fields: \n- `profileName`: The name of the profile.\n- `entity`: The name of the entity being profiled.\n- `start`: The window start time in milliseconds from the epoch.\n- `end`: The window end time in milliseconds from the epoch.\n- `value`: The summary value calculated over the window period.\n- `groupBy`: The set of 'groupBy' expressions; not the result of those expressions.\n\nA common use case would be grouping the data by day of week.  This would allow a contiguous scan to access all profile data for Mondays only.  The Stellar expression `DAY_OF_WEEK(start)` would achieve this. \n\n_NOTE_: A series of date functions will be added to Stellar in a follow-on PR to enhance the types of groups that can be created.\n### Example\n\n```\n{\n  \"inputTopic\": \"indexing\",\n  \"profiles\": [\n    {\n      \"profile\": \"example3\",\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\n      \"onlyif\": \"protocol == 'HTTP'\",\n      \"groupBy\": \"DAY_OF_WEEK(start)\",\n      \"update\": { \"s\": \"STATS_ADD(s, length)\" },\n      \"result\": \"STATS_MEAN(s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Testing\n\nTo test this change do the following. \n- Create a profile and do not define a 'groupBy' expression.  Prior to this change the row key would include the day of week, week of month, etc which altered how the data was sorted on disk.  After this change, these fields will not be included in the row key.\n- Create a profile and define a 'groupBy' expression.  The result of this expression will be embedded in the row key.\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T12:54:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T22:23:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"019706c9e0e1b161e58fdd39a0634526feca2242","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/dbf70431e44e2b47e742de890f9fc648bf6cc07b","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-392","ref":"METRON-392","sha":"dbf70431e44e2b47e742de890f9fc648bf6cc07b","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-377](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-377)\n\nThis pull request replaces #215 .\n\nAs of METRON-372 , Profiles can be built using many statistical summaries that only require a single-pass over the data.  This is less memory intensive and more scalable for high volume loads.\n\nUnfortunately, not all functions can be calculated in a single pass.  In particular, the skewness, ketosis and percentiles require all data to be stored in memory for the calculation to occur.  The platform was enhanced so that a user can leverage skewness, ketosis and percentiles. \n### Changes\n\nThe `STATS_INIT` function was enhanced to accept a `window_size`.  This defines the number of input data elements that are maintained in memory.  \n\nIf the `window_size` is greater than 0, a rolling window of the most recent `window_size` elements is maintained in memory.  The skewness, ketosis and percentiles are calculated over this rolling window.  The `window_size` must be >0 otherwise these values cannot be calculated.\n\nIf a user supplies a `window_size` equal to 0 then the more efficient implementation that does not maintain a rolling window in memory is used.  Of course, in this case, the skewness, ketosis, and percentiles cannot be calculated.\n\nThe following additional functions were also added.\n- STATS_KURTOSIS\n- STATS_SKEWNESS\n- STATS_PERCENTILES\n\nAnother integration test was added to validate this end-to-end also.\n","created_at":"2016-08-23T17:38:55Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T18:47:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a34c06f9e9f6f62c9702d698e985147c47f2b453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/99821cd3feed0cc376bf7858b6e8d1e166626365","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-377-2","ref":"METRON-377-2","sha":"99821cd3feed0cc376bf7858b6e8d1e166626365","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-372](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-372)\n\nThis PR serves as a replacement for #214 .\n### Changes\n\nOnly basic math functions are currently available in Stellar for use with the Profiler.  This makes life difficult for users to create even basic profiles like a running average.  \n\nThis can be seen in the following example where the average must be calculated manually in Stellar.  A variable `sum` and `cnt` must be maintained and then used to calculate the average.\n\n```\n{\n  \"profile\": \"example3\",\n  \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\n  \"onlyif\": \"protocol == 'HTTP'\",\n  \"init\": {\n    \"sum\": 0.0,\n    \"cnt\": 0.0\n  },\n  \"update\": {\n    \"sum\": \"sum + resp_body_len\",\n    \"cnt\": \"cnt + 1\"\n  },\n  \"result\": \"sum / cnt\"\n}\n```\n\nThis change introduces a series of summary functions that make creating profiles much simpler for the user.  Instead of re-implementing the calculation of an average in Stellar, this leverages Commons Math to perform all the heavy lifting.\n\nThe example above for calculating an average can be re-defined as follows.\n\n```\n{\n  \"profile\": \"example3\",\n  \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\n  \"onlyif\": \"protocol == 'HTTP'\",\n  \"init\":   { \"s\": \"STATS_INIT()\" },\n  \"update\": { \"_\": \"STATS_ADD(length, s)\" },\n  \"result\": \"STATS_MEAN(s)\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following summary functions are supported.  These are all statistics that can be calculated in a single pass.  This means that none of the values being summarized are stored in memory.\n- count\n- mean\n- geometric mean\n- max\n- min\n- sum\n- population variance\n- variance\n- second moment\n- quadratic mean\n- standard deviation\n- sum of logs\n- sum of squares.\n","created_at":"2016-08-23T16:53:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T13:32:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03c683bfd2347989e6631c926ae52252fad27eef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/e0cc80e601b09847783e5102393f35b3efc65361","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-372-NEW","ref":"METRON-372-NEW","sha":"e0cc80e601b09847783e5102393f35b3efc65361","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

the PR to get community feedback.\n\nPrereq:\n\nAmbari 2.4\nTesting this PR:\n- Copy or mount the services and stack contents into the appropriate places on the ambari-server node. Afterwards, restart the Ambari server if it is running: `service ambari-server restart`. For example:\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/stacks/HDP/2.4/services/ELASTICSEARCH -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/2.4/services/ELASTICSEARCH\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH\n- ES Master eligible nodes will not contain data. Don't colocate master eligible nodes and data nodes.\n- It's necessary to provide the ES zen_discovery_ping_unicast_hosts.\n\nLimitations / Notes\n- This is based off of Symantec's work at: https://github.com/Symantec/ambari-elasticsearch-service.  Should I add this into the NOTICE that includes similar contributions?\n- Most configs are used from Symantec's build.  If there are more sane configs, we should change the defaults (I'm not an ES expert by any means).\n- It would be really nice if zen_discovery_ping_unicast_hosts could be automatically populated with something sane.  I'm unsure of how to accomplish this with Ambari.\n- Master-eligible nodes are non-data holding nodes that are eligible to be elected master. Data nodes are, not surprisingly, nodes that only hold data, but are not master-eligible. It would be nice if thing could be modified to allow master eligible nodes to also hold data cleanly, but this is left as a further enhancement if needed.\n- A service advisor definition could probably be added to force Ambari to avoid placing master-eligible and data nodes onto the same node.\n","created_at":"2016-08-22T12:59:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T16:48:20Z","closed_at":"2016-08-25T14:42:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8316886bcd6571f1e98e55974321cd06357f10c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/9861d95e45e5c9b3b39fea0722baafd3bb5d0dc1","head":{"label":"justinleet:metron-elasticsearch","ref":"metron-elasticsearch","sha":"9861d95e45e5c9b3b39fea0722baafd3bb5d0dc1","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

this PR for community review and feedback.\n\nPrereq:\n- Ambari 2.4\n\nTesting this PR:\n- The RPMs in metron-deployment should be built.  They should either be mounted or copied to /localrepo in the node to be used as the indexing master node.\n- Copy or mount the services and stack contents into the appropriate places on the ambari-server node.  Afterwards, restart the Ambari server if it is running: `service ambari-server restart`. For example:\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/stacks/HDP/2.4/services/INDEXING -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/2.4/services/INDEXING\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/common-services/INDEXING -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/INDEXING\n- Install the master to a node with the Kafka Broker.\n\nLimitations / Notes\n- Service advisor for ensuring that the service is colocated appropriately doesn't appear to work. It's currently in the PR as-is.  It can easily be removed if we want to leave it out for now.\n- Because the RPMs are currently not published to a yum repo, it's necessary to do the copy / mount step. Assuming the RPMs find a more permanent home, the repolist for the used stack should be updated and preferred.\n- Elasticsearch.properties had a couple properties added to reflect what was in the Ansible scripts, because the current file was missing properties necessary to run the script outside of that context.\n- Ambari currently provides no hooks for performing actions when a service is deleted.  To ensure cleanup please run\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# kafka\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh \\\n        --zookeeper $ZK_QUORUM \\\n        --delete \\\n        --topic

detailed instructions for testing are coming soon, but I wanted to get community eyes on this asap.\n\nThis PR addresses [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-383](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-383)\n\nTo test this PR:\n- You need to build the rpm's and make them available in a \"/localrepo\" directory on the node you plan to use as Master for the parsers.\n- Copy or mount the services and stacks content into the correct ambari-server resources directories. For example\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/stacks/HDP/2.3/services/PARSERS -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/2.3/services/PARSERS\n  - incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/src/main/resources/common-services/PARSERS -> /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/common-services/PARSERS\n- Use Ambari 2.4\n- Install on a node with a Kafka Broker and ZK client (service advisor recommendations to come in a separate PR)\n- You can check both a full install as well as an install of HDFS, Kakfa, Zookeeper, and Storm followed after by Metron Parsers.\n\nCleanup/delete service\n- delete the service via Ambari UI or REST API\n  Run the following commands from the master node, swapping out the zookeeper quorum as appropriate:\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# kafka\n# (in your kafka settings, first enable delete.topic.enable=true and restart Kafka)\nfor topic in bro parser_error parser_invalid snort yaf\ndo\n    /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh \\\n            --zookeeper amb1.service.consul:2181,amb2.service.consul:2181,amb3.service.consul:2181 \\\n            --delete \\\n            --topic $topic\ndone\n\n# storm kill\nfor i in bro yaf snort\ndo\n    storm kill $i\ndone\n\n# yum delete\nyum -y erase metron-parsers metron-common\n\n# final file delete\nrm -rf /usr/metron\n\n# zookeeper\n/usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-client/bin/zkCli.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181\n\n# once connected to the client do this:\nrmr /metron\n```\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T21:46:38Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T19:17:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T19:17:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"691d43d9cad80a0a85718d209b440291d07248bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/7d19b4b1066f68a2151be7790747938f6dfd01fa","head":{"label":"mmiklavc:METRON-383","ref":"METRON-383","sha":"7d19b4b1066f68a2151be7790747938f6dfd01fa","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58224042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIyNDA0Mg==","name":"metron","full_name":"mmiklavc/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc/metron","description":"Mirror

This change depends on #208, #212, #213, #214 . The diff will be easier to grok once those PRs are merged.\n### [METRON-377](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-377)\n\nAs of METRON-372 and #214 , Profiles can be built using many statistical summaries that only require a single-pass over the data.  This is less memory intensive and more scalable for high volume loads.\n\nUnfortunately, not all functions can be calculated in a single pass.  In particular, the skewness, ketosis and percentiles require all data to be stored in memory for the calculation to occur.  The platform was enhanced so that a user can leverage skewness, ketosis and percentiles. \n### Changes\n\nThe `STATS_INIT` function was enhanced to accept a `window_size`.  This defines the number of input data elements that are maintained in memory.  \n\nIf the `window_size` is greater than 0, a rolling window of the most recent `window_size` elements is maintained in memory.  The skewness, ketosis and percentiles are calculated over this rolling window.  The `window_size` must be >0 otherwise these values cannot be calculated.\n\nIf a user supplies a `window_size` equal to 0 then the more efficient implementation that does not maintain a rolling window in memory is used.  Of course, in this case, the skewness, ketosis, and percentiles cannot be calculated.\n\nThe following additional functions were also added.\n- STATS_KURTOSIS\n- STATS_SKEWNESS\n- STATS_PERCENTILES\n\nAnother integration test was added to validate this end-to-end also.\n","created_at":"2016-08-17T20:20:32Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-23T17:39:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf0eea0143f4435e00932a7cd59c7cc7de279f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/62a3a0f48d5c792c85486014cfa45e2c4620362c","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-377","ref":"METRON-377","sha":"62a3a0f48d5c792c85486014cfa45e2c4620362c","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-372](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-372)\n\nNote: This change depends on #208, #212, & #213.  The diff will be easier to grok once those PRs are merged.\n### Changes\n\nOnly basic math functions are currently available in Stellar for use with the Profiler.  This makes life difficult for users to create even basic profiles like a running average.  \n\nThis can be seen in the following example where the average must be calculated manually in Stellar.  A variable `sum` and `cnt` must be maintained and then used to calculate the average.\n\n```\n{\n  \"profile\": \"example3\",\n  \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\n  \"onlyif\": \"protocol == 'HTTP'\",\n  \"init\": {\n    \"sum\": 0.0,\n    \"cnt\": 0.0\n  },\n  \"update\": {\n    \"sum\": \"sum + resp_body_len\",\n    \"cnt\": \"cnt + 1\"\n  },\n  \"result\": \"sum / cnt\"\n}\n```\n\nThis change introduces a series of summary functions that make creating profiles much simpler for the user.  Instead of re-implementing the calculation of an average in Stellar, this leverages Commons Math to perform all the heavy lifting.\n\nThe example above for calculating an average can be re-defined as follows.\n\n```\n{\n  \"profile\": \"example3\",\n  \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\n  \"onlyif\": \"protocol == 'HTTP'\",\n  \"init\":   { \"s\": \"STATS_INIT(0)\" },\n  \"update\": { \"_\": \"STATS_ADD(length, s)\" },\n  \"result\": \"STATS_MEAN(s)\"\n}\n```\n\nThe following summary functions are supported.  These are all statistics that can be calculated in a single pass.  This means that none of the values being summarized are stored in memory.\n- count\n- mean\n- geometric mean\n- max\n- min\n- sum\n- population variance\n- variance\n- second moment\n- quadratic mean\n- standard deviation\n- sum of logs\n- sum of squares.\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T20:32:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-23T16:53:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed8d7fca18670dc9ddb62e43cad54e22abe2f0f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/660dedc0cce672535f52d9ab650d899621b249c8","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-372","ref":"METRON-372","sha":"660dedc0cce672535f52d9ab650d899621b249c8","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-309](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-309)\n\nCreated a normalcy profiler, otherwise known as the Metron Profiler.   \n\nThe Profiler is a feature extraction mechanism that can generate a profile describing the behavior of an entity on a network. An entity might be a server, user, subnet or application. Once a profile has been generated defining what normal behavior looks-like, it can be used to build models that identify anomalous behavior.\n\nThis is achieved by summarizing the streaming telemetry data consumed by Metron over sliding windows. A summary statistic is applied to the data received within a given window. Collecting this summary across many windows results in a time series that is useful for analysis.\n### Changes\n\nThis PR contains the following high-level changes to Metron.\n- A Storm topology that generates Profiles. `metron-analytics/metron-profiler`\n- Changes to Ansible to deploy the Profiler topology. `metron-deployment` \n- A new bolt and associated tooling to perform HBase writes from a Storm topology. `metron-platform/metron-hbase`\n- Additions to the Stellar language to provide arithmetic and control flow logic required to generate Profiles. `metron-platform/metron-common`\n### Testing\n\nFollow the instructions contained in the [README](https://github.com/nickwallen/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-309/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#getting-started) to get your very first Profile running.\n### Documentation\n- Documentation for the Profiler is contained within the [README](https://github.com/nickwallen/incubator-metron/blob/METRON-309/metron-analytics/metron-profiler/README.md).\n- The code itself contains plenty of comments and Javadocs.  \n- The design document is attached to the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-309).\n","created_at":"2016-08-10T23:48:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:32Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T14:48:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ee4befc70efebc5b8f2b3b909cdffcc563b0000","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/78d2c66d8ba6d6555fa03021775a60839010ed6b","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-309","ref":"METRON-309","sha":"78d2c66d8ba6d6555fa03021775a60839010ed6b","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

is a Yarn application and associated utilities which is intended to allow users the ability to deploy REST endpoints (presumably to serve up data science models).\n\nIn order to test this, I would recommend the following:\n- Deploy Metron on vagrant via the `quickdev`\n- From monit @ `http://node1:2812` stop the following to ensure enough headroom (this is overkill, btw)\n  - `yaf`\n  - `snort`\n  - `pcap-service`\n  - `pcap-replay`\n  - All of the parser topologies\n  - The enrichment topology\n  - The indexing topology\n- ssh into node1 as root\n- From node1\n  - Create a directory `~/dummy`\n  - Copy the [following](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cestella/incubator-metron/METRON-339-1/metron-analytics/metron-maas-service/src/test/resources/maas/dummy_rest.sh) into the directory `~/dummy` as `dummy.sh`\n  - Change directories to `/usr/metron/0.2.0BETA`\n  - Start the `MaaS` service via `bin/maas_service.sh -zq node1:2181`\n  - Start one instance of the dummy echo service (named `dummy` version `1.0` in a container of 500m via `bin/maas_deploy.sh -lmp ~/dummy -hmp /user/root/maas/dummy -m 500 -mo ADD -n dummy -ni 1 -v 1.0 -zq node1:2181`\n  - Wait a couple seconds and ensure that it started by running `curl -i http://localhost:1500/echo/foobar` and ensuring you get `foobar` in return\n  - List the active models via `bin/maas_deploy.sh -mo LIST -n dummy -zq node1:2181` and ensure that you see the `dummy` model show up in the output\n  - Remove one instance of the dummy model via `bin/maas_deploy.sh -mo REMOVE -n dummy -ni 1 -v 1.0 -zq node1:2181`\n  - After a couple seconds ensure that you cannot access the dummy model any longer via `curl -i

additional files to the classpath instead of modifying Metron jar file internals to include items required on the classpath.\n\nI successfully tested this on full dev platform.\n\nAdditional info - [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-54](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-54)\n\n**Testing**\n\nStandard deployment that includes deployment via Ambari. Ensure that the pipeline runs without Exceptions from the parsers through to indexing in Elasticsearch. Verify you see indexes being populated in Kibana. Note: If you're seeing exceptions in the full dev platform in Vagrant, you might need to stop YARN, MR2, and any other processes not necessary to verify indexing works

PR includes multiple sub-tasks as well.\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-214\n\nMETRON-299 Build Parsers Deployment RPM\nMETRON-300 Build Enrichment Deployment RPM\nMETRON-301 Build Elasticsearch Deployment RPM\nMETRON-302 Build Common Deployment RPM\nMETRON-303 Build Dataloads Deployment RPM\nMETRON-304 Build PCAP Deployment RPM\nMETRON-305 Build Solr Deployment RPM\n\n**Instructions for Testing**\n- Run the metron build from incubutor-metron (project root)\n\n`mvn clean install`\n- Copy the build artifacts to the rpm SOURCES directory\n\n`cd incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker && ./copysources.sh`\n- Install Docker on your host machine - [Docker Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)\n- Run Docker image and mount the rpm-docker directory\n\n`docker run -d -P --name rpm-docker -v <absolute-path>/incubator-metron/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker:/root/rpmbuild -it dlyle65535/rpm-docker`\n- ...If you need to re-run this for any reason, you can delete the docker instance by running\n\n`docker rm rpm-docker`\n- Login to the container\n\n`docker exec -it rpm-docker /bin/bash`\n- Execute the rpm build - this cleans the rpm dirs, runs the build, and executes verification via rpmlint. Verify no Exceptions occur during the build, and that rpmlint also completes without exceptions (you'll see some warnings, but these are OK)\n\n```\ncd rpmbuild\n./build.sh\n```\n- Install the rpm packages\n\n`for i in rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/*.rpm; do rpm -ivh $i; done`\n- Check the installation - verify expected files appear in the metron install directory\n\n`find /usr/metron`\n- Uninstall and verify all files removed\n\n`for i in $(rpm -qa|grep metron); do rpm -e $i; done`\n- `/usr/metron` should no longer
