[fonttools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) from 4.39.3 to 4.43.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/releases\">fonttools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>4.43.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[subset] Set up lxml <code>XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)</code> when parsing OT-SVG documents to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks (9f61271dc): <a href=\"https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python/py-xxe/\">https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python/py-xxe/</a></li>\n<li>[varLib.iup] Added workaround for a Cython bug in <code>iup_delta_optimize</code> that was leading to IUP tolerance being incorrectly initialised, resulting in sub-optimal deltas (60126435d, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cython/cython/issues/5732\">cython/cython#5732</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib] Added new command-line entry point <code>fonttools varLib.avar</code> to add an <code>avar</code> table to an existing VF from axes mappings in a .designspace file (0a3360e52).</li>\n<li>[instancer] Fixed bug whereby no longer used variation regions were not correctly pruned after VarData optimization (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3268\">#3268</a>).</li>\n<li>Added support for Python 3.12 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3283\">#3283</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.42.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[t1Lib] Fixed several Type 1 issues (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3238\">#3238</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3240\">#3240</a>).</li>\n<li>[otBase/packer] Allow sharing tables reached by different offset sizes (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3241\">#3241</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3236\">#3236</a>, 457f11c2).</li>\n<li>[varLib/merger] Fix Cursive attachment merging error when all anchors are NULL (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3248\">#3248</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3247\">#3247</a>).</li>\n<li>[ttLib] Fixed warning when calling <code>addMultilingualName</code> and <code>ttFont</code> parameter was not passed on to <code>findMultilingualName</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3253\">#3253</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.42.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[varLib] Use sentinel value 0xFFFF to mark a glyph advance in hmtx/vmtx as non participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation purposes other than {H,V}VAR (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3235\">#3235</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus not participating in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3234\">#3234</a>).</li>\n<li>Added varLib.avarPlanner script to deduce 'correct' avar v1 axis mappings based on glyph average weights (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3223\">#3223</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.41.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[subset] Fixed perf regression in v4.41.0 by making <code>NameRecordVisitor</code> only visit tables that do contain nameID references (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3213\">#3213</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3214\">#3214</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib.instancer] Support instancing fonts containing null ConditionSet offsets in FeatureVariationRecords (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3211\">#3211</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3212\">#3212</a>).</li>\n<li>[statisticsPen] Report font glyph-average weight/width and font-wide slant.</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Fixed head.created date incorrectly set to 0 instead of the current timestamp, regression introduced in v4.40.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3210\">#3210</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib.merger] Support sparse <code>CursivePos</code> masters (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3209\">#3209</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.41.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Fixed bug in setupOS2 with default panose attribute incorrectly being set to a dict instead of a Panose object (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3201\">#3201</a>).</li>\n<li>[name] Added method to <code>removeUnusedNameRecords</code> in the user range (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3185\">#3185</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib.instancer] Fixed issue with L4 instancing (moving default) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3179\">#3179</a>).</li>\n<li>[cffLib] Use latin1 so we can roundtrip non-ASCII in {Full,Font,Family}Name (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3202\">#3202</a>).</li>\n<li>[designspaceLib] Mark <!-- raw HTML omitted --> as optional in docs (as it is in the code).</li>\n<li>[glyf-1] Fixed drawPoints() bug whereby last cubic segment becomes quadratic (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3189\">#3189</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3190\">#3190</a>).</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Propagate the 'hidden' flag to the fvar Axis instance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3184\">#3184</a>).</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Update setupAvar() to also support avar 2, fixing <code>_add_avar()</code> call site (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3183\">#3183</a>).</li>\n<li>Added new <code>voltLib.voltToFea</code> submodule (originally Tiro Typeworks' &quot;Volto&quot;) for converting VOLT OpenType Layout sources to FEA format (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3164\">#3164</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.40.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this.

a bug that caused undefined relax variables in the output of `CanonicalizeBindings` for cases where `VisitVarDef(const Var&)` replaces a variable, and `VisitExpr_(const VarNode*)` returns a value with different struct info, both occurring within the same `VarBinding`.\r\n\r\nThe ExprMutator is only allowed to update a variable's struct info if the value bound to it has new struct info.  When CanonicalizeBindings replaces a trivial binding, this may provide better struct info as a result.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, `ExprMutator::ReEmitBinding` defined a remap for `binding->var->vid`, even if the derived class defined a replacement by overriding `VisitVarDef`.  If the derived class defines a new variable binding by overriding `VisitVarDef`, and also causes a variable replacement by overriding `VisitExpr` and returning a type with different struct info, then `ExprMutator` must check for both `binding->var->vid` *AND* `new_var->vid`.  The former may be present in the unmodified graph, and the latter may be produced by the derived class before delegating to the base class.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `ExprMutator::ReEmitBinding` to define entries for both replacements that may be

TensorIR scheduling, the `IterVar`s that represent environment threads may duplicate, i.e. it is legal to have two env threads with the same name tag, which may fail the `SingleEnvThreadVerifier` check during schedule creation. This PR disables this check in this case. In the future, it may be worthwhile to bring it back against post-scheduling TIR.\r\n\r\nIt's related to [this commit](https://github.com/apache/tvm/commit/eb15d04c3bff76062e26d5647fb8af0323de1bed).

conversion from tensorflow to MSC is done by first converting from tensorflow to relay, then converting from relay to executable python code, executing that python code to generate relax, and finally converting from relax to MSC.  During the relax phase of this conversion, some relax `IRModule` are applied, including `FuseOpsByPattern`.\r\n\r\nThe test cases in `test_msc/test_translate_tensorflow.py` rely on `FuseOpsByPattern` preserving trivial bindings (e.g. `var_1 = var_2`) in the relax IRModule.  If these trivial bindings are removed by `CanonicalizeBindings`, then the test cases in this file fail.  The presence or absence of trivial bindings `FuseOpsByPattern` should be considered an implementation detail, and relax passes should not be required to preserve trivial bindings.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the relay to executable python step of the tensorflow to MSC conversion, to remove trivial bindings and output a variable name that matches the expected value in the test case.  While not an ideal resolution, as other variable name changes could still reintroduce the same test failures, it ensures that `FuseOpsByPattern` may canonicalize bindings as an internal pre- or post-processing step without breaking these unit tests.","created_at":"2024-01-04T22:17:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T14:25:18Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T04:42:21Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T04:42:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"b69d720593d68a2869b1afb673d53896ca190ecd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0682cc74043f61d819fac54b254c09af15773fad","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_msc_avoid_depending_on_trivial_bindings_in_test","ref":"unity_msc_avoid_depending_on_trivial_bindings_in_test","sha":"0682cc74043f61d819fac54b254c09af15773fad","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

C++ standard requires two-phase name resolution for templates.  By default, MSVC uses a non-standard name resolution, in which all names are looked up when a template is instantiated.  This has caused MSVC-specific compilation errors ([example](https://github.com/apache/tvm/actions/runs/7400684492/job/20134841480?pr=16183)), which are quite difficult to debug.\r\n\r\nThis commit

proposed a pass `storage_rewrite` and provided a trivial storage reuse plan based on liveness analysis, just as #9341 mentioned, the solution has some limitations:\r\n1. storage_rewrite can't handle buffer with different dtypes. \r\n    ```c++\r\n    int8 A_shared[32];\r\n    int8 B_shared[32];\r\n    int32 C_shared[4]; // will not be reused even we have enough workspace as different types. \r\n    ```\r\n2. storage_rewrite can't allocate a buffer in the place of another 2 buffers.\r\n     ```c++\r\n        int8 A_shared[32];\r\n        int8 B_shared[32];\r\n        int8 C_shared[64]; \r\n       // will be reused as A_shared[32], B_shared[64],  results in 32 half elements space waste.\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n#8571 and #9341 introduced a pass `MergeDynamicSharedMemoryAllocations`, which can support efficient memory reuse solely for dynamic shared memory. However, sometimes we do not want to use dynamic shared memory for codegen, so this pull request made a simple extend to `MergeDynamicSharedMemoryAllocations` to support both dynamic and static shared memory optimal reuse.\r\n\r\nBy default, the static shared memory merge is disabled to maintain consistency, to enable the static part:\r\n```python\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(config={\"tir.merge_static_smem\": True}):\r\n    cuda_mod = tvm.build(sch.mod, target=\"cuda\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake int8xint8=int32 tensorcore gemm as an example, we have a big tile and used static shared memory, before the pass:\r\n```cpp\r\n__global__ void __launch_bounds__(128) Fused(int8_t* __restrict__ input0, int8_t* __restrict__ input1, int* __restrict__ output0) {\r\n  \r\n  int mediate0_shared_warp[128];\r\n  __shared__ signed char input0_shared[16384];\r\n  __shared__ signed char input1_shared[16384];\r\n  signed char input0_shared_warp[64];\r\n  signed char input1_shared_warp[64];\r\n  signed char input0_shared_warp_1[64];\r\n  signed char input1_shared_warp_1[64];\r\n  __shared__ int mediate0_shared[6400];\r\n``` \r\n\r\nit will exceed the maximum available static shared memory, and compilation will fail. After this pass \r\n```cpp\r\n__global__ void __launch_bounds__(128) Fused(int8_t* __restrict__ input0, int8_t* __restrict__ input1, int* __restrict__ output0) {\r\n  \r\n  __shared__ uchar buf_shmem[32768];\r\n  int mediate0_shared_warp[128];\r\n  signed char input0_shared_warp[64];\r\n  signed char input1_shared_warp[64];\r\n  signed char input0_shared_warp_1[64];\r\n  signed char input1_shared_warp_1[64];\r\n```\r\nwe can save around 50% shared memory and the compilation can pass, code generation perf with [fastdlight](https://github.com/LeiWang1999/tvm/blob/dev/fast_dlight/python/tvm/dlight) can achieve 510+Tflops (without the pass, the best tile is around 420TFlops on A100), this pass will enable us to explore more tile configs under static shared memory.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the pass can optimize the dynamic shared memory plan as well, as the storage_rewrite pass will merge C_shared to B_shared in this example, which is not friendly for further memory plan analysis, the flag `merge_static_smem` will disable the trivial reuse behavior by (don't know if the flag can be improved):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif (!enable_reuse || is_small_array || !is_flat_memory_space) {\r\n  return NewAlloc(op, attach_scope, scope, const_nbits);\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2024-01-03T17:14:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-05T21:58:56Z","closed_at":"2024-01-05T19:15:27Z","merged_at":"2024-01-05T19:15:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3216a6972d0d990b28c9177bf2d82a93989a360","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a9ca5a86f04c26c19b1d62108f931e3cd2086faf","head":{"label":"LeiWang1999:dev/merge_static_shared","ref":"dev/merge_static_shared","sha":"a9ca5a86f04c26c19b1d62108f931e3cd2086faf","user":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":615660601,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLI8OQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"LeiWang1999/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999/tvm","description":"Open

`test_pass_fq2i_avg_pool2d.py::test_avgpool_conv2d` test is sensitive to rounding errors, and failed about a third of the time (42 / 100 tests).  This was first noticed as CI failures in unrelated PRs (e.g. https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm-hexagon/detail/PR-16184/6/tests). This commit marks the flaky portions of the test with `pytest.mark.xfail`, to avoid causing breaking CI for other PRs.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the extent of the disabled test cases, this commit breaks up each of the unit tests.  Where previously a single test performed both hardware/simulation tests and relay graph comparisons, these are now done in separate test functions.  The hardware/simulation tests use `tvm.testing.assert_allclose` and have a tolerance of `1e-02`, while the graph-comparison tests use `tvm.ir.structural_equal`, and require identical floating-point values.  Only the graph-comparison test is disabled here.\r\n\r\nThe other two test cases in `test_pass_fq2i_avg_pool2d.py` do not show this same sensitivity, with no failures seen in 100

to this PR, the memory planning for different Relax functions are not independent -- storage tokens are shared across different Relax functions.\r\n\r\nThis will incur memory overuse sometimes. For example, tensor `A` in `func1` has 128 bytes, tensor `B` in `func2` has 2048 bytes. If the memory planning decides to share the storage token for `A` and `B`, the shared token will have size 2048 bytes.\r\n\r\nConsider the case when at runtime only `func1` is executed, and `func2` is never invoked. In this case, only 128 bytes for tensor `A` is needed, while a total 2048-chunk is allocated in total, which is a 16x memory overuse.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the memory planning across different Relax function independent. That means in the example above, when only `func1` is executed, only 128 bytes will be allocated.","created_at":"2023-12-30T21:04:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T18:10:02Z","closed_at":"2023-12-31T18:10:02Z","merged_at":"2023-12-31T18:10:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f7e0d578f777a630bb6e4a79d9c2ec52b7be461","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

an optimizations should be performed may depend on when the variables in an expression are known.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider a LoRA-adjusted model, with base weights `W` of shape `[m,n]`, LoRA components `A` and `B` with shapes `[r,n]` and `[m,r]` respectively, and activations `x` with shape `[n,1]`.  The LoRA-adjusted matmul could be computed either as `(W + B*A)*x` or as `(W*x + B*(A*x))`.\r\n\r\nIf `A` and `B` are provided at run-time, then computing `(W + B*(A*x))` requires significantly fewer computations.\r\n\r\n* `(W + B*A)*x`: `m*n*(2*r + 3)` operations\r\n  1. `B*A`: `2*m*n*r` operations using a naive matmul\r\n  2.

Multiplying `x` by (2): `2*m*n` operations\r\n\r\n* `(W*x + B*(A*x))`: (2*m*n + r*(2*n + 2*m + 1))\r\n  1. `W*x`: `2*m*n` operations\r\n  2. `A*x`: `2*r*n` operations\r\n  3. Multiplying `B` by (2): `2*m*r` operations\r\n  4. Adding (1) and (3)`: `m` operations\r\n\r\nHowever, if `A` and `B` are known at compile-time, then computing `(W\r\n+ B*A)*x` groups all compile-time values together, allowing them to be computed earlier (i.e. using `LiftTransformParams`)\r\n\r\n* `(W + B*A)*x`: `2*m*n` operations\r\n  1. `B*A`: 0 operations, computed at compile-time\r\n  2.

Multiplying `x` by (2): `2*m*n` operations\r\n\r\nSince the choice of optimized expression depends on which parameters can be computed at compile-time, it is useful to have a utility that identifies values that can be computed at compile-time.","created_at":"2023-12-29T21:20:30Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T18:06:52Z","closed_at":"2024-01-04T18:06:49Z","merged_at":"2024-01-04T18:06:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3aa71a53e507ebe5caa283c0c2aee643d69e561","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/04e72047b6fd67811661d3086f10d590e7e6fd31","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_analysis_collect_compile_time_bindings","ref":"unity_analysis_collect_compile_time_bindings","sha":"04e72047b6fd67811661d3086f10d590e7e6fd31","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `BundleModelParams` would replace model parameters with `param_tuple[index]` within expressions.  These nested expressions would then be normalized, resulting in `gv = param_tuple[index]` or `lv = param_tuple[index]` variable definitions.  These auto-generated `gv` and `lv` names make it quite difficult to determine which model parameter is being used.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `BundleModelParams` transform to explicitly produce the bound variable, `orig_param_name = param_tuple[index]`, preserving human-readable names from the parameters.","created_at":"2023-12-29T19:08:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T22:06:13Z","closed_at":"2024-01-08T22:06:10Z","merged_at":"2024-01-08T22:06:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"fab6db20e730edaa15f9b91e66336f3a01e381ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7414392cfb08ce56088f1df761f1edf4b943289f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_keep_parameter_name_when_bundling","ref":"unity_keep_parameter_name_when_bundling","sha":"7414392cfb08ce56088f1df761f1edf4b943289f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

updates to the cutlass kernels made in TVM PR #16244 require symbols provided in cuda 7.5+.  While the cuda architecture is specified by setting `NVCC_FLAGS` in the `CMakeLists.txt` for each kernel, cmake 3.18+ also sets it based on the\r\n`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` value.  If not set, cmake will explicitly pass the compute capability as nvidia's default of 5.2, *EVEN IF* it has already been specified in `NVCC_FLAGS`.  Because the kernels cannot compile with compute capability of 5.2, this causes compilation errors.\r\n\r\nBy setting `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to `OFF`, cmake does not add 5.2 as a target architecture.\r\n\r\nSee https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0104.html for details on CMake's policy for CUDA architecture flags.\r\n\r\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/a/28933055 for the default CUDA architecture for each version of CUDA.","created_at":"2023-12-29T17:52:07Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T17:07:37Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T21:26:47Z","merged_at":"2024-01-02T21:26:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"163c7ac43610c958b481e6f39ed97bcc309f8af9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d82694fa85884f5e7c04cab5a6727e5142874837","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_cmake_compatibility_fix","ref":"unity_cmake_compatibility_fix","sha":"d82694fa85884f5e7c04cab5a6727e5142874837","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR allows dynamic shape in some modules of `nn.Module` (Linear and Embedding), motivated by dynamic vocab size as discussed in https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/pull/1417.\r\n\r\n**UX-wise**\r\nWe allow `nn.Parameter(\"vocab_size\", 4096)`, equivalent to `nn.Parameter(tir.Var(\"vocab_size\", \"int64\"), 4096)`.\r\n\r\n**Symbolic relationship across Parameters**\r\nWe make sure the same symbolic shape for different `nn.Parameter` do not appear twice within the same method. For instance, the following **_would not happen_**:\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef prefill(...):\r\n  vocab_size = T.int64()   # for `embed_tokens`\r\n  vocab_size1 = T.int64()  # for `lm_head`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is prevented by `str2var_params` in `Exporter`, so that all `embed_tokens.shape[0]` and `lm_head.shape[0]` share the same `tir.Var`.\r\n\r\n**Symbolic vars shared across functions**\r\nWe also prevent two relax.Function sharing the same tir.Var for a symbolic shape, e.g. TIR variable A and B share the same physical address in memory below.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def prefill(...):\r\n    vocab_size = T.int64() <== A\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def decode(...):\r\n    vocab_size = T.int64() <== B\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe prevent this by reinitializing `params = _params()` and the mapping before each call to `_emit_method()`, so that the `packed_params` is different for each function.","created_at":"2023-12-27T15:30:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T19:44:01Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T19:44:01Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T19:44:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"07d8e0236791e5d9069f2b4f9227bc33f77b328b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c4b01678123b1455d88280b7049a3ec89a79a4df","head":{"label":"CharlieFRuan:pr-1226-symbolic-shape-param","ref":"pr-1226-symbolic-shape-param","sha":"c4b01678123b1455d88280b7049a3ec89a79a4df","user":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717204711,"node_id":"R_kgDOKr-s5w","name":"tvm","full_name":"CharlieFRuan/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan/tvm","description":"Open

Add distiller, enable knowledge distilliation.\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 3 will be split into some steps:\r\nM3.1 Add distiller for distill model\r\nM3.2 **Add gym for pruning and quantization, enable auto prune/quantize**\r\n\r\nGym in MSC works like auto tvm in tvm. It extract tasks from tools and search the best policy for apply pruning/quantization. The design of gym is similar with OpenAI Gym: https://github.com/openai/gym. It defines the optimization process as \"envs\" and search methods as \"agents\".

PR refactors the previous PagedAttentionKVCache, and provides a common attention KV cache interface `src/runtime/relax_vm/kv_cache.h` for efficient K/V data management and attention computation.\r\n\r\nThe refactored PagedKVCache supports common prefix caching: if two sequences have a shared prefix (e.g., a system prompt, or a context document), we can first add the prefix into KV cache, and then fork the two child sequences from the prefix, and add their respective exclusive parts to KV cache. In such case, the KV data of the shared prefix is computed only once, and can be reused for multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for the refactored PagedKVCache `tests/python/relax/test_runtime_builtin_paged_attention_kv_cache.py`. The tests at this moment depends on FlashInfer\r\n(https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer)\r\nfor efficient attention computation. Given the CI does not build TVM with FlashInfer enabled, the tests are marked as skipped right now. Tests are passed in my local development environment.\r\n\r\nThere are remaining works on the PagedKVCache implementation. Right now FlashInfer does not support on-the-fly RoPE application when computing attention in common prefix scenario. Therefore, we fallback to adopt a dedicated RoPE kernel to apply RoPE prior to appending K/V data into the cache. This blocks some applications such as sliding window attention. We will work on this with followup improvements to PagedKVCache in the future.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Zihao Ye <expye@outlook.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ruihang Lai

Summary\r\nThis PR fixes a logical bug in your code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhile triaging your project, our bug fixing tool generated the following message(s)-\r\n> In file: [pytorch.py](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L599), method: `tensor_split`, a logical equality check operation was performed. The operands are such that the comparison operation always returns either true or false. Such logical short circuits in code lead to unintended behavior. iCR suggested that the logical operation should be reviewed for correctness.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution / Suggested Changes\r\nIn the `tensor_split` method, there's a comparsion that checks if the input tensor is zero-dimensional or one-dimensional long tensor. In the comparsion, there's a typo that converts the shape of the tensor to a list and compares against integer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nRunning an example code like below gives us the following result-\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# Create a one-dimensional tensor\r\ntensor_0d = torch.tensor(43)\r\ntensor_1d = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\r\n\r\n# Print the tensor and its shape\r\nprint(tensor_0d)\r\nprint(tensor_1d)\r\n\r\nprint(\"Tensor Shape:\", tensor_0d.shape)\r\nprint(\"Tensor Shape:\", tensor_1d.shape)\r\n\r\nprint(\"Tensor Shape List:\", list(tensor_0d.shape))\r\nprint(\"Tensor Shape List:\", list(tensor_1d.shape))\r\n\r\nprint(\"Tensor Len:\", len(tensor_0d.shape))\r\nprint(\"Tensor Len:\", len(tensor_1d.shape))\r\n```\r\n```\r\ntensor(43)\r\ntensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\r\nTensor Shape: torch.Size([])\r\nTensor Shape: torch.Size([5])\r\nTensor Shape List: []\r\nTensor Shape List: [5]\r\nTensor Len: 0\r\nTensor Len: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## CLA Requirements\r\n*This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.*\r\n\r\nAll contributed commits are already automatically signed off.\r\n\r\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\r\n>\r\n> \\- [Git Commit SignOff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sponsorship and Support\r\nThis work is done by the security researchers from OpenRefactory and is supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/): [Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/). Alpha-Omega is a project partnering with open source software project maintainers to systematically find new, as-yet-undiscovered vulnerabilities in open source code - and get them fixed – to improve

Add distiller, enable knowledge distilliation.\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 3 will be split into some steps:\r\nM3.1 Add distiller for distill model\r\nM3.2 Add gym for pruning and quantization, enable auto prune/quantize\r\n\r\nDistillation is common used method for model pruning and quantization. It optimize a student model and distill it with teacher model. Runner build the teacher model via disabling MSC tools while build student model via enabling the tools. The distiller then bind teacher and student together and controls the learning process.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy
