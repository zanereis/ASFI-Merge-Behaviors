If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for target encoding of ml features.\r\nTarget Encoding maps a column of categorical indices into a numerical feature derived from the target.\r\nLeveraging the relationship between categorical variables and the target variable, target encoding usually performs better than one-hot encoding (while avoiding the need to add extra columns)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTarget Encoding is a well-known encoding technique for categorical features.\r\nIt's supported on most ml frameworks\r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.TargetEncoder.html\r\nhttps://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/dataPreparation/html/target_encode.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nSpark API now includes 2 new classes in package org.apache.spark.ml\r\n- TargetEncoder (estimator)\r\n- TargetEncoderModel (transformer)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nScala => org.apache.spark.ml.feature.TargetEncoderSuite\r\nJava =>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `(Ssl)CoarseGrainedExecutorBackendSuite` to reduce test resource and increase timeout in order to reduce the flakiness in the resource hungry GitHub Action environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test case of `(Ssl)CoarseGrainedExecutorBackendSuite` injects a faulty plugin to check the executor restart. Sometime, it fails due to the timeout during restarting the executors.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11168954174/job/31048566907\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-40320 Executor should exit when initialization failed for fatal error *** FAILED ***\r\n  The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 187 times over 15.001016415999999 seconds.\r\n  Last failure message: 1 was not greater than or equal to 2.\r\n (CoarseGrainedExecutorBackendSuite.scala:602)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn k8s currently the executor failure tracking is done in the `ExecutorPodsAllocator` class which calculates with the failed PODs (where POD state is `PodFailed`) but `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` can remove those pods when \"spark.kubernetes.executor.deleteOnTermination\" is switched on.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced easily by making the executor always fail and check the executor IDs known by `ExecutorFailureTracker` by adding some new logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n24-09-25 20:29:51 WARN ExecutorPodsAllocator: all failed: Set(69, 5, 10, 56, 37, 52, 20, 46, 78, 74, 70, 21, 33, 53, 77, 73, 32, 34, 45, 22, 71, 54, 49, 76, 91, 66, 35, 48, 18, 50, 67, 11, 72, 55, 75, 36, 51, 19, 47, 68, 90)\r\n24-09-25 20:29:51 ERROR ExecutorPodsAllocator: Max number of executor failures (40) reached       \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see 40 was the limit but the \"all failed\" set does not contain the first 40 consecutive executor IDs but there are huge gaps (even executor ID 91 is contained).\r\n\r\nSo my idea is to remove this race between `ExecutorPodsAllocator` and `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` to move the executor failure tracking logic into `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo keep the maximum number of failed executors limit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBoth with manual testing and unit testing. \r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n```\r\n24-09-26 05:54:03 WARN ExecutorPodsAllocator: 2 new failed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProvide more user facing error when ordinal of the column is out of bounds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere's an issue where `GetColumnByOrdinal` can return attributes which length doesn't match ordinal which is used as a parameter. When that happens we throw an assertion error which is not user friendly. Because of that we introduced new QueryExecutionError in order to make it more user facing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, error message is more user friendly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-10-03T15:53:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T16:49:35Z","closed_at":"2024-10-04T16:49:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f9ac4f03c23e8a94112b917e48e0a7a212c30da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce50b3acc51793012225a94e2cec6f208c50c2e8","head":{"label":"mihailoale-db:mihailoale-db/fixgetcolumnordinaloutofboundserrormessage","ref":"mihailoale-db/fixgetcolumnordinaloutofboundserrormessage","sha":"ce50b3acc51793012225a94e2cec6f208c50c2e8","user":{"login":"mihailoale-db","id":171580095,"node_id":"U_kgDOCjoavw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171580095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailoale-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":813567139,"node_id":"R_kgDOMH4Mow","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailoale-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailoale-db","id":171580095,"node_id":"U_kgDOCjoavw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/171580095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailoale-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailoale-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailoale-db/spark","description":"Apache

issue where partition column sometimes doesn't match any from the table schema. When that happens we throw an assertion error which is not user friendly. Because of that we introduced new `QueryExecutionError` in order to make it more user facing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users will get more user friendly

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen there is any predicate missing in getPartitionsbyFilter and it tries to fetch all the partitions, the request is broken into smaller chunks as:\r\n1. Retrieve the names of all partitions using getPartitionNames\r\n2. Divide the partition names list into smaller batches.\r\n3. Fetch the partitions using their names with function getPartitionsByNames.\r\n4. If the fetching fails, it reduces the batch size by 2 and looks for lesser number of partitions till the maxRetries hit\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change is to address the issue of heavy load on HMS, when there are huge number of partitions(~600,000), the metadata size exceeds the 2Gb limit on the thrift server buffer size. Hence we get socket time out and HMS crashes with OOM as well. Tried to replicate same behaviour as [HIVE-27505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-27505) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\nTo enable batching they should be using parameters as:\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.batchSize = 1000 , by default it is disabled\r\nspark.sql.metastore.partition.batch.retry.count = 3\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested in local environment with following performance \r\nWith batch size = 1\r\n24/09/28 18:11:21 INFO

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Fixes a bug in `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` to respect the `nullable` attribute of nested expressions when normalizing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Without the fix, there would be a degradation in the nullability of the expression post normalization.\r\n- For example, for an expression like: `namedStruct(\"struct\", namedStruct(\"double\", <DoubleType-field>)) ` with the following data type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStructType(StructField(\"struct\", StructType(StructField(\"double\", DoubleType, true, {})), false, {}))\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter normalizing we would have ended up with the dataType:\r\n```\r\nStructType(StructField(\"struct\", StructType(StructField(\"double\", DoubleType, true, {})), true, {})) \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, the change in the `nullable` attribute of the \"double\" StructField from `false` to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Added unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change wraps the iterator returned by `SQLExecutionRDD#compute` so that it propagates the SQL conf at the time the iterator is actually used. This ensures that the SQL conf is propagated when actions are called on the RDD stored in `Dataset#rdd`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, this PR fixes `SparkPlan#executeToIterator` so that the returned iterator will propagate the SQL conf at the time the iterator is actually used. This ensures that the SQL conf is propagated when `next` or `hasNext` is called on the iterator returned by `Dataset#toLocalIterator`.\r\n\r\nNote three things:\r\n\r\n* `Dataset#rdd` is a val, not a method, so the `SQLExecutionRDD` instance is created only once per dataset.\r\n* The `SQLExecutionRDD` constructor takes a snapshot of the driver-side SQL conf (this code already exists in `SQLExecutionRDD`). This PR simply ensures that the existing snapshot is pushed to the executors when actions are called on the `SQLExecutionRDD` instance (or its children).\r\n* Because the `SQLExecutionRDD` instance is created only once and keeps a snapshot of the SQL conf, it does not pick up changes to the SQL conf after `Dataset#rdd` is referenced.\r\n\r\nBecause of the above limitation, this PR also changed a single test in both `CSVSuite` and `JsonSuite`. These two tests create a single dataset and then change config between calls to `checkAnswer`. It turns out that `QueryTest` will reflect back exceptions only from `Dataset#rdd#count` (it captures and converts exceptions from `Dataset.collect` into assert failures). Since the two modified tests expect exceptions after certain config changes, and those config changes are not picked up by the cached `SQLExecutionRDD` instance, I changed the test to create a new dataset between calls to `checkAnswer`.\r\n\r\nThose two tests worked in the past only because `QueryTest` wrapped the call to `Dataset#rdd#count` with `SQLExecution.withSQLConfPropagated`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`SQLExecutionRDD#compute` currently propagates the SQL conf to the executors when obtaining and returning the iterator. However, that iterator is not actually used until after the SQL conf on the executor has been reset to its old state. Therefore, when the job actually runs, the executors have the wrong SQL conf.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `Dataset#toLocalIterator` returns an iterator that doesn't even attempt to propagate the SQL conf.\r\n\r\nThis results in data correctness issues. E.g.:\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\"{'data': {'a': [19], 'b': 123456}}\").toDF(\"str\").cache()\r\nval df: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = [str: string]\r\n\r\nscala> val query = df.selectExpr(\"from_json(str, 'data struct<a: int, b: int>')\")\r\nval query: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [from_json(str): struct<data: struct<a: int, b: int>>]\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"set spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults=false\")\r\nval res0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [key: string, value: string]\r\n\r\nscala> query.collect()(0)\r\nval res1: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [[null]]          <----- correct result\r\n\r\nscala> query.rdd.collect()(0)\r\nval res2: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [[[null,123456]]] <----- incorrect result!\r\n\r\nscala> query.toLocalIterator.next()\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nval res3: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [[[null,123456]]] <----- incorrect result!\r\n\r\nscala> \r\n```\r\nThis PR attempts to fix the above, with the caveat that the RDD stored in `Dataset#rdd`, once created, will not pick up changes to the SQL conf.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when running `Dataset.localCheckpoint(eager = true)`, it is impossible to specify a non-default StorageLevel for the checkpoint. On the other hand it is possible with Dataset cache by using `Dataset.persist(newLevel: StorageLevel)`.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to specify a non-default StorageLevel for localCheckpoint, it currently needs accessing the plan, changing the level, and then triggering an action to materialize checkpoint:\r\n```\r\n// start lazy\r\nval checkpointDf = df.localCheckpoint(eager = false)\r\n// fish out the RDD\r\nval checkpointPlan = checkpointedSourcePlanDF.queryExecution.analyzed\r\nval rdd = checkpointedPlan.asInstanceOf[LogicalRDD].rdd\r\n// change the StorageLevel\r\nrdd.persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)\r\n// force materialization\r\ncheckpointDf\r\n    .mapPartitions(_ => Iterator.empty.asInstanceOf[Iterator[Row]])\r\n    .foreach((_: Row) => ())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are several issues with this:\r\n1. Won't work with Connect as we don't have access to RDD internals\r\n2. Lazy checkpoint is not in fact lazy when AQE is involved. In order to get the RDD of a lazy checkpoint, AQE will actually trigger execution of all the query stages except the result stage in order to get the final plan. So the `start lazy` phase will already execute everything except the final stage, and then `force materialization` will only execute result stage. This is \"unexpected\" and makes it more difficult to debug, first showing a query with missing metrics for the final stage, and then another query that skipped everything and only ran final stage.\r\n\r\nHaving an API to specify storageLevel for localCheckpoint will help avoid such hacks. As a precedent, it is already possible to specify StorageLevel for Dataset cache by using `Dataset.persist(newLevel: StorageLevel)`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I implement this API for scala and python, and classic and connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/commands/merge/MergeIntoMaterializeSource.scala in `prepareMergeSource` has to do hacks as described above to use localCheckpoint with non-default StorageLevel. It is hacky, and confusing that it then records two separate executions as described above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nAdds API to pass `storageLevel` to Dataset `localCheckpoint`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: Github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, support for LOOP statement in SQL scripting is introduced.\r\n\r\nChanges summary:\r\n\r\nGrammar/parser changes:\r\n- `loopStatement` grammar rule\r\n- `visitLoopStatement` rule visitor\r\n- `LoopStatement` logical operator\r\n\r\n`LoopStatementExec` execution node\r\nIterator implementation - repeatedly execute body (only way to stop the loop is with LEAVE, or if an exception occurs)\r\n`SqlScriptingInterpreter` - added logic to transform LoopStatement logical operator to LoopStatementExec execution node\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of SQL Scripting introduced to Spark, LOOP statement is a basic control flow construct in the SQL language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests are introduced to scripting test suites: `SqlScriptingParserSuite`, `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` and `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to refactor the `compileExpression` of `JdbcDialect` so that simplify the subclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent definition of `compileExpression` works with the `JDBCSQLBuilder`. The JDBC dialect should override the `compileExpression` with almost identical code if JDBC dialect want supports special SQL syntax.\r\nThis PR adds the function `jdbcSQLBuilder(): JDBCSQLBuilder`, so that the subclass could reuse the code come from parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDataFrameReader has 3 APIs for JSON reading\r\n\r\njson(DataSet[String])\r\njson(Rdd)\r\njson(filePath)\r\n\r\nFirst two APIs respects provided user schema nullability when spark flag `spark.sql.legacy.respectNullabilityInTextDatasetConversion` is set to true, but third one does not respect and provided schema nullability is always overriden to true.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n`dataFrameReader.json(jsonRDD)` and `dataFrameReader.json(jsonDataSet)` will check mentioned config, but `dataFrameReader.json(path)` will hit totally different code path, and it will end up in `FileTable` where `dataSchema` getter will override fields nullability to true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome users just want to have a validation of data and to get exception when some field is nullable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen customer set newly added Spark conf `spark.sql.respectUserSchemaNullabilityForFileDataSourceWithFilePath`, provided user schema nullability will not be overriden to true anymore.\r\nDefault value for flag is false.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUsing integration test in base JsonSuite class.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-02T09:32:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-18T00:22:47Z","closed_at":"2025-01-18T00:22:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40b715d29435c5179fe7eb8eb7013d646182e95d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f64be00f285b6c826dc9e47ba7b2b2acb0dfb922","head":{"label":"urosstan-db:Respect-user-schema-nullability-file-connectors","ref":"Respect-user-schema-nullability-file-connectors","sha":"f64be00f285b6c826dc9e47ba7b2b2acb0dfb922","user":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":750788282,"node_id":"R_kgDOLMAeug","name":"spark","full_name":"urosstan-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a proper clone mechanism for ArtifactManager during a Spark Session cloning. The cloned manager will have a fresh copy of all the parent's resources.\r\n\r\nDuring a clone, cached relations, classes, JARs, and Python artifacts are copied to the new instance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR cloning a Spark session won't take parents' artefacts to the cloned session.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-02T08:13:49Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T09:01:39Z","closed_at":"2024-10-24T01:22:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"326b5548596492f21924ff6610bb275f141222f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d203404b97d2aae3c68f23369e891f20ff147e0","head":{"label":"xupefei:clone-artifact-manager","ref":"clone-artifact-manager","sha":"0d203404b97d2aae3c68f23369e891f20ff147e0","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `appArgs` and `environmentVariables` fields optional in REST API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`appArgs` and `environmentVariables` became mandatory due to the Apache Mesos limitation at Spark 2.2.2. Technically, this is a revert of SPARK-22574.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19966\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 4.0 removed Mesos support, we don't need these requirements.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43135\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because this is a relaxation of enforcement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the revised test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix the issue in `AlterTableChangeColumnCommand` where changing the comment of a char/varchar column also tries to change the column type to string. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBecause the newColumn will always be a `StringType` even when the metadata says that it was originally char/varchar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the query will no longer fail when using this code path.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew query in golden files.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the correctness issue about losing operators during analysis - it happens when window is provided to window()/session_window() function.\r\n\r\nThe rule `TimeWindowing` and `SessionWindowing` are responsible to resolve the time window functions. When the window function has `window` as parameter (time column) (in other words, building time window from time window), the rule wraps window with WindowTime function so that the rule ResolveWindowTime will further resolve this. (And TimeWindowing/SessionWindowing will resolve this again against the result of ResolveWindowTime.)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the rule uses \"return\" for the above, which intends to have \"early return\" as the other branch is too long compared to this branch. This unfortunately does not work as intended - the intention is just to go out of current local scope (mostly end of curly brace), but it seems to break the loop of execution in \"outer\" side.\r\n(I haven't debugged further but it's simply clear that it doesn't work as intended.)\r\n\r\nQuoting from Scala doc:\r\n\r\n> Nonlocal returns are implemented by throwing and catching scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnException-s.\r\n\r\nIt's not super clear where NonLocalReturnException is caught in the call stack; it might exit the execution for much broader scope (context) than expected. And it's finally deprecated in Scala 3.2 and likely be removed in future.\r\n\r\nhttps://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/dropped-features/nonlocal-returns.html\r\n\r\nInterestingly it does not break every query for chained time window aggregations. Spark already has several tests with DataFrame API and they haven't failed. The reproducer in community report is using SQL statement - where each aggregation is considered as subquery.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the rule to NOT use early return and instead have a huge if else.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribed in above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this fixes the possible query breakage. The impacted workloads may not be very huge as chained time window aggregations is an advanced usage, and it does not break every query for the usage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-01T03:19:13Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T22:38:52Z","closed_at":"2024-10-04T22:38:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1def81e799c520aba6ca5149b43112142d634591","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8d23bc6af3f9a725f15df27d5eddcb91d968bab","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-49836","ref":"SPARK-49836","sha":"f8d23bc6af3f9a725f15df27d5eddcb91d968bab","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Cherry-pick of the original PR - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48190 to Spark 3.5\r\n\r\n- When pruning the schema of the struct in `GetArrayStructFields`, rely on the existing `StructType` to obtain the pruned schema instead of using the accessed field.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug in `OptimizeCsvJsonExprs` rule that would have otherwise changed the schema fields of the underlying struct to be extracted.\r\n- This would show up as a correctness issue where for a field instead of picking the right values we would have ended up giving null output.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The query output would change for the queries of the following type:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  from_json('[{\"a\": '||id||', \"b\": '|| (2*id) ||'}]', 'array<struct<a: INT, b: INT>>').a,\r\n  from_json('[{\"a\": '||id||', \"b\": '|| (2*id) ||'}]', 'array<struct<a: INT, b: INT>>').A\r\nFROM\r\n  range(3) as t\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier, the result would had been:\r\n```\r\nArray([ArraySeq(0),ArraySeq(null)], [ArraySeq(1),ArraySeq(null)], [ArraySeq(2),ArraySeq(null)])\r\n```\r\nvs the new result is (verified through spark-shell):\r\n```\r\nArray([ArraySeq(0),ArraySeq(0)], [ArraySeq(1),ArraySeq(1)], [ArraySeq(2),ArraySeq(2)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit tests.\r\n- Without this change, the added test would fail as we would have modified the schema from `a` to `A`:\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-49743: prune unnecessary columns from GetArrayStructFields does not change schema *** FAILED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to skip PySpark `test_cast_to_udt_with_udt`test during `SPARK_SKIP_CONNECT_COMPAT_TESTS` in branch-3.5.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark 4.0.0's PySpark Connect compatibility test fails.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_python_connect35.yml\r\n\r\nThis is due to the newly added feature. Although this is a kind of Apache Spark 4.0.0 test suite, we need to disable this test case from `branch-3.5`.\r\n- #48251 \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a test-only PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis should be tested after merging via Daily CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake ColumnNodeToExpressionConverter ExpressionColumnNode into DeveloperApis instead of internal so that external advanced developers can write columns with codegen that take in columns for input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the ColumNode interface external advanced developers building codegen expressions wishing to provide a Scala API have to hack around and access internal Spark APIs. This is illustrated in my PR upgrading spark-testing-base's codegen example to Spark 4 preview2 -- see https://github.com/holdenk/spark-testing-base/pull/423\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo -- developer only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAnnotation/visibility only change, verified (manually) that these APIs would be sufficient in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe change involves pushing the concrete class obtained from parameterized type variable and any introspected type variables in the concrete class's hierarchy, in the mappings so that encoder can be created.\r\nTo further illustrate\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Foo[T] {\r\n  private var myT: T\r\n}\r\nclass InnerWrapper[U] {\r\n  private var myFoo: Foo[U]\r\n}\r\nclass OuterWrapper extends InnerWrapper[String]\r\n\r\n```\r\nWith this change, an instance of OuterWrapper has the String type pushed through to myFoo.myT, and the correct encoder is generated.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue tracked by bug [SPARK-46679](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46679)\r\nSo that appropriate encoder can be created.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded bug tests and additional tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\nBut the original fix was created by @squito  and I verified it using extra testing.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-30T21:28:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T20:48:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e6bac684976da49989510bbb048361ebca5b2e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab9789c9b1c6b25e3e23069c8840b1595bc49c8b","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-46679","ref":"SPARK-46679","sha":"ab9789c9b1c6b25e3e23069c8840b1595bc49c8b","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for skipping shuffles for ORDER BY or other sort operations, if on partition columns.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis could potentially optimize many jobs, where today all data is shuffled even if we have all the partition values and can sort them.  This is a common scenario, for example Iceberg often requests data to be sorted by partition before write , to avoid small file issue.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n No\r\n\r\n  ### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n Add test in KeyGroupedPartitioningSuite\r\n\r\n ### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\n  No\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-30T20:46:33Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T06:02:01Z","closed_at":"2024-12-15T05:16:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39d81b4dd767b60ed6d761e827cb6fac04562d58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48303/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48303/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48303/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7de08934df49583331e26a6d30acbbd08b0a7dc8","head":{"label":"szehon-ho:SPARK-49839","ref":"SPARK-49839","sha":"7de08934df49583331e26a6d30acbbd08b0a7dc8","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647563706,"node_id":"R_kgDOJpkJug","name":"spark","full_name":"szehon-ho/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this pull request, the proposed changes include introducing tests for the **NULLIF** function. These tests will help prevent potential regressions by ensuring that future modifications do not unintentionally break the behavior of **NULLIF**. I have written several tests, along with queries that combine NULLIF with GROUP BY to cover more complex use cases.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is a lack of tests for the NULLIF function. We should add tests to prevent regressions.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-30T15:40:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T06:59:24Z","closed_at":"2024-10-03T06:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7053aab93b21059ab1de7f901b032e89e5e9022c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5cafd2ec131adfa3dfb9d0775974f476a0a2b09a","head":{"label":"ivanjevtic-db:nullif-tests","ref":"nullif-tests","sha":"5cafd2ec131adfa3dfb9d0775974f476a0a2b09a","user":{"login":"ivanjevtic-db","id":180169423,"node_id":"U_kgDOCr0qzw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180169423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanjevtic-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":854454165,"node_id":"R_kgDOMu3vlQ","name":"spark","full_name":"ivanjevtic-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ivanjevtic-db","id":180169423,"node_id":"U_kgDOCr0qzw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/180169423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanjevtic-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanjevtic-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ivanjevtic-db/spark","description":"Apache

Let's look at the minimal repro:\r\n```\r\n      sql(\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n          |WITH\r\n          |t1 AS (SELECT 1 col),\r\n          |t2 AS (SELECT * FROM t1)\r\n          |SELECT * FROM t2\r\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin).createTempView(\"v\")\r\n      // r1 is un-referenced, but it should not decrease the ref count of t2 inside view v.\r\n      val df = sql(\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n          |WITH\r\n          |r1 AS (SELECT * FROM v),\r\n          |r2 AS (SELECT * FROM v)\r\n          |SELECT * FROM r2\r\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\nThe logical plan is something like below\r\n```\r\nWithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r1\r\n    View v\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2    // main query of the inner WithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r2\r\n    View v   // exactly the same as the view v above\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2\r\n  CTERef r2    // main query of the outer WithCTE\r\n```\r\nIdeally, the ref count of `t1`, `t2` and `r2` should be all `1`. They will be inlined and the final plan is the `OneRowRelation`. However, in `InlineCTE#buildCTEMap`, when we traverse into `CTEDef r1` and hit `CTERef t2`, we mistakenly update the out-going-ref-count of `r1`, which means that `r1` references `t2` and this is totally wrong. Later on, in `InlineCTE#cleanCTEMap`, we find that `r1` is not referenced at all, so we decrease the ref count of its out-going-ref, which is `t2`, and the ref count of `t2` becomes `0`. Finally, in `InlineCTE#inlineCTE`, we leave the plan of `t2` unchanged because its ref count is `0`, and the plan of `t2` contains `CTERef t1`. `t2` is still inlined so we end up with `CTERef t1` as the final plan without the `WithCTE` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently for on-demand PVCs we cannot add user-defined annotations, user-defined annotations can greatly help to add tags in underlying storage.\r\nFor e.g. if we add `k8s-pvc-tagger/tags` annotation & provide a map like {\"env\":\"dev\"}, the same tags are reflected on underlying storage (for e.g. AWS EBS) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are needed so users can set custom annotations to PVCs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt does not break any existing behaviour but adds a new feature/improvement to enable custom annotations additions to ondemand PVCs\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis was tested in internal/production k8 cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-30T07:57:04Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T21:26:07Z","closed_at":"2024-09-30T21:26:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84ee9e36d63d85008b876531398b9399efbd8a7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48299/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48299/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48299/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad793e8ba2a76d7d419f41237f6db93284e8e804","head":{"label":"prathit06:ondemand-pvc-annotations","ref":"ondemand-pvc-annotations","sha":"ad793e8ba2a76d7d419f41237f6db93284e8e804","user":{"login":"prathit06","id":53890994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODkwOTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53890994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06","html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":855833464,"node_id":"R_kgDOMwL7eA","name":"spark","full_name":"prathit06/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prathit06","id":53890994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODkwOTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53890994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06","html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06/spark","description":"Apache

I'm not sure about the coverage of this optimization, but there are two major issues with the above optimization: \r\n\r\n1) missing to add the input to state store in left side prevents the input on the right side to match with \"that\" input. Even though the input is going to be evicted in this batch, there could be still inputs on the right side in this batch which can match with that input.\r\n\r\n2) missing to add the input to state store prevents that input to produce unmatched (null-outer) output, as we produce unmatched output during the eviction of state.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that `state watermark != watermark for eviction` and eviction we mentioned in above is based on \"state watermark\". state watermark could be either 1) equal or earlier than watermark for eviction or 2) \"later\" than watermark for eviction.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, there are correctness issues among stream-stream join, especially when the output of the stateful operator is provided as input of stream-stream join. The correctness issue is fixed with the PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-30T02:49:13Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T03:15:46Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T02:03:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a9fcf42438357ba0a89719023df89f8a0c38842","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen there is any predicate missing in getPartitionsbyFilter and it tries to fetch all the partitions, the request is broken into smaller chunks as:\r\n1. Retrieve the names of all partitions using getPartitionNames\r\n2. Divide the partition names list into smaller batches.\r\n3. Fetch the partitions using their names with function getPartitionsByNames.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change is to address the issue of heavy load on HMS, when there are huge number of partitions(~600,000), the metadata size exceeds the 2Gb limit on the thrift server buffer size. Hence we get socket time out and HMS crashes with OOM as well. Tried to replicate same behaviour as [HIVE-27505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-27505) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\nTo enable batching they should be using parameters as:\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.batchSize = 1000 , by default it is disabled\r\nspark.sql.metastore.partition.batch.retry.count = 3\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAvoid flush during shutdown in rocksdb close path\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, we see sometimes that `cancelAllBackgroundWork` gets hung if there are memtables that need to be flushed. We also don't need to flush in this path, because we only assume that sync flush is required in the commit path.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tat app//org.rocksdb.RocksDB.cancelAllBackgroundWork(Native

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a merged backport of SPARK-46525 with the original authorship, @yaooqinn .\r\n- #44509\r\n- #44612\r\n- #45303\r\n\r\n`com.spotify.docker.client` is not going to support Apple Silicons as it has already been archived and the [jnr-unixsocket](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.jnr/jnr-unixsocket) 0.18 it uses is not compatible with Apple Silicons.\r\n\r\nIf we run our docker IT tests on Apple Silicons, it will fail like\r\n\r\n```java\r\n[info] org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite *** ABORTED *** (2 seconds, 264 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   com.spotify.docker.client.exceptions.DockerException:

needed?\r\n\r\nFor developers who use Apple Silicons, w/ this patch, they can test JDBC/Docker Integration test locally instead of suffering slowness from GitHub actions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and do the manual test on Apple Silicon.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChoose a proper name for the error conditions _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_3055 and _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_3146 defined in core/src/main/resources/error/error-conditions.json. The name should be short but complete (look at the example in error-conditions.json).\r\n\r\nAdd a test which triggers the error from user code if such test still doesn't exist. Check exception fields by using checkError(). The last function checks valuable error fields only, and avoids dependencies from error text message. In this way, tech editors can modify error format in error-conditions.json, and don't worry of Spark's internal tests. Migrate other tests that might trigger the error onto checkError().\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis changes needed because spark 4 introduce new approach with user friendly error messages. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if user's code depends on error condition names.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-27T20:14:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T06:59:29Z","closed_at":"2024-10-10T06:59:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16b7bbe36be7d6a225bc19051bca89706c4f7cb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc1d202b4c73dd9fd7686a58c1b8e7b640d5adb2","head":{"label":"mrk-andreev:SPARK-49549","ref":"SPARK-49549","sha":"bc1d202b4c73dd9fd7686a58c1b8e7b640d5adb2","user":{"login":"mrk-andreev","id":669347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/669347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev","html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":484998266,"node_id":"R_kgDOHOh8eg","name":"spark","full_name":"mrk-andreev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mrk-andreev","id":669347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/669347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev","html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrk-andreev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mrk-andreev/spark","description":"Apache

Let's look at the minimal repro:\r\n```\r\n      sql(\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n          |WITH\r\n          |t1 AS (SELECT 1 col),\r\n          |t2 AS (SELECT * FROM t1)\r\n          |SELECT * FROM t2\r\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin).createTempView(\"v\")\r\n      // r1 is un-referenced, but it should not decrease the ref count of t2 inside view v.\r\n      val df = sql(\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n          |WITH\r\n          |r1 AS (SELECT * FROM v),\r\n          |r2 AS (SELECT * FROM v)\r\n          |SELECT * FROM r2\r\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\nThe logical plan is something like below\r\n```\r\nWithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r1\r\n    View v\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2    // main query of the inner WithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r2\r\n    View v   // exactly the same as the view v above\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2\r\n  CTERef r2    // main query of the outer WithCTE\r\n```\r\nIdeally, the ref count of `t1`, `t2` and `r2` should be all `1`. They will be inlined and the final plan is the `OneRowRelation`. However, in `InlineCTE#buildCTEMap`, when we traverse into `CTEDef r1` and hit `CTERef t2`, we mistakenly update the out-going-ref-count of `r1`, which means that `r1` references `t2` and this is totally wrong. Later on, in `InlineCTE#cleanCTEMap`, we find that `r1` is not referenced at all, so we decrease the ref count of its out-going-ref, which is `t2`, and the ref count of `t2` becomes `0`. Finally, in `InlineCTE#inlineCTE`, we leave the plan of `t2` unchanged because its ref count is `0`, and the plan of `t2` contains `CTERef t1`. `t2` is still inlined so we end up with `CTERef t1` as the final plan without the `WithCTE` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to show the spark version of the connect server when Spark Connect Client starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the gradual popularize of Spark Connect module, when the Spark Connect client starts, explicitly displaying the spark version of the `connect server`, will reduce confusion for users during execution, such as the new version having some features. However, if it connects to an old version and encounters some problems, it will have to manually troubleshoot.\r\n<img width=\"878\" alt=\"image\"

the `Spark version` on the `server side` when starting the client, reducing confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually check.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-27T11:35:47Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T07:25:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-28T07:25:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63bad8fe892f60f6da913c3ee988471a38eaa4ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49f723541bdc6dcb60836de86eb175dcea684509","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-49814","ref":"SPARK-49814","sha":"49f723541bdc6dcb60836de86eb175dcea684509","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add `byte-buddy` dependency for modules that depend on `mockito-core` to ensure `sbt test` uses the correct `byte-buddy`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo ensure that `sbt test` can use the correct version of `byte-buddy`, I have only observed this issue when using `sbt test` with Java 21. This issue has not been observed when using `sbt test` with Java 17(Perhaps it just didn't print the Warning Message) or `maven test` with Java 17/21(Maven can confirm that there is no such issue).\r\n\r\nJava 21 sbt daily test:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11099131939/job/30881044324\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: A Java agent has been loaded dynamically (/home/runner/.cache/coursier/v1/https/maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/net/bytebuddy/byte-buddy-agent/1.14.15/byte-buddy-agent-1.14.15.jar)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11099131939/job/30881045891\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: A Java agent has been loaded dynamically (/home/runner/.cache/coursier/v1/https/maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/net/bytebuddy/byte-buddy-agent/1.14.15/byte-buddy-agent-1.14.15.jar)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11099131939/job/30881047740\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: A Java agent has been loaded dynamically (/home/runner/.cache/coursier/v1/https/maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/net/bytebuddy/byte-buddy-agent/1.14.15/byte-buddy-agent-1.14.15.jar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that `byte-buddy-agent-1.14.15.jar` is being used in the sbt tests with Java 21, but the version defined in the `dependencyManagement` of the parent `pom.xml` is `1.14.17`:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3093ad68d2a3c6bab9c1605381d27e700766be22/pom.xml#L1221-L1231\r\n\r\nInconsistent dependency versions pose potential risks, such as the possibility that maven tests may pass while sbt tests may fail. Therefore, we should correct it.Meanwhile, for consistency, I have added a test dependency on `byte-buddy` for all modules that depend on `mockito-core`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual inspection shows that `sbt test` with Java 21 is using version 1.14.17 of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use `sbt.IO` in `SparkBuild.scala` to avoid naming conflicts with `java.io.IO` in Java 23, and after this PR, Spark can be built using sbt with Java 23(current pr does not focus on the results of `sbt/test` with Java 23)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake Spark be compiled using sbt with Java 23.\r\n\r\nBecause Java 23 has added `java.io.IO`, and `SparkBuild.scala` imports both `java.io._` and `sbt._`, this results in the following error when executing\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-3 -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pdocker-integration-tests -Pyarn -Pvolcano -Pkubernetes -Pkinesis-asl -Phive -Phadoop-cloud Test/package streaming-kinesis-asl-assembly/assembly connect/assembly\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith Java 23\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-3 -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pdocker-integration-tests -Pyarn -Pvolcano -Pkubernetes -Pkinesis-asl -Phive

is set.\r\n[info] welcome to sbt 1.9.3 (Azul Systems, Inc.

change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual check: \r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-3 -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl

this pr, the aforementioned command can be executed successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-27T08:34:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T16:12:09Z","closed_at":"2024-09-27T15:51:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8c277abd981d4e657392ada036d0c25489123c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bea5013bc5188f06166f89f35fa63dcb5ed25462","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:build-with-java23","ref":"build-with-java23","sha":"bea5013bc5188f06166f89f35fa63dcb5ed25462","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

`outputOrdering`, it top-down traverse the tree, and requires the lock of `QueryPlan.canonicalized` in the path. \r\nIn this deadlock, it successfully obtained the lock of `WholeStageCodegenExec` and requires the lock of `HashAggregateExec`;\r\n\r\nConcurrently, a subquery execution thread is performing code generation and bottom-up traverses the tree via `def consume`, which checks `WholeStageCodegenExec.usedInputs` and refererences a lazy val `QueryPlan.references`. It requires the lock of `QueryPlan.references` in the path.\r\nIn this deadlock, it successfully obtained the lock of `HashAggregateExec` and requires the lock of `WholeStageCodegenExec`;\r\n\r\nThis is due to Scala's lazy val internally calls this.synchronized on the instance that contains the val.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen deploying Spark pods on Kubernetes with sidecars, the reported executor's exit code may be incorrect.\r\nFor example, the reported executor's exit code is 0(success), but the actual is 52 (OOM).\r\n```\r\n2024-09-25 02:35:29,383 ERROR TaskSchedulerImpl.logExecutorLoss - Lost executor 1 on XXXXX: The executor with\r\n id 1 exited with exit code 0(success).\r\n  \r\nThe API gave the following container statuses:\r\n \r\n     container name: fluentd\r\n     container image: docker-images-release.XXXXX.com/XXXXX/fluentd:XXXXX\r\n     container state: terminated\r\n     container started at: 2024-09-25T02:32:17Z\r\n     container finished at: 2024-09-25T02:34:52Z\r\n     exit code: 0\r\n     termination reason: Completed\r\n

`ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager.findExitCode()` looks for any terminated container and may choose the sidecar instead of the main executor container. I'm changing it to look for the executor container always. \r\nNote, it may happen that the pod fails because of the failure of the sidecar container while executor's container is still running, with my changes the reported exit code will be -1 (`UNKNOWN_EXIT_CODE`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo correctly report executor failure reason on UI, in the logs and for the event listeners `SparkListener.onExecutorRemoved()`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the executor's exit code is taken from the main container instead of the sidecar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test and tested manually on the Kubernetes cluster by simulating different types of executor failure (JVM OOM and container eviction due to disk pressure on the node).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the JOIN operator.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW join_test_t1\r\n  AS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1) AS grouping(a);\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW join_test_empty_table\r\n  AS SELECT a FROM join_test_t1 WHERE FALSE;\r\n\r\nTABLE join_test_t1\r\n|> FULL OUTER JOIN join_test_empty_table\r\n   ON (join_test_t1.a = join_test_empty_table.a);\r\n\r\n1\tNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-26T20:46:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T03:21:57Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T03:21:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c18b0db02c7fe59988cd8f0c50c85a8f8329c8d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8ba2228f357b441a416a2bfc68cd153570a547e","head":{"label":"dtenedor:pipe-join","ref":"pipe-join","sha":"e8ba2228f357b441a416a2bfc68cd153570a547e","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

It gets even more confusing if multiple collations are not supported for some functions. \r\nInstead of this naming convention should be only specifiers that are supported and avoid using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe existing documentation of `RuntimeConfig.get()` is misleading:\r\n * `get(key: String)` method will not throw any exception if the key is not set as long as the config entry has a default value, instead, it will just return the `defaultValue` of the `ConfigEntry`. An `NoSuchElementException` will only be thrown if there is no default value for the config entry.\r\n * `get(key: String, default: String)` method will ignore the `defaultValue` of its `ConfigEntry`, and return the given param `default` if unset. \r\n * `getOption(key: String)` method will return the `defaultValue` of its `ConfigEntry` if the config is not set, instead of `None`.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn example to demonstrate the behaviour:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"501\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18650646-1920-4967-b2eb-fa4f21f2ca6c\">\r\n\r\nThe first line makes sure the config is not set.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.unset(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\") \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code returns `Etc/UTC`, which doesn't throw any exception.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\") \r\nres1: String = \"Etc/UTC\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code returns `Some(\"Etc/UTC\")`, instead of `None`.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.getOption(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\") \r\nres2: Option[String] = Some(value = \"Etc/UTC\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following code returns `Europe/Berlin`, ignoring the default value. However, the documentation only says it returns the value, without mentioning ignoring the default value of the entry when the config is not explicitly set.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"Europe/Berlin\") \r\nres3: String = \"Europe/Berlin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the documentation is fixed and a new test case is added.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe incorrect documentation is likely to mislead users to weird behaviours if they rely on the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case in `RuntimeConfigSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix the expression `ArrayContains` bug where `value` is `null`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Give an example with the following code:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t(data array<int>, value int) USING PARQUET\")\r\nsql(\"INSERT INTO TABLE t VALUES (array(1, 2, 3, null), null)\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\nsql(\"SELECT array_contains(data, value) FROM T\").show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n```scala\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n|data           |value|\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n|[1, 2, 3, NULL]|NULL |\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n|array_contains(data, value)|\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n|NULL                       |\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note: Obviously, the result of `array_contains(data, value)` does not meet common sense expectations.**\r\n\r\n- After\r\n```scala\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n|data           |value|\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n|[1, 2, 3, NULL]|NULL |\r\n+---------------+-----+\r\n\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n|array_contains(data, value)|\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n|true                       |\r\n+---------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, corrected incorrect results about `ArrayContains`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Add new UT & update UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-26T06:04:45Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T00:24:56Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T00:24:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f6f52c253c7bec3d60f712f598cca000718b1ee","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-49794","ref":"SPARK-49794","sha":"1f6f52c253c7bec3d60f712f598cca000718b1ee","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the uncaught Java exception from `make_timestamp()` with bad timezone\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve the error message\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the user-facing error message is changed:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> select make_timestamp(1, 2, 28, 23, 1, 1, -100);\r\nInvalid ID for ZoneOffset, invalid format: -100\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```\r\nspark-sql (default)> select make_timestamp(1, 2, 28, 23, 1, 1, -100);\r\n[INVALID_TIMEZONE] The timezone: -100 is invalid.  The timezone must be either a region-based zone ID or a zone offset. Region IDs must have the form ‘area/city’, such as ‘America/Los_Angeles’. Zone offsets must be in the format ‘(+|-)HH’, ‘(+|-)HH:mm’ or ‘(+|-)HH:mm:ss’, e.g ‘-08’, ‘+01:00’ or ‘-13:33:33’., and must be in the range from -18:00 to +18:00. 'Z' and 'UTC' are accepted as synonyms for '+00:00'.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates `DelegatingCatalogExtension` so that it's more extendable\r\n- `initialize` becomes not final, so that sub-classes can overwrite it\r\n- `delegate` becomes `protected`, so that sub-classes can access it\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR fixes a mistake that `DelegatingCatalogExtension` is just a convenient default implementation, it's actually the `CatalogExtension` interface that indicates this catalog implementation will delegate requests to the Spark session catalog. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47724 should use `CatalogExtension` instead. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnblock the Iceberg extension.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport area plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.
