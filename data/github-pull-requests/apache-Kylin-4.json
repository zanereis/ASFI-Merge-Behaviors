Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFix lock when get all properties and fix some file checkstyle\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nadd snapshot and query docs\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch.

The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nadd installation, configuration, operations and search plugins\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently we use properties.list() to get kylin config from properties to string, but this method results in a maximum length limit (which is set as 37 )for each properties. We can leverage the properties.store() method\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-5228), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-5228 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd doc for rest API,  deployment mode in installation and monitoring in operations\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd part doc for deployment\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nKYLIN-5225 update bin/download-spark.sh to spark 3.1.3\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-10T10:25:49Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T01:34:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-12T01:34:09Z","merged_at":"2022-08-12T01:34:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e28c8732a0bf50290584dc047fe48b73890bcae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/99febb85223df281c8d0bd6bc4e7d0fadf278d5b","head":{"label":"shaofengshi:update-spark-download","ref":"update-spark-download","sha":"99febb85223df281c8d0bd6bc4e7d0fadf278d5b","user":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138867562,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg4Njc1NjI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"shaofengshi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nKYLIN-5225 update haddop version and make spark3 as the default profile\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-10T09:56:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T05:44:59Z","closed_at":"2022-08-26T05:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54d439b4bb8f7c736cbf02f24a76e1a5011bfcf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/83b7ebbe2057b3a3a8eb6f9dfee4cc47e0d33c0d","head":{"label":"shaofengshi:fix-security","ref":"fix-security","sha":"83b7ebbe2057b3a3a8eb6f9dfee4cc47e0d33c0d","user":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138867562,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg4Njc1NjI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"shaofengshi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi/kylin","description":"Apache

You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nUpgrade spring-core and spring-security's version to fix https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hh32-7344-cg2f\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nUpgrade spring-core and spring-security's version to fix CVE-2022-22978\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T06:28:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T06:29:04Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T06:29:04Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T06:29:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8d73369e47013a564b263420d4250d87246e7f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/67e381e8e9244cbe0d1c41c56870442cdd10212c","head":{"label":"weiwei121723:init-kylin5","ref":"init-kylin5","sha":"67e381e8e9244cbe0d1c41c56870442cdd10212c","user":{"login":"weiwei121723","id":16216770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16216770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723","html_url":"https://github.com/weiwei121723","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":261679961,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjE2Nzk5NjE=","name":"kylin","full_name":"weiwei121723/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weiwei121723","id":16216770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16216770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723","html_url":"https://github.com/weiwei121723","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiwei121723/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weiwei121723/kylin","description":"Apache

Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T02:48:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T02:49:40Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T02:49:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"555358303a1a685ce3b6ca970f7a9d5f5029eb50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/3174f8ecffc141913ddf222b272c2c50c6a43e5d","head":{"label":"zheniantoushipashi:KYLIN-5217-2","ref":"KYLIN-5217-2","sha":"3174f8ecffc141913ddf222b272c2c50c6a43e5d","user":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":356746005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTY3NDYwMDU=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zheniantoushipashi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T02:42:08Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T02:47:02Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T02:47:02Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T02:47:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"605b4f52ecd607fb6c6943d8014c1a2736254f17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/4301fde6d23b9b23367b3949613d815727f9ff36","head":{"label":"zheniantoushipashi:KYLIN-5217-1","ref":"KYLIN-5217-1","sha":"4301fde6d23b9b23367b3949613d815727f9ff36","user":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":356746005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTY3NDYwMDU=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zheniantoushipashi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T02:38:01Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T02:40:07Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T02:40:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e9eb0c8a29234a3e30039f648a2847001616236","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/d722da6902094a12f1f3e95f7ad202314492b292","head":{"label":"zheniantoushipashi:KYLIN-5217","ref":"KYLIN-5217","sha":"d722da6902094a12f1f3e95f7ad202314492b292","user":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":356746005,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTY3NDYwMDU=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zheniantoushipashi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheniantoushipashi","id":3105102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDUxMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3105102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi","html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheniantoushipashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheniantoushipashi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T03:37:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T02:15:29Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T02:15:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70fc6b86c2480c6234add49913aab120c07e5819","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/62564ef5c9465e3bf88c93773edc249caf5e1ffa","head":{"label":"Mukvin:fix-sonar-0805","ref":"fix-sonar-0805","sha":"62564ef5c9465e3bf88c93773edc249caf5e1ffa","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T11:08:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T02:56:22Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T02:56:22Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T02:56:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"21ec2f4f4d4cf723aa2464650afffd0930aa9d11","assignee":{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/5480dc6cb7518578a83ccbc3ce13c066c0bee4aa","head":{"label":"Mukvin:KYLIN-5218","ref":"KYLIN-5218","sha":"5480dc6cb7518578a83ccbc3ce13c066c0bee4aa","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nRefine second storage package name\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T10:14:29Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T02:15:17Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T02:15:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"961a1b6c62e9b7012d4b0658a63e8eae48e74390","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/46699809b7883a05a86900566e50a761a3351843","head":{"label":"Mukvin:KYLIN-5219","ref":"KYLIN-5219","sha":"46699809b7883a05a86900566e50a761a3351843","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix KYLIN-5130\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent

Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix KYLIN-5130\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\nResolved https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-3610\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSonar cloud reported several critical code issues, I fixed them and passed the integration test.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-15T03:25:49Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T03:03:49Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T03:03:49Z","merged_at":"2022-06-16T03:03:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd4a472e348589ea9c6e0c46edcc4b1a06b0ee38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1875/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1875/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1875/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/80a5b64125866b495add0a4765cf483d6b97464a","head":{"label":"shaofengshi:fixsonar","ref":"fixsonar","sha":"80a5b64125866b495add0a4765cf483d6b97464a","user":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138867562,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg4Njc1NjI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"shaofengshi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn Kylin 4, there are many legacy code inheritated from Kylin 3, while they are not in use anymore. To make the code more readable, need cleanup them.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-14T11:55:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-15T02:12:24Z","closed_at":"2022-05-15T02:12:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4e3e96ee3b3f80a4f38b7f76bbea4848ac69cc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/688631f49a2c72a723f950939a793e181b757bef","head":{"label":"shaofengshi:cleanup","ref":"cleanup","sha":"688631f49a2c72a723f950939a793e181b757bef","user":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138867562,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg4Njc1NjI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"shaofengshi/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shaofengshi","id":5411805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTE4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5411805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi","html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaofengshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shaofengshi/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport posgresql metastore\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T03:31:04Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:21Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:20Z","merged_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e630a46dfbbe2170774a87e811c5840bfc10f083","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/81edb114337b7da0b01c2c1a9f1dc0ff18f677fe","head":{"label":"Mukvin:fix-0412","ref":"fix-0412","sha":"81edb114337b7da0b01c2c1a9f1dc0ff18f677fe","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T02:42:40Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:05Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:05Z","merged_at":"2022-04-12T08:48:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d94583fe7bc5763db028c61453efb863e9b659f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/3c0b08f4a57229301f611dc0857a7c20efc82eae","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:kylin4_on_cloud","ref":"kylin4_on_cloud","sha":"3c0b08f4a57229301f611dc0857a7c20efc82eae","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-11T07:28:10Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T10:53:05Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T10:53:05Z","merged_at":"2022-04-11T10:53:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ab85b4e47fd38eb344223dde7d0d25b4fd44a27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/c229583908a2af1d260c1d22146bf90761a7439e","head":{"label":"Mukvin:fix-0411","ref":"fix-0411","sha":"c229583908a2af1d260c1d22146bf90761a7439e","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-11T03:06:42Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T03:26:23Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T03:26:23Z","merged_at":"2022-04-11T03:26:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"e652b87aad1caea6cca60a82a3665bb4aec90403","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/f103a6a601b57554dc597ed5c2c968848e3d7b20","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:kylin4_on_cloud","ref":"kylin4_on_cloud","sha":"f103a6a601b57554dc597ed5c2c968848e3d7b20","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution
