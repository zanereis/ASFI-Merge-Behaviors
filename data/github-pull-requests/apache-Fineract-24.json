Description\r\n\r\nThe licenses of 3rd party packages we were including in the distribution packages were rather out-of-date. \r\n\r\nInstead of \"hardcoding\" the licenses - which would require a lot of work to keep up-to-date - the build script now automatically pulls in all the licenses of the dependent jars when building the binary distribution, and automatically includes these in the distribution tar file. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Write the commit message as per

pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Follow coding conventions at

Description\r\n\r\n- proper Docker image build with reasonable startup parameters (the ones that were in place until now were not really great)\r\n- using the latest JDK 17 LTS release everywhere (Docker image and workflows)\r\n- Travis builds were failing, some regressions fell through the cracks (the biggest: GSON serializer was missing an adapter; without it was crashing with security exceptions as reflection is not generally allowed anymore); see: \"org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.core.serialization.GoogleGsonSerializerHelper\"\r\n- moved the WAR build into a separate module; it's really unnecessarily hard to make everything work in one build script without making it overly complex; main reason for move: Jib (the Docker build module) detects if a project is of type WAR and starts to do all kind of automatic WAR related configuration; the WAR stuff is not our main deliverable; maybe we can drop it in the future; anyway... still there, just different directory\r\n- I've made some small adjustments in the docker-compose.yml file; this thing is not used anymore for building the Docker images (with this change Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh and .dockerignore also disappeared)\r\n- the integration tests run now with Docker Compose instead of Cargo; no more brittle Mysql configuration and startup; this will run no matter the OS or the environment; now there is only one mechanism that handles everything (via a Docker Compose Gradle plugin)\r\n- with the move to JDK 17 the Travis builds were not working anymore; the main reason was missing JVM arguments in the gradle.properties to make the Gradle Spotless plugin properly work\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x]

Description\r\n\r\nReplacing the Spring XML configuration files with Java classes. As well as making the config much more easily maintainable and simpler, this unblocks the Spring Boot upgrade to 2.5.6. However it is likely to break the OAuth support. As spring-security-oauth2 is deprecated anyway, I'll submit another PR later to rework the oauth2 set-up based on more modern libraries. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [x] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/api-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

Description\r\n\r\nWe currently have four identical copies of application.properties in 4 different directories. The only line that should differ between these is the active profile name (i.e. oauth vs basicauth, twofactor or no twofactor). However these files have not been kept in synch and therefore there are further differences.\r\n\r\nTo avoid having to maintain 4 identical files, with this PR we only have one application.properties.template file. From this, a new application.properties is generated at build time based on the build configuration settings. \r\n\r\nIgnore if these details are present on the associated [Apache Fineract JIRA ticket](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1284).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [x] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/api-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>square/okhttp</summary>\n\n### [`v4.9.2`](https://togithub.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#Version-492)\n\n*2021-09-30*\n\n-   Fix: Don't include potentially-sensitive header values in `Headers.toString()` or exceptions.\n    This applies to `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`, and `Set-Cookie` headers.\n-   Fix: Don't crash with an `InaccessibleObjectException` when running on JDK17+ with strong\n    encapsulation enabled.\n-   Fix: Strictly verify hostnames used with OkHttp's `HostnameVerifier`. Programs that make direct\n    manual calls to `HostnameVerifier` could be defeated if the hostnames they pass in are not\n    strictly ASCII. This issue is tracked as \\[CVE-2021-0341].\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Description\r\n\r\nAs the java.util.Random class relies on a pseudorandom number generator, this class and relating java.lang.Math.random() method should not be used for security-critical applications
