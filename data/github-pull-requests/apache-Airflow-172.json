Questions/alternatives\r\n\r\nA simpler approach for a new engineer here would be if the default airflow docker postgres configuration matched the default postgres connection defined in `airflow/utils/db.py`. That is, `postgres_default` defines username (er \"login\") `postgres`, while the airflow `docker-compose.yml` file uses login `airflow`.

the PR (origin: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17502)\r\nWhy I commit this change:\r\n\r\nWhen checking the airflow features, I found that the dag run_id is generated using the UTC time, but actually, it is not convenient for us to use the UTC time because we are using local time.\r\nFor example, I am in Beijing now, I ran a DAG at 19:01, the default run_id is manual__2021-09-08T11:01:02.022226+08:00, but after a few hours, I want to find this run, I have to parse the local time to UTC time to get the specific dag_run. If the run_id is generated using local time, the run_id will be manual__2021-09-08T19:01:02.022226+08:00, I can easily find this dag_run.\r\nHow do I change:\r\n\r\nAdded a config localize_dag_run_id in the core config and the default value is False. It takes no effect if the user doesn't care about the dag run_id format. If the users who just like me want to use the local time to generate the run_id, they can set it to True\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nimage","created_at":"2021-10-18T02:54:30Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T00:07:19Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T00:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be7a47f4cd52b9c2fb38cbff3552c6cd7ed24c33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airfl

I would like some opinions on this PR, it has no open issue,\r\nbut it's something I have encountered and fix locally in Airflow 2.0.2, and the code hasn't change in main branch.\r\n\r\nPlease note this PR has two main changes:\r\n\r\n- adding a missing feature, aligning functionality with similar Operator\r\n- refactoring for efficiency and responsivness sake\r\n\r\n1. DockerOperator has** the option to send the entire container log into xcom return_value, not just the last line\r\nEcsOperator doesn't have this option, it defaults to only sending the last line, This commit changes that behaviour, adding xcom_all parameter to the Operator, to enable sending all logs lines.\r\n\r\n2. In addition, the get_last_log_message function has been refactored,\r\nIn an edge case where the log is bigger than 1 MB (up to 10,000 log events) as per aws docs,\r\nit is possible that the function would cause more than one 'GetLogEvents' AWS API call because it defaults to read the logstream/group from beginning,\r\nand using deque with queue size of 1, it would iterate over the entire generator yields, calling get_log_events as much as it needs,\r\njust so that when the generator is exhausted, the queue would keep only the last event, this is a waste of time and data transfer,\r\nAWS get_log_events method has start_from_head parameter, which can be used to actually tail the event log instead of reading from head!\r\nin combination with a single next() yield, we can ensure we only call get_log_events once, and within the response, grab the last message\r\n\r\n** DockerOperator is actually also unstable in regard to xcoms, see issue #18874 and PR #19027","created_at":"2021-10-17T05:46:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T00:07:09Z","closed_at":"2021-12-18T00:07:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e61fb17b79a9d0e89e51dbe74319619ae6318e64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

in the web UI on task instance details page, if a task is in the \"up for retry\" state\r\nwe will see this message:\r\n\r\n> Task is in the up_for_retry state which is not a valid state for execution. The task must be cleared in order to be run.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there's nothing really \"invalid\" about this state -- it's expected that sometimes tasks will fail, then be in up-for-retry state before being retried.  So, it is a valid state, and it will get picked up after the retry interval.\r\n\r\nBut the language \"The task must be cleared in order to be run\" suggests to the user \"you need to clear this in order for this task to run\".  But this is not true.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is not simple to make it clearer, because this function is used for a lot of different scenarios.  For example, checking for \"schedulable\" tasks, and \"queueable\" tasks. So not only would we need to keep track of which states actually require user intervention, but the desired action (e.g. queue vs schedule vs run). \r\n\r\nSo I think the best course of action is to amend this to say less, i.e. to say only what is always true, which is simply the state.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-17T02:38:52Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T19:16:20Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T11:11:23Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T11:11:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"72679bef3abee141dd20f75d6ff977bd3978ecc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

#18874\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt at fixing DockerOperator xcoms behavior, \r\nThe fix is keeping the existing attach to docker's log stream for 'live' airflow logging for long-running docker containers with progress output, but asking for docker logs after the container exited for xcoms usage (either last line, or all lines),\r\nthus restoring the behavior documented here: \r\nhttps://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-docker/stable/_api/airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker/index.html#airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker.DockerOperator\r\n\r\n> xcom_all (bool) -- Push all the stdout or just the last line. The default is False (last line).\r\n\r\nPlease note, I do not know how Mocks works in the testing files, and so, I don't think I can do much about tests for this PR,\r\nthe current tests for this functionality exist and are currently (before this PR) passing,\r\neven though they shouldn't, as described in #18874\r\n\r\nthe Tests are located

useless for discovering this issue, and I personally don't know enough about airflow pytest/unittest setup to propose a change to make them better, any help or additional commit into this PR is

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17546 issue with\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: cannot allocate memory in\r\nstatic TLS block.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet a more \"correct\" solution

practice the liveness probe can regularly take longer than 5 seconds.  \r\n\r\n10 seems like a better default. \r\n\r\nBecause it seems to take longer than perhaps initially expected, it seems reasonable to reduce the check frequency to not consume as much CPU.  Though perhaps there's a reason for checking more frequently, so whatever you think on that...\r\n\r\nTo keep the max downtime to 5 minutes after increasing the check period, I reduce number of failed checks to 5.\r\n\r\ncloses

I haven't had a chance to test the other operators, but I suspect that they are broken in the same way.

As it is based on the SSH hook, which does allow for a private key string to be used, a small change could align these two hooks.\r\n\r\nThis change first checks if a paramiko object is present after the SSH hook has been initialised, and the prefers that rather than the ssh key file path.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces stale PR

PR adds codespell to the pre-commit hooks. This will specifically help\r\nus a bit in resolving sphinx errors.\r\n\r\nFrom the project page:\r\nIt does not check for word membership in a complete dictionary, but instead looks for a set of common misspellings.\r\nTherefore it should catch errors like \"adn\", but it will not catch \"adnasdfasdf\".\r\nThis also means it shouldn't generate false-positives when you use a niche term it doesn't know about.\r\n\r\nThis means the sphinx errors are not solved completely.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear your thoughts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

(at least called out/editable)\r\n- ensures the CSV file is properly formatted with newlines and no blank lines\r\n- removes a postgres constraint id violation\r\n- modifies the csv import code to support a header row\r\n- updates sample CSV with auto-incrementing (low) IDs rather than scientific notation with duplicates\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/18950 \r\n\r\n##

This can be in a subsequent PR.\r\n- the 'write this CSV to a file' code could still be further optimized. There's no need to 'split on newline then write back with newlines', I think the CSV file can be written

documented in the official Pendulum docs.\r\n\r\nAdded the following: \r\n\r\n- Mention the upgrade from `1.x` to `2.x`\r\n- Added an example of a code snippet that will now throw errors\r\n- Added link to official pendulum `2.x` docs that discuss the changes from `1.x` to `2.x`\r\n\r\nThe macros documentation as mentioned in the issue were actually pointing to the updated Pendulum documentation, so no changes were added for the same. For instance, consider the link for the macro [prev_execution_date](https://pendulum.eustace.io/docs/#introduction)\r\n\r\nAs it was a documentation update, didn't run any

#18894.\r\n\r\nInstead of failing loudly for invalid records (which happens way too often), this attempts to move those offending data to another table and carry on with the migration if possible. This table for dangling data are copied with `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...` and could miss some indexing and stuff, but this is only meant for temporary storage, so this is probably not a big deal. If copying went well, the dangling data are automatically deleted so we can carry on with migration.\r\n\r\nThis also _removed_ the upgrade check on TaskFail and _added_ TaskReschedule. This is because TaskFail is not actually being migrated in 2.2, while TaskReschedule is, and we concluded this is likely a typo during implementation and not an intentional choice.","created_at":"2021-10-13T16:52:09Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T21:55:55Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T17:09:55Z","merged_at":"2021-10-14T17:09:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"f967ca91058b4296edb507c7826282050188b501","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

#15072, cc @ephraimbuddy \r\n\r\nIt turns out Connexion performs argument introspection to decide what arguments to pass to an endpoint (a bit like pytest fixtures), so we can't actually make the functions _too_ generic. For example, we must have a parameter named `connection_id` in various Connection endpoints, but that's obvious specific to Connection and cannot be refactored out. So this two-layer approach is the best I can come up with for now.\r\n\r\nI'm not actually convinced myself if this is a good idea (it feels like a ton of architecture that makes code more difficult to understand), but at least now we have something to think about.","created_at":"2021-10-13T07:05:26Z","updated_at":"2022-01-16T00:08:31Z","closed_at":"2022-01-16T00:08:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fad552d959acd75156701ec2287861bf373038df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

Then we have users bring up their own dev environments, but when they load the dags (mono-repo), the dags will fail due to the roles not existing. So part of our deploy tools for users to setup their dev environments, we import the roles from a central file. I.e. we export the roles from the production periodically to a file that we push to s3, and then for dev, we import the roles from that file.\r\nWe keep it as local file to maintain flexibility. We also use this feature to just backup the roles in case.\r\nWe do not allow dev hosts talk to the productions dbs/hosts for security and permission concerns.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the use case:\r\n```\r\nStep 1 : airflow roles list\r\nExisting roles:\r\n╒════════════╕\r\n│ Role │\r\n╞════════════╡\r\n│ Admin │\r\n├────────────┤\r\n│ Op │\r\n├────────────┤\r\n│ Public
