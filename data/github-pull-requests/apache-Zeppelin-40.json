Secondly, there're modifications to existing versioning api, with considerations of future complete implementation of versioning. Note that this PR doesn't implement all suggested interfaces, but lays foundation for their implementation.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement && Refactoring\n### Todos\n- [x] - move versioning api (get, history) from NotebookRepoVersioned to NotebookRepo\n- [x] - refactor and naming changes\n- [x] - modify checkpoint api (add return value) and modify NotebookRepoSync to deal with it\n### What is the Jira issue?\n### How should this be tested?\n\nBasically it doesn't add new functionality, so the only requirement is for tests to pass.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? not breaking, but some api changes\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T22:31:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T02:38:32Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T01:34:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bedc82891780ce9331769a6864f7e2ae05c9f92e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f900058f42dcdd1c965a6e140881b3e46f95b173","head":{"label":"khalidhuseynov:repo/versioning-api-update","ref":"repo/versioning-api-update","sha":"f900058f42dcdd1c965a6e140881b3e46f95b173","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33517255,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzUxNzI1NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR is to automate release publish to maven repository.\nWe used to use maven-deploy-plugin and maven-release-plugin for release but somehow it didn't work well with Zeppelin so 0.5.5 and 0.5.6 haven't been published to maven repository.\n\nPublishing release to maven repository will eventually help zeppelin to reduce binary package size by leading users to use Dynamic interpreter loading(#908).\nOriginally below modules were skipped for maven release\n- all interpreters(except spark)\n- zeppelin-display\n- zeppelin-server \n- zeppelin-distribution\n\non the other hand this pr will skip only:\n- zeppelin-distribution\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nInfra\n### Todos\n- [x] Include SparkR/R interpreter in release\n- [x] Create common_release.sh to remove build configuration duplication\n- [x] Check curl networking failure\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-986](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-986)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes, https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZEPPELIN/Preparing+Zeppelin+Release will be updated accordingly once this pr is

What is this PR for?\n\nError:\nInsufficient privileges to write notebook.\nAllowed users or roles: [admin, zeppelinWrite]\nBut the user randerson belongs to: [randerson]\nIt's seems clear that user randerson isn't mapped to any roles, or groups (even though he of course is a member of the zeppelinWrite group in AD and as a result also part of the local admin Role). A TCPDUMP reveals that during login, all of my group memberships are in fact returned during the ldap bind operation. However, when I attempt to modify a notebook, a call is never made to AD, to pull back my group memberships. It doesn't seem to look at my local group memberships (/etc/group) either.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- [x] - fix for permissions not honoring group\n- [x] - read roles from shiro.ini\n- [x] - at times group name was displaying instead of user/principal name.\n- [x] - doc\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-946](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-946)\n### Screenshots/How should this be tested?\n\nUse one of the following setting for IniRealm, LDAP or AD in shiro.ini\n\n```\n[main]\nadmin = password1, admin\nfinance1 = finance1, finance\nfinance2 = finance2, finance\nhr1 = hr1, hr\nhr2 = hr2, hr\n\n\nactiveDirectoryRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.server.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm\nactiveDirectoryRealm.systemUsername = userNameA\nactiveDirectoryRealm.systemPassword = passwordA\nactiveDirectoryRealm.searchBase = CN=Users,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\nactiveDirectoryRealm.url = ldap://ldap.test.com:389\nactiveDirectoryRealm.groupRolesMap = \"CN=admin,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"admin\",\"CN=finance,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"finance\",\"CN=hr,OU=groups,DC=SOME_GROUP,DC=COMPANY,DC=COM\":\"hr\"\nactiveDirectoryRealm.authorizationCachingEnabled = false\n\n\nldapRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.server.LdapGroupRealm\n# search base for ldap groups (only relevant for LdapGroupRealm):\nldapRealm.contextFactory.environment[ldap.searchBase] = dc=COMPANY,dc=COM\nldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://ldap.test.com:389\nldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=Users,dc=COMPANY,dc=COM\nldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism = SIMPLE\n\n[roles]\nadmin = *\nhr = *\nfinance = *\ngroup1 = *\n\n[urls]\n/api/version = anon\n/** = authc\n```\n\nLogin as user1 (say finance1), and set a permission of a notebook as \"finance\"\n<img width=\"1282\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-11 at 9 50 32 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/15983178/aad710ee-2fbc-11e6-861d-508ecc8c7b74.png\">\n\nSave setting\n<img width=\"1281\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-11 at 9 51 05 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/15983180/aad86ea8-2fbc-11e6-8b68-4571496ec733.png\">\n\nNow logout and login as user2 (say finance2) which belong to the same group as above \"finance\", verify that you have access to the same notebook.\n<img width=\"1282\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-11 at 9 51 25 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/15983181/aad9a78c-2fbc-11e6-8a41-a3dc108cabdc.png\">\n\nLogout and login again, this time as a user that does not belong to the group \"finance\", a user say hr1.

What is this PR for?\n\nWhen people implement a new interpreter, they extend [interpreter.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java) as described in [here](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/development/writingzeppelininterpreter.html). Among the several methods in [interpreter.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java), [completion API](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java#L109) enables auto-completion.\n\nHowever this API is too simple compared to other project's auto-completion and hard to add more at the moment. So for the aspect of further expansion, it would be better to separate and restructure this API before the this release( 0.6.0 ).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Create new structure : `InterpreterCompletion` in `RemoteInterpreterService.thrift` and regenerate `zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/thrift/*` files \n- [x] - Change all existing `List<String> completion` -> `List<InterpreterCompletion> completion` \n- [x] - Change `paragraph.controller.js` to point real `name` and `value`\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-982](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-982)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nSince this improvement is just API change, it should work same as before. So after applying this patch, and check whether auto-completion works well or not. \n\nUse `. + ctrl` for auto-completion. For example,\n\n```\n%spark \nsc.version\n```\n\nWhen after typing `sc.` and pushing  `. + ctrl` down, `version` should be shown in the auto-completion list. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![auto_completion](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15952521/72937782-2e76-11e6-8246-4faf0dd77a5b.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-06-10T02:18:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T15:04:54Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T15:04:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b93d42f530e0c6992cbccbc2912c2108c846717b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/311dc2958324b2af9ae4c177988266459872e050","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-982","ref":"ZEPPELIN-982","sha":"311dc2958324b2af9ae4c177988266459872e050","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

of receiving the information as one of the notebook.\nfocus on \"lastResponseUnixTime\" value.\nThis value is inserted as an argument when you call the following restapi, us to be able to get the updated data.\n\n**Create a Notebook, or run the Paragraph.**\nAnd, **call updated notebook api**\n\n**\"lastResponseUnixTime\": 1465289938763** (step 1 get value)\n\n``` shell\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/notebook/jobmanager/1465289938763\n```\n#### step 3.\n\nIf you created a Notebook, a new Notebook information is displayed.\nIf there is a Notebook that if there is a Paragraph of the running, the information will also be displayed.\n#### step 4.\n\nWhen you restart the step1 of api, if you created a Notebook, the number of Notebook is +1 than when the first call.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no \n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nWhile Apache Ignite version in Zeppelin was bumped up by #916, but ignite build flag in [README.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/README.md#ignite-interpreter) is outdated so far. So I just changed `1.1.0-incubating` -> `1.6.0`. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nHot Fix\n### Todos\n### What is the Jira issue?\n### How should this be tested?\n\nJust see [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/README.md#ignite-interpreter).\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-06-06T23:18:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T14:28:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-08T14:28:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f322cc3244c24f103591974b401fdbc64c56c58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/20d01557f2be89d04f1af776e770dbc725c78fe3","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:update/README.md","ref":"update/README.md","sha":"20d01557f2be89d04f1af776e770dbc725c78fe3","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\n**Cassandra** interpreter V3:\n- Update documentation\n- Update interactive documentation\n- Add support for binary protocol **V4**\n- Implement new `@requestTimeOut` runtime option\n- Upgrade Java driver version to **3.0.1**\n- Allow interpreter to add dynamic forms programmatically when using `FormType.SIMPLE`\n- Allow dynamic form using default Zeppelin syntax\n- Fixing typo on `FallThroughPolicy`\n- Look for data in `AngularObjectRegistry` before creating dynamic form\n- Add missing support for `ALTER` statements\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Test steps executed and confirmed working by the community\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-901](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-901)**\n### How should this be tested?\n- Download and install locally **[Cassandra 3.5](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/)**\n- Start **Cassandra**\n- Clone this pull request locally with:\n  - `git fetch origin pull/950/head:CassandraInterpreterV3`\n  - `git checkout CassandraInterpreterV3`\n- Build this version of **Zeppelin** with `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\n- Start Zeppelin and update the property `cassandra.hosts` of the **Cassandra** interpreter (set it to _localhost_ or _127.0.0.1_ depending on your configuration)\n- To test the `ALTER` statement, create a new paragraph with the following content:\n\n```\n%cassandra\n\nCREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS cassandra_v3 WITH REPLICATION = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cassandra_v3.simple(key int PRIMARY KEY);\nALTER TABLE cassandra_v3.simple ADD value text;\nDESCRIBE TABLE cassandra_v3.simple;\n```\n\nThe result of this paragraph should be:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/15740044/6062bba4-28b3-11e6-818e-e257d0830041.png)\n- To test the support for **Zeppelin** dynamic form syntax, create a paragraph with the following content:\n\n```\n%cassandra\n\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first'); \nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');\n\nSELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key=${key=1};\n```\n\nThe result of this paragraph should be:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/15740146/d7b696f8-28b3-11e6-80c5-428ae97558f6.png)\n- To test the legacy syntax for dynamic form, create a new paragraph with the following content:\n\n```\n%cassandra\n\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first'); \nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');\n\nSELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key={{key=1|2|3}};\n```\n\nThe result of this paragraph should be:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/15740377/ebb018ea-28b4-11e6-9cde-b3aad50bbaef.png)\n- To test the override of `AngularObject` upon dynamic form, create 2 new paragraphs with the following content\n\nFirst paragraph content:\n\n```\n%angular\n\n<form class=\"form-inline\">\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"keyId\">Key: </label>\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"keyId\" placeholder=\"key id ...\" ng-model=\"key_id\"></input>\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.angularBind('key_id',key_id,'PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID'); z.runParagraph('PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID')\"> Bind</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nSecond paragraph content:\n\n```\n%cassandra\n\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(1, 'first'); \nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(2, 'second');\nINSERT INTO cassandra_v3.simple(key,value) VALUES(3, 'third');\n\nSELECT * FROM cassandra_v3.simple WHERE key={{key_id=1}};\n```\n\nReplace `PUT_HERE_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_ID` in the angular code of the first paragraph by the real paragraph id of the second paragraph. Execute the first paragraph, put a value into the input text (3) and click on **Bind**, you should see the following result:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/15740626/e9d9deba-28b5-11e6-9708-f040a8d58ccd.png)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? --> **No**\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? --> **No**\n- Does this needs documentation? --> **Yes**\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T09:06:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T01:32:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T01:32:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7344003af70643066334c25565fa1c682eb06b58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/abd42e32d05c5bf4eb41c5820379d04f4b79c8be","head":{"label":"doanduyhai:CassandraInterpreterV3","ref":"CassandraInterpreterV3","sha":"abd42e32d05c5bf4eb41c5820379d04f4b79c8be","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35973266,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk3MzI2Ng==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently Zeppelin provides authorization mechanism on each notebooks. But it seems many users can not get much useful information through [the existing notebook authorization docs](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/notebook_authorization.html). So I add some information so that users can follow step by step. \n\nMoreover,  [interpreter authorization docs](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/interpreter_authorization.html) doesn't provide much information so far. This can be confused to users. So I removed it temporally. We can add it again when we have specific(?) feature for `interpreter & data source authorization`.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement | Documentation\n### Todos\n- [x] - Remove security_overview.md & interpreter_authorization.md\n- [x] - Improve notebook authorization docs\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-939](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-939)\n### How should this be tested?\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- **Before**\n  <img width=\"1107\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-01 at 5 46 22 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15730358/cf8074ec-2820-11e6-8e55-d0552896d95d.png\">\n- **After**\n  <img width=\"1030\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-01 at 5 48 17 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15730384/1b6c8a08-2821-11e6-89ae-7d054ec87c57.png\">\n  <img width=\"1007\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-01 at 5 48 31 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15730386/1ea6e42a-2821-11e6-9630-da2ca67970f0.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently available interpreter list is not shown in `Creating New Interpreter` section. It seems this bug was generated after #835 was merged. So I temporally deactivated [3 SerializedName code lines](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/945/commits/6d7f1bc43437e8a876eef1a3e36a17fbd5805cb1). \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### Todos\n- [x] - Fix interpreter listing bug when creating new interpreter \n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-931](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-931)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Build latest master branch and browse Zeppelin home\n2. Create new interpreter -> You can not see the available interpreter list in this step like below attached screenshot \n3. Apply this patch\n4. Build again and browse  -> You can see the available interpreter list as normal\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- **Before**\n  <img width=\"1273\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-01 at 12 36 42 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15723066/9082435e-27f5-11e6-9783-df44638dbbec.png\">\n- **After**\n  <img width=\"1273\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-01 at 12 33 06 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/15723067/92bcc8ce-27f5-11e6-82f5-6c0db7b4342c.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?
