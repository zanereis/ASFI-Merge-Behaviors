is logically restricting the migration of local storages to shared storage and vice versa. This restriction is a logical one and can be removed for XenServer deployments. Therefore, we will enable migration of volumes between local-shared storages in XenServers independently of their service offering. This will work as an override mechanism to the disk offering used by volumes. If administrators want to migrate local volumes to a shared storage, they should be able to do so (the hypervisor already allows that). The same the other way around.\r\n\r\nExtra information for reviewers:\r\nThis PS is introducing an overriding mechanism for volumes placement. We are providing a way for root administrators to override service/disk offering definitions by allocation volumes in storage pools that they could not have been allocated before if we followed their(volumes) service/disk offerings.\r\nTherefore, it will not change the type of disk/service offerings when migrating volumes between local/shared pools. We will simply migrate them as requested by root admin. Furthermore, volumes will only be able to migrate to \"suitable\" storage pools. This means, storage pools that have same tags as the disk/service offering.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we are overriding placement considering location (shared/local) storage pools. However, we still consider storage tags to decide which storage pools are suitable or not.","created_at":"2018-01-23T19:33:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-07T21:23:15Z","closed_at":"2018-03-07T21:23:15Z","merged_at":"2018-03-07T21:23:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2efbcececb3cfb06a51e5d3a2e77417c19c667f","assignee":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073184,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:XenServer","name":"component:XenServer","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073278,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:primary-storage","name":"component:primary-storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":817420428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MTc0MjA0Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"a5f9ff","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4/labels","id":3009550,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAwOTU1MA==","number":4,"title":"4.12.0.0","description":"Milestone for PRs targetted for the next major 4.12.0.0 release.

is an issue that was introduced in the code-review process of #2298.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably the simplest solution (and what this PR does) is to store the result of MapUtils.isNotEmpty(mapMigrateStorage) before passing mapMigrateStorage to the replaceStorage method.\r\n\r\nThe replaceStorage method can mutate the data in the passed-in map, thus leading to a different result for MapUtils.isNotEmpty(mapMigrateStorage) later on (and causing an issue for online storage migration).\r\n\r\nIf we just store the value up front and refer to it later, we, of course, get the same (boolean) result and online storage migration works properly.\r\n\r\nA more long-term solution (and one that I plan on implementing for 4.12) would be to make a shallow copy of the map inside of replaceStorage so that replaceStorage does not actually mutate the data in the original map. While that isn't a difficult solution to implement, I feel the one I have implemented in this PR is safer as we are in the release-candidate process already.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the JIRA ticket:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10244\r\n\r\nI have tested the code and validated that it works.\r\n\r\nThis use case only applies to online storage migration from NFS or Ceph to managed storage, which is a new feature for 4.11.","created_at":"2018-01-20T04:52:35Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T19:50:50Z","closed_at":"2018-01-21T10:19:57Z","merged_at":"2018-01-21T10:19:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ca264ca4d78d89f7f190d6e4c6af81f5f3d7569","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592953226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI5NTMyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:BLOCKER","name":"Severity:BLOCKER","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3/labels","id":2457915,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNQ==","number":3,"title":"4.11.0.0","description":"This

is an issue that was introduced in the code-review process of https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2298.\r\n\r\nWhat is probably the simplest solution (and what this PR does) is to store the result of MapUtils.isNotEmpty(mapMigrateStorage) before passing mapMigrateStorage to the replaceStorage method.\r\n\r\nThe replaceStorage method can mutate the data in the passed-in map, thus leading to a different result for MapUtils.isNotEmpty(mapMigrateStorage) later on (and causing an issue for online storage migration).\r\n\r\nIf we just store the value up front and refer to it later, we, of course, get the same (boolean) result and online storage migration works properly.\r\n\r\nA more long-term solution (and one that I plan on implementing for 4.12) would be to make a shallow copy of the map inside of replaceStorage so that replaceStorage does not actually mutate the data in the original map. While that isn't a difficult solution to implement, I feel the one I have implemented in this PR is safer as we are in the release-candidate process already.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the JIRA ticket:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10244\r\n\r\nI have tested the code and validated that it works.\r\n\r\nThis use case only applies to online storage migration from NFS or Ceph to managed storage, which is a new feature for 4.11.","created_at":"2018-01-19T22:52:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T19:50:52Z","closed_at":"2018-01-20T04:53:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cecc1931f6b7a7a51f3f984884ac8371ecc3733c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592953226,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI5NTMyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:BLOCKER","name":"Severity:BLOCKER","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3/labels","id":2457915,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNQ==","number":3,"title":"4.11.0.0","description":"This

to a race condition between multiple management servers, in some rare cases, CloudStack is creating multiple file SRs to the same secondary folder. This causes a problem when introducing the SR to the XenServer pools, as “there will be VDIs with duplicated UUIDs“. The VDIs are the same, but they are seen in different SRs, and therefore cause an error.\r\n\r\nThe solution to avoid race conditions between management servers is to use a deterministic srUuid for the file SR to be created (we are leaving XenServer with the burden of managing race conditions). The UUID is based on the SR file path and is generated using  `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes`. Therefore, if there is an SR with the generated UUID, this means that some other management server has just created it. An exception will occur and it will contain a message saying 'Db_exn.Uniqueness_constraint_violation'. In these unlikely events, we catch the exception and use the method `retrieveAlreadyConfiguredSrWithoutException` to get the SR that has already been created for the given mount point.","created_at":"2018-01-19T18:07:05Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T10:00:45Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T18:55:43Z","merged_at":"2018-03-29T18:55:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"060715e9f5f929804b7f515cfba0b4b130581876","assignee":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcaurele","id":1081566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele","html_url":"https://github.com/marcaurele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073184,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:XenServer","name":"component:XenServer","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4/labels","id":3009550,"node_id":"MDk6TWl

is importing as Local storage any XenServer SR that is of type LVM or EXT. This causes a problem when one wants to use both Direct attach storage and local storage. Moreover, CloudStack was not importing all of the local storage that a host has available when local storage is enabled. It was only importing the First SR it sees.\r\n\r\nTo fix the first problem we started ignoring SRs that have the flag shared=true when discovering local storages.

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10146\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThis feature allows using templates and ISOs avoiding secondary storage as intermediate cache on KVM. The virtual machine deployment process is enhanced to supported bypassed registered templates and ISOs, delegating the work of downloading them to primary storage to the KVM agent instead of the SSVM agent.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n#### Template and ISO registration: \r\n- When hypervisor is KVM, a checkbox is displayed with 'Direct Download' label.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/34463109-5baa48e4-ee31-11e7-9eef-8e270ce00ddd.png)\r\n- API methods `registerTemplate` and `registerISO` are both extended with this new parameter `directdownload`.\r\n- On template or ISO registration, no download job is sent to SSVM agent, CloudStack would only persist an entry on `template_store_ref` indicating that template or ISO has been marked as 'Direct Download' (bypassing Secondary Storage). These entries are persisted as:\r\n   - template_id = Template or ISO id on vm_template table\r\n   - store_id NULL\r\n   - download_state = BYPASSED\r\n   - state = Ready\r\n(Note: these entries allow users to deploy virtual machine from registered templates or ISOs)\r\n- An URL validation command is sent to a random KVM host to check if template/ISO location can be reached. Metalink are also supported by this feature. In case of a metalink, it is fetched and URL check is performed on each of its URLs.\r\n- Checksum should be provided as indicated on #2246: `{ALGORITHM}CHKSUMHASH`\r\n- After template or ISO is registered, it would be displayed in the UI as:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/34463248-de728ee2-ee33-11e7-90ad-042475cc96e8.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/34463246-cc195226-ee33-11e7-90c9-3595cad6050a.png)\r\n\r\n#### Virtual machine deployment\r\n- When a 'Direct Download' template is selected for deployment, CloudStack would delegate template downloading to destination storage pool via destination host by a new pluggable download manager. \r\n- Download manager would handle template downloading depending on URL protocol. In case of HTTP, request headers can be set by the user via vm_template_details. Those details should be persisted as:\r\n   - Key: HTTP_HEADER\r\n   - Value: HEADERNAME:HEADERVALUE\r\nIn case of HTTPS, a new API method is added `uploadTemplateDirectDownloadCertificate` to allow user importing a client certificate into all KVM hosts' keystore before deployment.\r\n- After template or ISO is downloaded to primary storage, usual entry would be persisted on `template_spool_ref` indicating the mapping between template/ISO and storage pool.\r\n

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10126\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis extends work presented on #2048 on which the ability to extend the management range is provided. \r\n\r\n### Aim\r\nThis PR allows separating the management network subnet on which SSVM and CPVM are from the virtual routers management subnet.\r\n\r\n### Detailed use case\r\nPCI compliance requires that network elements are defined as ‘in scope’ or ‘out of scope’, for compliance purposes. The SSVM and CPVM are both in scope as they allow public HTTP or HTTPS connections. The virtual routers have been defined as out of scope as they have been placed entirely in a firewalled network's segment. However, all of the system VM types share management network. As SSVM and CPVM are both in scope this would bring the virtual routers into scope as well, requiring individual audits of every virtual router. As this is not practical, the ‘management network’ which the SSVM and CPVM are on, and the management network which the virtual routers are on, must be separated by a firewall.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nBy this feature it is possible to dedicate a created range for SSVM and CPVM (system vms) and provide a VLAN ID for its range.\r\n\r\nA new boolean global configuration is added: system.vm.management.ip.reservation.mode.strictness. If enabled, the use of System VMs management IP reservation is strict, preferred if not. Default value is false (preferred).\r\n- Strict reservation: System VMs should try to get a private IP from a range marked for system vms. If not available, deployment fails\r\n- Preferred reservation: System VMS will try to get a private IP from a range marked for system vms. If not available, IP for range not marked for system vms is taken.\r\n\r\n### UI Changes\r\n- Management range creation:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/34187659-4b99b404-e511-11e7-86a3-9db473fe87b0.png)\r\n\r\n- Ranges dedicated for system vms are marked with checkbox under 'System VMs' column:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/34187735-9fda235a-e511-11e7-85eb-9191d42658e7.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-20T02:13:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:51:03Z","closed_at":"2018-01-05T07:49:04Z","merged_at":"2018-01-05T07:49:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf4f1bbb90a7ac05c7d40b1e5667186a646a25f7","assignee":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073307,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:secondary-storage","name":"component:secondary-storage","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073427,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM0Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:console-proxy","name":"component:console-proxy","color":"15E8EE","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3/labels","id":2457915,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNQ==","number":3,"title":"4.11.0.0","description":"This

found bug in ACL rules for PrivateGateway for VPC\r\n\r\nAt a glance - rules not applied - switching Allow All or Deny All (default ACL) - showed as completed - but rules missed.\r\nResult - traffic via PrivateGateway blocked by next DROP rule in next chains\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Enable PrivateGateway for Cloudstack\r\n2. Create VPC\r\n3. Provision new PrivateGateway inside VPC with some VLAN\r\n4. Change ACL (optional step to show that problem not in initial configuration but in config itself)\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nACL rules applied (inserted) into correspondig ACL_INBOUND/OUTBOUND chanins for PrivateGateway interface (ethX) based on ACL which user choose\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\nNo rules inserted. ACL_INBOUND/OUTBOUND_ethX - empty. Traffic blocked by next DROP rule in FORWARD chain\r\n\r\nAffect - all our corporate customers blocked with access to their own nets via PG and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nIssue happened because of CsNetFilter.py logic for inserting rules for ACL_INBOUND/OUTBOUND chains.\r\n\r\nWe choose rule numebr to isnert right before last DROP rule - but forget about fact - that if chain empty - we also return 0 as insert position. Which not true for iptables - numeration started from 0.\r\n\r\nSo we need very small patch to handle this special case - if number of rules inside chain equal to zero - return 1, else - return count of rules inside chain.\r\n\r\nIt's found only one - just because be default for PrivateGateway - we didn't insert any \"service rules\" (if SourceNat for PrivateGteway not ticked) - and we have by default empty ACL_INBOUND/OUTBOUND chains. Because same insert happened for all VPC networks (but when we call this insert - we already have at least 1 rule inside chains - and we successfully can process)\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10200","created_at":"2017-12-20T00:50:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T09:25:49Z","closed_at":"2017-12-21T09:25:49Z","merged_at":"2017-12-21T09:25:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"12f526bbfee0a76c564f1159b6c77fd5eabf6f4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/3/labels","id":2457915,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNQ==","number":3,"title":"4.11.0.0","description":"This

CloudStack gets GPU capability through NVIDIA GRID K1 and GRID K2 cards only on the XenServer Host. Now, XenServer 6.5 SP1 has added support for NVIDIA Maxwell card(Tesla M60), which supports both Passthrough and vGPU features. This improvement would allow the user to get benefits of Telsa GPU cards while deploying a VM with GPU enabled.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Tesla M60:\r\n=================\r\n1. The Tesla M60 card supports latest NVIDIA GRID 2.0 technology.\r\n2. The Tesla M60 can run more VMs per server. It supports a maximum of 128 VMs on a XenServer 6.5 SP1 host.\r\n3. Now It can run on a blade server and supports vGPU on Linux VMs.(Only on M60-8Q, M60-4Q, M60-2Q, M60-1Q, M60-0Q)\r\n4. The Tesla M60 card supports a maximum resolution of 2560 X 1600.\r\n5. Tesla M60 has a maximum CUDA core of 4096 on both the GPUs (2048 each).\r\n\r\nTesla M60 Virtual GPU Types:\r\n======================\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical GPUs | GRID Virtual GPU | Frame Buffer (MB) | Virtual Display Heads | Maximum Resolution per Display Head | Maximum vGPUs per GPU | Maximum vGPU per Board\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n2 | M60-8Q | 8192 | 4 | 4096×2160 | 1 | 2\r\n2 | M60-4Q | 4096 | 4 | 4096×2160 | 2 | 4\r\n2 | M60-2Q | 2048 | 4 | 4096×2160 | 4 | 8\r\n2 | M60-1Q | 1024 | 2 | 4096×2160 | 8 | 16\r\n2 | M60-0Q | 512 | 2 | 2560×1600 | 16 | 32\r\n2 | M60-1B | 1024 | 4 | 2560×1600 | 8 | 16\r\n2 | M60-0B | 512 | 2 | 2560×1600 | 16 | 32\r\n2 | M60-8A | 8192 | 1 | 1280×1024 | 1 | 2\r\n2 | M60-4A | 4096 | 1 | 1280×1024 | 2 | 4\r\n2 | M60-2A | 2048 | 1 | 1280×1024 | 4 | 8\r\n2 | M60-1A | 1024 | 1 | 1280×1024 | 8 | 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n========\r\n[1] https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2015/11/06/nvidia-m60-support-on-xenserver/\r\n[2] http://hcl.xenserver.org/gpus/28/Nvidia_Tesla_M60\r\n[3] http://images.nvidia.com/content/grid/pdf/GRID-vGPU-User-Guide.pdf\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n====\r\n1. The change is not tested against the Tesla M60 card.\r\n2. If any community user has the physical card available in their lab, I request you to test this change and report the result. I would appreciate that.\r\n3. The Marvin tests were run against NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2 cards, the result is successful.","created_at":"2017-11-26T13:57:59Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T16:00:56Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T16:00:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a96323e3cfff02e43c2cdce3b72c6545298e37a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073184,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:XenServer","name":"component:XenServer","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/2c6bf0f1c584de068d94be35ecb7ae0905b5b016","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-10159","sha":"2c6bf0f1c584de068d94be35ecb7ae0905b5b016","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"71e5a88fc1014a3e3cf1de44578603099a76c421","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

deploy user instance wizard, where there is no choice to choose zone and ISO or template to deploy the user instance from.\r\n\r\nThe new icon is placed as an operation over each VM snapshot object.\r\nClicking this icon will show the wizard to deploy user instance, which is same as the wizard for normal user instance except that zone selection page and ISO/template selection page would not be present in this wizard.\r\n\r\nIt supports only in the case of VMware.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\nMaintained indentation in storage.js\r\nAdded the dictionary values according to google translator.\r\n\r\nThis PR is dependent on parent PR #1664.\r\nReference PR: #1320
