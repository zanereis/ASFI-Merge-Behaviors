SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is hopefully the final `mypy` PR for now providing a spit-and-polish pass which:\r\n\r\n1. Warns on any unused `# type: ignore` statements via the `warn_unused_ignores = true` option. This option seems like a valuable way of ensuring we remove obsolete ignore comments as `mypy` logic and typing of third-party libraries continues to evolve.\r\n\r\n2. Adds more specific typing to previously loosely `Dict`, `Callable`, `List`, `Tuple`, etc. types via the `disallow_any_generics = true` option. This ensures we have somewhat consistent typing throughout (though we still allow `Any`). Note for `Callable` often it was non-trivial for me to determine the args and return type so for these circumstances I opted for `Callable[..., Any]`.\r\n\r\n3. Applies enforcement to the `superset` module. Previously this was also the case but this was spelt out via enumerating all the existing modules due to the nature of the iterative type enforcement.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes the last remaining components that were solely relying on the legacy `explore_json` endpoint, and removes Word Cloud from `viz.py`. Some other minor changes/improvements:\r\n- Add support for domain sharding to v1 chart data requests\r\n- Add `dashboard_id` to v1 chart data request url parameters to comply with legacy request signature\r\n\r\nFrom an end user perspective the only visible change is the export JSON functionality, which now returns an array of results for v1 charts as opposed to a single result.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently filter_box's setting **instant_filtering** is set to true by default.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes the bug where users are not able to create new options in FilterBox select. This was because of a typo while migrating `react-select` (#9628).\r\n\r\nI also fixed a UX issue where keep typing backspaces in an empty select loses focus. `react-select` fires `onChange` event in this case, which causes excessive rerenders.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nShould allow create new options:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/83193945-b2c1e900-a0ec-11ea-9f05-7880958f064b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nAdded a Cypress test\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdding the `mypy` type enforcement for the remainder of the `superset.views` module. Note this PR is somewhat hairier that the previous versions, in part because of the brittle nature of many of the base views. \r\n\r\nNote there were many views which were using the `request.args.get(...)` pattern meaning the result was of type `Optional[Any]` which would actually throw an exception if the result was `None` for functions like `json.loads(...)`. Given that these functions aren't throwing I opted to use `request.args[...]` where possible as there seems to be an implicit definition that these values are always defined. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nWhile debugging a unit test I noticed we're on an ancient version of [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/) (4.5.0, released over 2 years ago). To make sure the problem isn't related to the old version of the library, I bumped sinon to the latest stable (9.0.2, released 2 months ago) and fixed [breaking changes](https://sinonjs.org/guides/migrating-to-5.0.html) caused by renaming of `spy.reset()` to `spy.resetHistory()` .\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nThe `annotation_json` API makes use of the TableViz to structure the data returned from it. However, in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9122, we started limiting the columns that were returned, breaking this API. No one caught it because annotations were broken for a variety of other reasons, but I believe that this change should resolve all annotation layer issues remaining\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently only the legacy chart data endpoint is supported for the following operations:\r\n- View Query\r\n- View Raw Results\r\n- View Samples\r\n- Export CSV\r\n\r\nThis PR hides the legacy/non-legacy chart data request logic behind a single function \r\n`getChartDataRequest`, which determines whether the legacy `/superset/explore_json` or new `/api/v1/chart/data` endpoint should be used, and adds support for requesting samples, raw json results, CSV and SQL Query to `QueryContext`.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + local testing\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

But recently I found: when a filter is applied, chart not applying the filter value, but still get refreshed/reloaded.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is very confusing: user is not sure if filter applied to the chart. Since filter's value didn't add onto the chart, this refresh is not necessary at all.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![hx65Zyzf8s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/82719852-26827280-9c63-11ea-8353-02fdd2e79fc0.gif)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n![FFho6a2tK5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/82719856-2f734400-9c63-11ea-8b6a-4bf4d3f7a216.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn airbnb Presto query resources are limited per user. When dashboard has auto force refresh settings, it might not actually improve freshness if the underlying data entities are much longer than the force refresh frequency. The unnecessary force refresh also take dashboard visitors' query resource quota.\r\n\r\nThis feature is to add notification and warnings if dashboard has auto force refresh settings:\r\n\r\n- Add configuration for **_minimal refresh frequency_**, and the _**warning message**_ text. When dashboard viewer or owner set an **auto force refresh frequency < minimal refresh frequency**, will show warning message in the Refresh Interval Modal.\r\n\r\n- Set auto refresh frequency in dashboard view mode only affect current visit. **Close or refresh browser this change will be gone**:\r\n![TDWxtxEl4i](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/83385417-10c92780-a39e-11ea-961b-2fc0ed24132d.gif)\r\n\r\n- Set auto refresh frequency in dashboard edit mode will be saved

mode will **not** be saved to backend.\r\n\r\n- When a user is viewing a dashboard with auto force refresh settings, when the force refresh is triggered, a toast message will show up.\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\ncloses https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8871\r\n\r\nWhen constraints names aren't defined in sqlalchemy/alembic, they are non-deterministic, and it makes it hard/impossible to delete them in subsequent migrations. Here a bad constraint was created originally without a name, and some other migration tries to re-create it, and may fail on a subset of database engines. Also I think sqlite doesn't support constraint making the whole thing more of a headache.\r\n\r\nI decided to go back to the first migration and prevent the constraint to be created in the first place. Try to delete the constraint in the subsequent migrations, and finally create the appropriate one.\r\n\r\nTODO: We should squash [at least a subset of] migrations eventually.","created_at":"2020-05-22T04:04:26Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T20:50:39Z","closed_at":"2020-10-10T06:21:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ea60a9aa8253400071637a4a67b10f9aa795a5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/9882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/9882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/69833db2a65a3a43abe56601a90d75c12f8f8433","head":{"label":"mistercrunch:fix_old_unique_constraint","ref":"fix_old_unique_constraint","sha":"69833db2a65a3a43abe56601a90d75c12f8f8433","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56703070,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjcwMzA3MA==","name":"superset","full_name":"mistercrunch/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch/superset","description":"Caravel

SUMMARY\r\nOn BigQuery, some WHERE clauses on nested fields of RECORD type columns were failing due to aliases being added to all columns in the WHERE clause. This is in violation of the BigQuery spec, but also more generally inconsistent with the ANSI SQL spec:\r\n> You cannot reference column aliases from the SELECT list in the WHERE clause.\r\n\r\nSource: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#where_clause\r\n\r\n> Standard SQL disallows references to column aliases in a WHERE clause. This restriction is imposed because when the WHERE clause is evaluated, the column value may not yet have been determined.\r\n\r\nSource: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/problems-with-alias.html\r\n\r\nWhile the BigQuery SqlAlchemy dialect should ignore the aliases automatically (see the linked issue and PR on `pybigquery`), this PR disables aliasing in WHERE clauses **for all engines**, and fixes the immediate problem for BigQuery. I propose getting this merged ASAP to fix the observed BigQuery bug, but recommend adding unit tests later for this as we add proper tests for officially supported database engines.\r\n\r\nLinks to

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn order to start moving things more toward using CSS-in-JS (with Emotion) this PR adds ThemeProviders to all of the React apps in the codebase. Maybe one day we can whittle down the number of these apps, but for now, they should all work the same, so I'm just propagating the pattern here.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the Explore and Dashboard apps _will_ need it, so the theme can be used in viz plugins reliably. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR disables `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` which seem to be problematic when forward reference type checking is used even when applying the [recommendations](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/) for circular imports. \r\n\r\nIt seems for https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9824 which required `set_type_checking_flag = True` there were problems with Flask-Login and the LocalProxy in addition to the requirements added in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9833. Furthermore there seems to be a number of open [issues](https://github.com/agronholm/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/issues) with the package, and thus I wondered if there was merit in disabling this until we have Python 3.7 as the minimum version when we can leverage [postponed evaluations and annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#pep-563-postponed-evaluation-of-annotations).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue which surfaced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9824 with Sphinx when an auto-doc included a forward reference via `TYPE_CHECKING`. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to `set_type_checking_flag = True` in the Sphinx configuration however this raised additional warnings such as `cannot import name 'ArrayLike'` and `cannot import name 'security_manager'`. \r\n\r\nAfter a decent amount of Googling it's uncertain what the root cause is, but it seems importing these modules into `docs/conf.py` resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nRemoving logic to add the timeseries_limit_metric to data for Table viz. This was previously necessary in the old Table viz to fix a bug where labeled metrics with a sortby wouldn't show up. This is no longer necessary in the new Table viz and causes an extra column to show up on the table.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTesting table viz with and without sortby, with and without labeled metrics.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThe `getExploreUrlAndPayload` function is currently unnecessarily complex and returns an unmutated copy of one of its inputs (`formData`). Also, the `getURIDirectory` signature included `formData` which was never used. This PR simplifies the function signatures with the ultimate aim of breaking up the functions into smaller more specific functions.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing + CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is to fix 2 issues in **single value** filter_box.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\n1.

Issue 1: When user clear filter_box, the option value should be null. While when filter_box value is undefined, should use defaultValue.\r\n2. Issue 2: When user update defaultValue for filter_box, add type cast for numeric and boolean type column.\r\n \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @ktmud @etr2460

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdding `mypy` type enforcement to the `superset.connectors` module.\r\n\r\nNote this PR was much more involved/complex than I had originally thought given the dependency on other modules which were untyped. Additionally the overall code quality is quite poor; large complex functions, numerous variables which were either optional or with mixed types (`Union`), variable redefinition, etc. meant that the logic was quite hard to grok.\r\n\r\nNote this PR may introduce some regressions due to the necessary restructuring, however I sense long-term benefits of having the entire repo typed outweighs the short-term concerns regarding possibly (minor) regressions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently in explore view, inline edit chart title will overwrite original chart data without confirmation. This behavior is very confusing: \r\n1. user open a chart\r\n2. as long as the user is chart owner, user can click the chart title, and inline edit chart title. When user is done with editing, Superset will automatically save new chart title in the database (overwrite original chart title), without user clicking a confirm button. User may not realize the original chart title is overwritten.\r\n3. if user wants to make a copy of the original chart, they may edit title first then click Save button and choose \"Save as\". But at this moment the original title is already changed.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\n1. user can still inline edit chart title, but Superset won't overwrite chart title right away. The changes is only in front-end, not change backend slice data.\r\n2. Only when user click explore view's Save button, and choose save as or overwrite, the new title will be saved with other changes. If user choose save as, original chart title won't be updated.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @etr2460

`flask_jwt_extended/view_decorators.py` in `_decode_jwt_from_request` at `line 312` has ` raise NoAuthorizationError(err_msg)`. Sentry reports `NoAuthorizationError` expectedly but this error is not an actual crash.  We want filter error out to reduce noise.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nLast week fossa command became flaky and failed to install. This blocked PRs from passing build and merging. A PR to fix this was opened (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9769) but it didn't fix it. Eventually fossa started working again. This PR introduces a check for the fossa command and logs, but does not fail the build, if the fossa command cannot be found.  \r\n\r\nHow important is it to have the fossa check? I haven't had much experience with it, is it actively monitored. Should we fail the build if a fossa report cannot be generated? \r\n\r\nIf the fossa check is absolutely necessary, can we only run it when dependency files change, eg requirements*.txt, package*.json?  \r\n\r\n#### UPDATE FROM DISCUSSION\r\nThis PR checks for changes to dependency files (\\*.package\\*\\.json and \\*.requirements\\*\\.json) and runs fossa *only* if those files have changed. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- [x] build passes\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nException messages are frequently bubbled up to error aggregators like Sentry, Airbrake, and the like from web applications. As queries can fail for a wide variety of reasons, most of which are beyond the ability of Superset to catch and fix before execution, I'd like to downgrade the messaging around analytical query failures to the warning level. This will keep the events in log streams but largely remove them from error aggregators.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST
