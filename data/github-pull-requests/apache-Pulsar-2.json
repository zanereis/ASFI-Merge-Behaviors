https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23790\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Pulsar supports blue-green cluster migration at both the cluster and namespace levels, but the `migratedClusterUrl` can only be set at the cluster level, meaning that migration can only occur to a single cluster. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are times when we want to migrate different namespaces to different clusters. For example, a certain namespace belongs to a specific business and is currently in a public cluster. We want to migrate this namespace to a dedicated cluster for that business. Therefore, we would like to add the `migratedClusterUrl` configuration at the namespace level to support this functionality\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAllow specifying `migratedClusterUrl` at the namespace level.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nAdd test in: `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ClusterMigrationTest#testNamespaceMigrationWithNamespaceLevelMigratedClusterUrl`\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #23705 \r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn the code, the asynchronous function is not handled properly. `stats.processTimeEnd()` is called immediately when the result is returned, but we should wait for the asynchronous task to complete before processing.\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nPassed `stats` as a parameter into the function, and called `stats.processTimeEnd()` after the function call completes. Also, updated the corresponding test cases.\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nThe number of partitions for creating system topics depends on the value of the \"defaultNumPartitions\" configuration field, but this field is also the number of partitions for automatically creating topics. If the value of defaultNumPartitions is set to a large value, the system theme partition is also large, causing resource waste.\r\n### Modifications\r\nNew \"systemTopicDefaultNumPartitions\" configuration field, isolation system topic creation and automatically create topic for \"defaultNumPartitions\" fields of mutual dependence. When metadata is mounted, the system topic and common topic depend on the default partition configuration parameters\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nMake the reader referenced by SystemTopicBasedTopicPoliciesService pooling messages to reduce GC pressure.\r\n\r\nIf `poolMessage=false` of the Reader, pulsar client will copy message payload into heap without pooling. \r\nGenerally, it is not recommended  to users use the feature, because it requires call `message.release()` manually, or it will lead to mem leak.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the broker side, we need this feature to improve JVM GC performance. \r\nEspecially for there is a big number of topics served by a single broker.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Make `poolMessage=true` when SystemTopicBasedTopicPoliciesService component creating a reader\r\n2. Call `message.release()` manually after process messages.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nMake the reader referenced by TransactionBuffer pooling messages to reduce GC pressure.\r\n\r\nIf `poolMessage=false` of the Reader, pulsar client will copy message payload into heap without pooling. \r\nGenerally, it is not recommended  to users use the feature, because it requires call `message.release()` manually, or it will lead to mem leak.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the broker side, we need this feature to improve JVM GC performance. \r\nEspecially for there is a big number of topics served by a single broker.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Make `poolMessage=true` when TopicTransactionBuffer component creating a reader\r\n2.

Therefore, a new method `long getHashCode(String name)`  is added to the `TopicBundleAssignmentStrategy` interface class. The implementation of the hash algorithm is no longer fixed in the `NamespaceBundleFactory#getLongHashCode` method. Instead, the `getHashCode` method implemented by different algorithms is invoked.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [X] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *TopicBundleAssignmentStrategyTest#testStrategyFactory*, and added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*TopicBundleAssignmentStrategyTest*\r\n  - *TopicBundleAssignmentStrategyTest#testRoundRobinBundleAssigner：A new partition assignment strategy algorithm `RoundRobinBundleAssigner` is customized and the `TopicBundleAssignmentStrategy` interface is implemented. Only the interfaces in `TopicBundleAssignmentStrategy` need to be implemented. It's not needed to modify the interface implementation of other classes. The open and closed principles are met.*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nThere is a mechanism that repeatedly prevents the callback of ML data ledger creation:\r\n- Start a scheduled task to check whether the creation will be timeout.\r\n- Received a callback\r\n  - Check whether the future(`@param ctx` of `BK.createAsync`) has been done or not.\r\n  - If done: it means the creation has timeout before the creation is completed\r\n  - Otherwise: it is a real callback from BK.\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\nBut the timeout event will call the same callback as above, then the steps are as follows, which you ca reproduce by the test `testCreateDataLedgerTimeout`:\r\n- Start creating a data ledger\r\n  - Call `BK.createAsync` \r\n- Timeout\r\n  - Mark the future(`@param ctx` of `BK.createAsync`) as completed exceptionally. \r\n  - Trigger the callback related to ledger creation. \r\n    - Check whether the future(`@param ctx` of `BK.createAsync`) has been done or not.\r\n    - If done: do nothing.\r\n- Creation is compelled.\r\n  - Trigger the callback related to ledger creation. \r\n    - Check whether the future(`@param ctx` of `BK.createAsync`) has been done or not.\r\n    - If done: do nothing.\r\n- Issue: The callback for ledger creation will never be called.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-24 at 00 14 38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44ed19d2-7238-45a4-9186-c127f6ed14f7)\r\n![Screenshot

At the same time, the business needs to modify the code online in order to replicate the subscription status, which makes our migration efficiency heavily dependent on the business.\r\nFor this scenario, we expect to have a global control switch for subscription state replication on the server, which can be enabled to replicate all subscription state information in the cluster without the need for business code modification.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a switch on the broker side to replicate all subscription states from the source cluster to the target cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21367 introduced the `migrated` field in `localPolicies` to indicate whether the topics under a namespace have been migrated in the blue-green cluster migration feature.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9598, it is specified that when updating the field content of `localPolicies`, a new object needs to be created instead of updating the original object.\r\n\r\nAfter the addition of the `migrated` field in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21367, there has been no synchronization of modifications in other places that update `localPolicies`. This could lead to the loss of the `migrated` content during other operations on `localPolicies`, such as setting the `namespaceAntiAffinityGroup`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Synchronize the `migrated` content in the places where `localPolicies` are updated\r\n2. When updating the `migrated` field of `localPolicies`, do not modify the original object\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added test in: org.apache.pulsar.broker.admin.NamespacesTest#testMigratedInfoIsNotLostDuringOtherLocalPoliciesUpdate\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23717 #23306\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe Pulsar Alpine docker image has stability issues due to including [glibc-package solution](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/tree/e535d990f60b5c15f1ec440e82de2fa80d6783a5/docker/glibc-package) which includes glibc library into the Alpine docker image. \r\n\r\nThe stability issue causes JVM crashes. This happens mainly in Netty native library loading and usage. It's also a problem in other native libraries such as Conscrypt (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23364#issuecomment-2380635032) and Snappy (#22804). There are also Netty stability issues causing JVM crashes which could be caused by problems in native code (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23612#issuecomment-2486427211).\r\n\r\nAlpine maintainers don't recommend adding glibc to Alpine since mixing real glibc in Alpine will result in an unstable environment. In Alpine maintainer [Ariadne Conill's words](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/24647#note_176723): _\"Combining glibc and musl runtimes is basically all but guaranteed to create an unstable environment, unless the system is appropriately configured (glibc side uses glibc binaries only, and vice versa).\"_\r\n\r\n* blog post by Ariadne Conill, [there is no such thing as a \"glibc based alpine image\"](https://ariadne.space/2021/08/26/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-glibc-based-alpine-image/)\r\n* comments explaining reasons:\r\n  * https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/10779#issuecomment-906095981\r\n  * https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/10779#issuecomment-906240756\r\n  * https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/24647#note_176723\r\n\r\nThe reason why the glibc solution was initially added was to support Pulsar IO Kinesis connector. The Amazon Kinesis Producer Library isn't fully Java. The Java API calls a native executable which is built for glibc. Amazon doesn't provide a binary for Alpine, however the native executable source code is provided. In order to use Amazon Kinesis Producer Library on Alpine, the stable solution is to compile this binary specifically for Alpine.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n[Mailing list thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/20q08xr1d9l8rlovjmsgwcxn2sfodvp9)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis PR includes changes to:\r\n- remove the glibc-package solution\r\n- provide a Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) executable compiled for Alpine\r\n  - There's a Dockerfile that downloads and compiles KPL 0.15.12 version for Alpine.\r\n    - The resulting docker image has been published to [`apachepulsar/pulsar-io-kinesis-sink-kinesis_producer:0.15.12`](https://hub.docker.com/r/apachepulsar/pulsar-io-kinesis-sink-kinesis_producer/tags). \r\n      - This will need to be updated only when Kinesis Producer Library is upgraded within Pulsar. \r\n  - Changes to build on Alpine have been submitted as a PR to Amazon Kinesis Producer Library so that Amazon would hopefully start supporting Alpine directly in the future: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/pull/620 \r\n- The `kinesis_producer` executable is copied from  `apachepulsar/pulsar-io-kinesis-sink-kinesis_producer:0.15.12` image to the `apachepulsar/pulsar-all` image and an environment variable `PULSAR_IO_KINESIS_KPL_PATH` is set to the executable path.\r\n- Amazon Kinesis Producer Library has been upgraded from 0.14.13 version to 0.15.12. \r\n  - The 0.14.13 contains several critical issues such as a potential data loss issue\r\n  - In 0.15.12, the implementation uses AWS STS (Security Token Service) under the covers. \r\n    - It is necessary to update the unit and integration tests Localstack configuration to include STS support and overriding the endpoints in the Pulsar IO Kinesis Sink connector\r\n- The Pulsar IO Kinesis Sink connector has been modified to support the AWS Kinesis Producer Library parameter `nativeExecutable`. When the  `PULSAR_IO_KINESIS_KPL_PATH` env var is set, it will be set to the `nativeExecutable` parameter as the default value. This is how the Pulsar IO Kinesis Sink connector will use the `kinesis_producer` binary compiled for Alpine when using the `pulsar-all` image.\r\n\r\n- In the Pulsar docker image, `LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libgcompat.so.0` is set. This is required to support loading Netty native libraries in Alpine unless the JVM already loads the `gcompat` library which provides a `glibc` compatibility layer for Alpine. The Alpine `gcompat` library is the recommended option for Netty native libraries on Alpine.\r\n  - More details in comments: \r\n    - https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10096#issuecomment-1608134469\r\n    - https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/issues/907#issuecomment-2548228536 \r\n    - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23717#issuecomment-2548242000\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn the current process of closeAsync() in ProducerImpl.java, the client will firstly set the producer to the Closing state, then stop timerTask of sendTimeout, and then send a http request to broker to close the producer. When the client receives a successful response from broker, it sets the producer to the Closed state, removes the producer from the producers in client, and complete the PendingMessage with AlreadyClosedException.\r\nHowever, if the communication between client and broker is abnormal due to network or other reasons, the PendingMessage will not be cleared anymore. What's worse is that since the producer is already in the Closing state at this time, there is no chance to trigger the cleanup of PendingMessage by calling the closeAsync() again, which is obviously unreasonable.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThere is no need to wait for the broker's response to clean up PendingMessage. Once you decide to shut down the producer, there is no need to retain the PendingMessage in the producer. At this time, failing quickly is more valuable than waiting.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nAdd a test case to ensure closeAndClearPendingMessages() has been invoke when request broker error after closeAsync().\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292 introduced a new serialization about cursor metadata, but it will be lost. information when switching the config  `unackedRangesOpenCacheSetEnabled`. You can reproduce the issue with the new test `testUnackmessagesAndRecoveryCompatibility`\r\n- [[DISCUSS] Add an optional config to disable the feature that compresses cursor metadata, which was contributed by #9292](https://lists.apache.org/thread/kfm7n6xf9pf7h76k4gx83zv3c2kj6yy1)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- Fix the issue\r\n- Add an optional config `managedLedgerPersistIndividualAckAsLongArray` to enable or disable the feature that https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9292 introduced, and set the default value to `false`. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of subscription replication relies on consumer control with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean replicateSubscriptionState = false;\r\n// boolean replicateSubscriptionState = true;\r\npulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)\r\n                .replicateSubscriptionState(replicateSubscriptionState)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the `replicateSubscriptionState` is set to `false` in the `ConsumerConfigurationData.java`, which creates a mismatch with the `CommandSubscribe` definition, where `replicate_subscription_state` is optional. To address this, I propose changing the default value of `replicateSubscriptionState` to `null`, aligning it with the optional nature of the field in `CommandSubscribe`.\r\n\r\nThis adjustment would enhance flexibility in managing subscription replication policies, such as applying the policy that comes from the namespace or topic level, which streamlines the configuration of subscription replication behavior. This feature is in progress.\r\n\r\nThese changes are compatible with both the old and new versions, there won't be any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- The `replicateSubscriptionState` type is changed from `boolean` to `Boolean` and the default value is `null` in the`ConsumerConfigurationData.java`. When it is null, it won't set the value to the `replicate_subscription_state` of `CommandSubscribe`.\r\n- In the broker, use the `Boolean` instead of `boolean` to match the `replicate_subscription_state` of `CommandSubscribe`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- The log messages are verbose when `PulsarClientException.AlreadyClosedException` is returned from `closeAsync`. \r\n  - Don't log the AlreadyClosedException stack trace\r\n- There are concerns that producers could be left in the cache in exceptional cases. Therefore add handling to handle possible runtime exceptions in `flushAsync` and `closeAsync` calls.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- improve ProducerCache logic\r\n- add tests\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nSee CVE-2024-53990. There aren't backend services in Pulsar that would use cookies, however since it's a high severity vulnerability, there's a need to mitigate it. Eventually we will need to upgrade to AsyncHttpClient 3.0.1 to get rid of the vulnerable dependency AsyncHttpClient 2.12.x.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- As a mitigation, disable CookieStore by setting it to null \r\n- This PR doesn't upgrade to AsyncHttpClient 3.0.1\r\n  - Upgrading to AsyncHttpClient 3.0.1 will be more work. It will be handled separately.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n- dev mailing list thread:\r\n  - [[DISCUSS] Strategy for addressing AsyncHttpClient CVE-2024-53990 in Pulsar Java clients while maintaining Java 8 compatibility](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fpg465pxytqkxbs57h7p3mckn9dwh3zq)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nThe steps for checking backlog metadata are as follows\r\n- Get the oldest cursor\r\n- Return the result if the oldest `cursor.md` equals LAC\r\n- Else, calculate the estimated backlog quota\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\n- The method `PersistentTopic.estimatedTimeBasedBacklogQuotaCheck` may get an NPE when the `@param position(cursor.markDeletedPositon)` equals LAC and the latest ledger has been removed by a `ML.trimLedgers`, which was introduced by https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21816\r\n- Q: The broker checked whether the oldest `cursor.md` equals LAC at step 2 above, why does it still call `PersistentTopic.estimatedTimeBasedBacklogQuotaCheck` with a param that equals `LAC`?\r\n  - A: There may be some `acknowledgments` and `ML.trimLedgers` that happened between `step2 above and step 3` above\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Fix NPE, and let the logic is the same as the behavior before

#23704 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWe use the pulsar client to consume messages from a Pulsar broker in a Storm topology. Recently, we encountered an issue where the `deadLetterPolicy` that we set on the `PulsarSpout` seems to be lost when the topology is started. Upon investigation, we found that this is due to the `deadLetterPolicy` attribute in `ConsumerConfigurationData` being marked as transient. This prevents us from utilising the dead letter queue feature in our topology.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nMade DeadLetterPolicy, KeySharedPolicy and Range classes implement the java.io.Serializable interface and removed the transient keyword from the corresponding fields in the ConsumerConfigurationData class. In addition, two tests were also modified / updated.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [X] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Extended existing unit test for the ConsumerConfigurationData class to validate the retention of deadLetterPolicy through serialization & deserialization. \r\n\r\n### Does this pull

PR: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23714\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Pulsar supports blue-green cluster migration at both the cluster level and the namespace level. However, sometimes there are many topics under a single namespace, and we do not want to migrate all topics in that namespace to the green cluster at the same time, as this may introduce risks. Therefore, we would like to introduce topic-level migration functionality to have more granular control over the migration process.\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd an admin API and command for enabling migration at the topic level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Pulsar supports blue-green cluster migration at both the cluster level and the namespace level. However, sometimes there are many topics under a single namespace, and we do not want to migrate all topics in that namespace to the green cluster at the same time, as this may introduce risks. Therefore, we would like to introduce topic-level migration functionality to have more granular control over the migration process.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nAdd an admin API and command for enabling migration at the topic level.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nAdded test in: `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ClusterMigrationTest#testTopicMigration`\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Improve the `testSeekChunkMessages` to verify it.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes. -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact docs and you will update later -->\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed` <!-- Your PR changes do not impact docs -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-complete` <!-- Docs have been already added -->\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository: <!-- ENTER URL HERE -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-11T11:13:59Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T12:26:54Z","closed_at":"2024-12-13T06:38:04Z","merged_at":"2024-12-13T06:38:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"4606385f4e30392119b813326d493245a3504aac","assignee":{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Technoboy-","id":6297296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTcyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6297296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-","html_url":"https://github.com/Technoboy-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Technoboy-/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_ur

#23789 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThere is already one metric called `pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes` for the total memory occupation used by delayed queue of **one topic**. \r\n```\r\nwriteMetric(stream, \"pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes\", stats.delayedTrackerMemoryUsage,\r\n                cluster, namespace, topic, splitTopicAndPartitionIndexLabel);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas, the metric for **one sub** also called `pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes`, which do not comform the metric name norm and is confusing.\r\n```\r\nwriteSubscriptionMetric(stream, \"pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes\",\r\n                    subsStats.delayedTrackerMemoryUsage, cluster, namespace, topic, sub, splitTopicAndPartitionIndexLabel);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, it can export metric like:\r\n```\r\n# TYPE pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes gauge\r\npulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes{cluster=\"MyPulsar\",namespace=\"public/default\",topic=\"persistent://public/default/testNack-partition-0\"} 0\r\npulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes{cluster=\"MyPulsar\",namespace=\"public/default\",topic=\"persistent://public/default/testNack-partition-0\",subscription=\"sub2\"} 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe metric of topic and subscription mix together. If we want to filter out the metric of sub to pick out the metric of topic, we need to use promsql like: \r\n`pulsar_delayed_message_index_size_bytes{subscription=\"\"}`\r\nIt is quite weird and i believe that if any user use it already, he/she will contribute a pr to fix this, as these label names can only be access by researching the code, which means he/she is an advanced user and is involved in the community probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nRename the metric for **one sub** to `pulsar_subscription_delayed_message_index_size_bytes`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using asynchronous functions in Pulsar Functions, concurrency needs to be limited to prevent unbounded resource consumption. This is currently handled by the `maxPendingAsyncRequests` configuration parameter (default value: 1000). Without such limits, asynchronous processing could lead to unbounded message consumption from input topics, potentially causing resource exhaustion (out-of-memory errors) and function crashes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation has a performance issue specifically for asynchronous functions that return `CompletableFuture<Void>`. In these cases, the current queue-based implementation introduces unnecessary processing delays when the concurrency limit is reached. In particular:\r\n\r\n1. When there's a slow response at the head of the queue, request processing gets delayed unnecessarily when the queue is full. This makes the actual concurrency limit lower than the configured limit and it becomes nondeterministic. Under heavy load, the concurrency limit will be introducing backpressure and this is why any slow request will cause an unnecessary additional latency to the messages in the backlog. This could lead to additional cumulative latency for backlogged messages since all previous delays impact the processing latency of later messages. This type of latency is avoidable with the solution explained in this PR.\r\n2. This introduces avoidable latency for functions using `Context.newOutputMessage(...).sendAsync()` to send messages to multiple topics\r\n3. The current queue-based ordering preservation is unnecessary when no results are being returned (when return type is `CompletableFuture<Void>`)\r\n\r\n## Modifications\r\nThis PR improves the implementation by:\r\n\r\n1. Using a `Semaphore` instead of `LinkedBlockingQueue` for concurrency limiting when the function's return type is `CompletableFuture<Void>`\r\n2. Preserving the existing queue-based implementation for other return types where output message ordering needs to match input ordering\r\n3. Making exception handling more robust by properly unwrapping completion exceptions\r\n4. Simplifying the `JavaExecutionResult` class by removing unused `systemException` field\r\n5. Adding a unit test to verify the new implementation\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n- Added logic to detect `CompletableFuture<Void>` return type through function configuration\r\n- Introduced a `Semaphore`-based concurrency limiter that gets used when order preservation isn't needed\r\n- Maintained backwards compatibility by keeping queue-based implementation for non-void return types\r\n- Updated error handling to better handle asynchronous exceptions and to avoid the extra wrapping of `Throwable` with `new Exception(t)` type of code.\r\n- Added test coverage for the new concurrency limiting approach\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test `testAsyncFunctionMaxPendingVoidResult()` that verifies:\r\n- Proper concurrency limiting with Semaphore\r\n- Correct handling of async void results\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\n**How does deduplication work?**\r\n- Producer sends messages and records sequence-ids that are pending responses in memory, the variable is `{pendingMessages}`\r\n- Brokers will respond to an invalid position `-1:-1` if the sequence ID published is lower than the previous messages.\r\n- Producer checks whether the next sequence id in `{pendingMessages}` is larger than the one that was rejected.\r\n  - `{next} > {rejected}`: ignore the error, and continue work\r\n  - `{next} < {rejected}`: close channels and reconnect.\r\n\r\nConditions that issue happened\r\n\r\n- Replicators send all messages on a topic and do not matter what message was sent by which original producer.\r\n  - **(Highlight)** it mixed messages into `{pendingMessages}` with `message.sequenceId` but ignores `message.original-producer-name`, which may cause the sequence-ids in `{pendingMessages}` is not increasing\r\n- The producer checking the sequence ID after receiving a `-1:-1` send response will fail.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue-1: loss messages**\r\n\r\n- Publishing in the source cluster\r\n  - Producer-1 send 2 messages: M1(`seq: 0`), M2(`seq: 1`)\r\n  - Producer-2 send 2 messages: M3(`seq: 0`), M4(`seq: 1`)\r\n- Replicate messages to the remote cluster\r\n  - Copies M1 and M2\r\n    - `{pendingMessages}`: `[0,1]`\r\n  - Repeatedly copies M1 and M2. and copies M3 and M4.\r\n    - `{pendingMessages}`: `[0,1,0,1]`\r\n    - After repeatedly copying M1 and M2, the network broke.\r\n    - Receive send receipt:\r\n      - `seq 0, position 0:0`\r\n      - `seq 1, position 0:1`\r\n      - `seq 0, position -1: -1`\r\n      - `seq 1, position -1:-1`\r\n    - `{pendingMessages}`: `[empty]`\r\n- After a topic unloading.\r\n  - The replicator will start after the topic is loaded up(backlog is `0` now).\r\n  - The client will create a new connection.\r\n- Result:\r\n  - Disabled deduplication: copied `[M1, M2, M1, M2]`\r\n  - Enabled deduplication: copied `[M1, M2]`\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the issue by the test `testDeduplicationNotLostMessage`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Issue-2: frequently fails**\r\n- Original-producer-2: sent msg `3:0` with sequence-id `10`\r\n- Original-producer-1: sent msg `3:1` with sequence-id `1`\r\n- Original-producer-1: sent msg `3:2` with sequence-id `2`\r\n-0 Replicator copies messages \r\n  - `{pendingMessages}`: `[10,1, 2]`\r\n- Sent `3:0` successfully\r\n  - `{pendingMessages}`: `[1,2]`\r\n- Resend `3:0`(a duplicated publishing)\r\n  - Receive `-1:-1`(new position relates to the latest publishing) for the latest send-response.\r\n  - `failed-sequenced:10 > pendingMessages[0].sequenceId: 1`\r\n  - Replicator-producer reconnects and resets the cursor, which leads to more duplicated publishing.\r\n  - Loop to the step 1.\r\n\r\nNo test for reproducing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n**Solution: replicators use a specified sequence ID(`ledegrId:entryId` of the original topic) instead of using the original producers’**\r\n- Original-producer-2: sent msg `3:0` with sequence-id `10`\r\n- Original-producer-1: sent msg `3:1` with sequence-id `1`\r\n- Original-producer-1: sent msg `3:2` with sequence-id `2`\r\n- Replicator copies messages with specified sequence ID(`3:0`)\r\n  - `{pendingMessages}`: `3:0, 3:1, 3:2]`\r\n- Sent `3:0` successfully\r\n  - `{pendingMessages}`: `[3:1, 3:2]`\r\n- Resend `3:0`(a duplicated publishing)\r\n- Receive `-1:-1`(new position relates to the latest publishing) for the latest

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe default value of the `connected` field in `org.apache.pulsar.common.policies.data.stats.ReplicatorStatsImpl` is false, and the logic for accumulating each partition (`org.apache.pulsar.common.policies.data.stats.ReplicatorStatsImpl#add`) is `this.connected &= stats.connected;`. This causes the status of a multi-partition topic to always be false after calculation, and it is impossible to truly feedback the correct status of the geo replication task.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nModify the `connected` field in `org.apache.pulsar.common.policies.data.stats.ReplicatorStatsImpl` from false to true.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR

Motivation\r\nWhen the delayed acknowledgment feature is enabled, the method `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.PersistentAcknowledgmentsGroupingTracker#isDuplicate` filters out messages that have already been acknowledged on the client side. \r\n\r\nWhen using the blue-green cluster feature, after switching from the blue cluster to the green cluster, the message IDs generated by the green cluster may be smaller than those from the blue cluster. In this case, if a reader is used for consumption, the method `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.PersistentAcknowledgmentsGroupingTracker#isDuplicate` will filter out all messages with IDs less than or equal to `lastCumulativeAck`, which can result in the loss of messages with IDs less than or equal to `lastCumulativeAck` after switching to the green cluster.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nBefore switching from the blue cluster to the green cluster, first clear the contents of `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.AcknowledgmentsGroupingTracker`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nAdded test in: `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ClusterMigrationTest#testMigrationWithReader`\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nFixes a similar issue as #22150, for `pulsar-admin topics set-retention` and `pulsar-admin topicPolicies set-retention` commands. Related to #23688. This adds a test to #23688 changes.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this bug is that when the value overflows when it's over 2GB. The effective value becomes negative or 0, which disables retention. There won't be a failure. For example, with the parameter `-s 3G`, the value becomes `-1024`. With any value more than 4GB, the value becomes `0`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- use long value instead of integer\r\n- add tests which also cover #23688 change\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `ClientBuilder#memoryLimit` was introduced in [PIP-74][pip-74] and originally affected producers only. In #15216, the memory limit was updated to include consumer memory usage when `ConsumerBuilder#autoScaledReceiverQueueSizeEnabled` is enabled. This patch updates the Javadoc to reflect the actual behavior.\r\n\r\n[pip-74]: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-74%3A-Pulsar-client-memory-limits\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

This issue can be easily reproduced by increasing concurrent futures in the test `MetadataCacheTest#readModifyUpdateBadVersionRetry`.\r\n\r\nThe current retry implementation is incorrect and lacks a backoff mechanism, which could lead to too many requests to the metadata store.\r\n\r\n## Modification\r\n\r\n- Correct the retry process in `MetadataCache#readModifyUpdateOrCreate` to ensure BadVersionException is caught during each retry.\r\n- Implement a retry backoff mechanism in `MetadataCache#readModifyUpdateOrCreate` to manage the frequency of retries effectively.\r\n- Add new config `retryBackoff` to the MetadataCacheConfig to control the MetadataCache retry backoff.\r\n- Respective the `metadataStoreOperationTimeoutSeconds` for the MetadataCache retry\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current behavior does not provide clear visibility when the message size exceeds the configured maximum size, often leading to `InvalidMessageException` error. This change introduces a log statement to notify when the message size exceeds the threshold, helping users identify and troubleshoot message size issues more easily.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdded a `log.warn` statement before releasing the semaphore and throwing the `InvalidMessageException`.\r\nThe log includes details about the message size, the configured threshold, and the producer/topic involved, improving visibility for debugging and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [X] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nI have a broker interceptor, which will add a topic event listener to listen the topic creation in the `org.apache.pulsar.broker.intercept.BrokerInterceptor#initialize`. However, the partitioned topic creation event can not be recorded(`bin/pulsar-admin topics create-partitioned-topic -p 3 test-topic-event`).\r\n\r\n```java\r\npulsar.getBrokerService().addTopicEventListener((topic, event, stage, t) -> {\r\n            log.info(\"got event {}__{} for topic {}\", event, stage, topic);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe non-partitioned topic works fine. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Call `topicEventsDispatcher` with the `TopicEvent.CREATE` and `EventStage.BEFORE` before creating the persistent/non-persistent partitioned topic.\r\n- Call `topicEventsDispatcher` with the `TopicEvent.CREATE` and `EventStage.SUCCESS/FAILURE`  after the persistent/non-persistent partitioned topic is created.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nFix issue: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23673\r\nWe found that sometimes `readPosition` is larger than `lastPosition`. If this happens, messages will not be consumed, messages will be backlogged, and recovery will not be possible.\r\nThe reason for this problem is probably when executing `updateReadPosition` method.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nWhen executing the `updateReadPosition` method, the updated position is not allowed to exceed lastPosition+1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n#23637 introduces a method called `allowTopicPolicyOperationAsync`.

`PulsarAuthorizationProvider`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- The existing test `BrokerEndpointsAuthorizationTest` is already covered. \r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI

#23648 \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPulsar Proxy has a support to use it as HTTP reverse proxy to access Broker’s admin API and can also be extended to act as a reverse proxy other HTTP endpoints. Sometimes, it is very crucial to add customizable headers into the HTTP response returned by Proxy to enhance the security experience while using Proxy over HTTP.\r\n\r\nResponse headers in a reverse HTTP proxy are critical for maintaining and enhancing the security of the web applications and services behind the proxy. These headers act as a first line of defense, hardening the web server infrastructure and protecting clients from common web vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nFor example, when implementing a reverse HTTP proxy, security headers such as `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc., are useful to prevent security attacks like clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, data leakage, and more. So, such headers play a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of proxy infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we would like to add support into Pulsar Proxy where users can add custom response headers by passing them into the configuration. This PIP will add this support by adding a new configuration called `proxyHttpResponseHeadersJson` where user can pass multiple headers with key-value map into the json format. Proxy server will retrieve headers from this configuration and pass it as response headers for every http request when user wants to use Pulsar Proxy as an HTTP reverse proxy.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a new configuration `proxyHttpResponseHeadersJson` to the Proxy configuration.\r\neg:\r\n```\r\nproxyHttpResponseHeadersJson=`{\"header1\":\"value1\",\"header2\":\"value2\"}`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

395\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPulsar Proxy has a support to use it as HTTP reverse proxy to access Broker’s admin API and can also be extended to act as a reverse proxy other HTTP endpoints. Sometimes, it is very crucial to add customizable headers into the HTTP response returned by Proxy to enhance the security experience while using Proxy over HTTP.\r\n\r\nResponse headers in a reverse HTTP proxy are critical for maintaining and enhancing the security of the web applications and services behind the proxy. These headers act as a first line of defense, hardening the web server infrastructure and protecting clients from common web vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nFor example, when implementing a reverse HTTP proxy, security headers such as `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, etc., are useful to prevent security attacks like clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, data leakage, and more. So, such headers play a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of proxy infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we would like to add support into Pulsar Proxy where users can add custom response headers by passing them into the configuration. This PIP will add this support by adding a new configuration called `proxyHttpResponseHeadersJson` where user can pass multiple headers with key-value map into the json format. Proxy server will retrieve headers from this configuration and pass it as response headers for every http request when user wants to use Pulsar Proxy as an HTTP reverse proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a new configuration `proxyHttpResponseHeadersJson` to the Proxy configuration.\r\neg:\r\n```\r\nproxyHttpResponseHeadersJson=`{\"header1\":\"value1\",\"header2\":\"value2\"}`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few inconsistencies in the shaded Pulsar client dependencies pulsar-client, pulsar-client-admin and pulsar-client-all. There's a problem in using the Pulsar client with Quarkus, related issue is #21297.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis PR makes significant improvements to the shading configuration in Pulsar's Java client modules:\r\n\r\n- Address `javax.annotation` shading (#21297):\r\n  - Replace `javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2` with `jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api:1.3.5`\r\n  - Remove provided `javax.annotation-api` dependency which was added in the past to fix compilation with Java 11.\r\n  - Add exclusions for `javax.annotation-api` in various modules\r\n\r\n- Address `javax.activation` shading:\r\n  - Add proper relocation rules for `javax.activation` and `com.sun.activation` packages\r\n\r\n- Transform multi-release class files:\r\n  - Add proper relocation patterns for `META-INF/versions/` directories\r\n  - Handle versioned class files for jackson, glassfish, yaml and other packages\r\n\r\n- Remove unnecessary files:\r\n  - Add exclusions for META-INF/*.SF, *.DSA, *.RSA files\r\n  - Remove redundant META-INF files including licenses and notices\r\n  - Exclude findbugsExclude.xml and native-image configurations\r\n\r\n- Consistent shading across modules:\r\n  - Add `io.swagger` shading in client-admin and client-all\r\n  - Handle `io.airlift` shading across all modules to prevent split packages\r\n  - Add `commons-compress` shading in client-admin\r\n  - Extend `javax.ws.rs` shading to pulsar-client module\r\n\r\n### 1. Dependency Management\r\n\r\n- Reduces unshaded dependencies:\r\n  - Adds missing inclusions for transitive dependencies\r\n  - Ensures all required dependencies are properly shaded\r\n  - Consolidates dependency declarations across modules\r\n\r\n- Jakarta migration:\r\n  - Replaces javax.ws.rs-api with jakarta.ws.rs-api (2.1.6)\r\n  - Updates to jakarta.annotation-api\r\n  - Migrates to jakarta.xml.bind-api\r\n  - Updates related license files and dependency declarations\r\n\r\n- Split package handling:\r\n  - Ensures consistent package relocation across modules\r\n  - Addresses split package issues with io.airlift\r\n  - Fixes overlapping class definitions\r\n\r\n### 2. Multi-Release JAR Support\r\n\r\n- Class file transformation:\r\n  - Adds proper relocation patterns for versioned class files\r\n  - Handles META-INF/versions/{version} directories\r\n  - Supports Java 9+ versioned class files\r\n\r\n- Manifest configuration:\r\n  - Adds Multi-Release: true manifest entry\r\n  - Configures ManifestResourceTransformer\r\n  - Preserves version-specific behavior\r\n\r\n### 3. Build Optimization\r\n\r\n- META-INF cleanup:\r\n  - Removes redundant license files\r\n  - Excludes unnecessary metadata files\r\n  - Handles version-specific information correctly\r\n\r\n- Module system compatibility:\r\n  - Excludes module-info.class files\r\n  - Removes JPMS-related metadata\r\n  - Maintains compatibility with both modular and non-modular environments\r\n\r\n### 4. Service Provider Configuration\r\n\r\n- Service provider handling:\r\n  - Adds proper service files for ClientBuilder\r\n  - Configures RuntimeDelegate service provider\r\n  - Uses correct shaded package names in service files\r\n\r\n- License header requirements:\r\n  - Excludes service files from license checks\r\n  - Updates RAT plugin configuration\r\n  - Maintains compliance while reducing false positives\r\n\r\n### 5. General Improvements\r\n\r\n- Configuration organization:\r\n  - Sorts shade patterns alphabetically [using custom python script](https://gist.github.com/lhotari/e4d1a411bc3a134b0e561cadc3ec5cb5).\r\n  - Groups related configurations together\r\n  - Improves readability and maintainability\r\n\r\n- Standardization:\r\n  - Uses consistent naming patterns\r\n  - Aligns configuration across modules\r\n  - Reduces duplication in shade rules\r\n\r\nThese changes improve the reliability and maintainability of Pulsar's shaded client artifacts while reducing potential conflicts in downstream applications.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

It should be removed.\r\nThis is one of changes required to remove `javax` dependencies from the shaded Pulsar client, related to #21297.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- move RestException and PoliciesUtil to pulsar-broker-common since they are the classes that depend on javax.ws.rs-api and they aren't needed in client side code.\r\n- move defaultBundle method to BundlesData\r\n- remove unnecessary `javax.ws.rs-api` dependency from `pulsar-common` module\r\n- remove unnecessary `javax.ws.rs-api` dependency from `pulsar-client-auth-sasl` module\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Issue:  https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-go/issues/1297\r\nRelative #23577\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAccording to https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23577#discussion_r1858851274, currently `NameUtil#generateRandomName()` is only used in just few cases. Maybe we could use `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils#randomAlphanumeric(int)` to replace this class for better readability and code structure.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nBased on https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23577#discussion_r1855755815 intention:\r\nRemove `NameUtil` completely and use Commons Lang3's `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils#randomAlphanumeric(int)` method with the parameter 5 to create a random string of 5 characters. \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: \r\n`org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.ConsumerImplTest#testAutoGenerateConsumerName`\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [x] **The default values of configurations**\r\nDefault consumer name generating rule will be changed from `[a-f0-9]{5}` to `[a-zA-Z0-9]{5}`.\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes. -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact docs and you will update later -->\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed` <!-- Your PR changes do not impact docs -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-complete` <!-- Docs have been already added -->\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository: <!-- ENTER URL HERE -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-27T12:13:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T11:53:44Z","closed_at":"2024-11-29T02:59:20Z","merged_at":"2024-11-29T02:59:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"32b3ccfd331a1a6093aff80b78512dfd0809992f","assignee":{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"geniusjoe","id":37236056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe","html_url":"https://github.com/geniusjoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geniusjoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

Motivation\r\n\r\nFrom v2.8.0( https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8831 ) , SecurityUtility#createAutoRefreshSslContextForClient was introduced. This method loads a single certification rather than a certification **chain** from cert file.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the PulsarAdmin does not send cert chain in TLS authentication.\r\n\r\n(From v4.0.0 ( https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23110 ), this issue was fixed because the PulsarAdmin does not use this method by default.)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Fix to add certs to KeyStore in KeyManagerProxy\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* Add simple unit tests to check if KeyManagerProxy can load a cert chain\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

`PulsarService.start()` as bellow\r\n  - call `startNamespaceService()`: this line created the object `OwnershipCache`, but the variable `OwnershipCache.selfOwnerInfo` will be set an empty value due to `PulsarService.brokerServiceUrl` has not been initialized yet.\r\n  - Initialize `PulsarService.brokerServiceUrl`.\r\n  - start leader election service and load manager, at this moment the variable `OwnershipCache.selfOwnerInfo` is still empty, so the client may get a null response\r\n  - call `nsService.initialize()`: reset the variable of `OwnershipCache.selfOwnerInfo`.\r\n\r\n**Error

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the latest release candidates (`3.0.8-candidate-1`, `4.0.1-candidate-1`), the jetcd-core-shaded module [shading issue][1] persists. This occurs because the `maven-shade-plugin` [includes][4] the current project artifact in the shade process. In `jetcd-core-shaded`, we copy `io.etcd.jetcd.*` into the `jetcd-core-shaded` jar without relocation. As a result, when the `install` or `deploy` goals are executed without cleaning the `target` folder, class conflicts arise between `io.etcd.jetcd.*` inside `org.apache.pulsar:jetcd-core-shaded.jar` and `io.etcd:jetcd-core.jar`.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23513#issuecomment-2469496334\r\n\r\n#23604 attempted to resolve this issue but failed to account for [build][2] and [deploy][3] in separate steps during the release process. \r\n\r\n[2]: https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/release-process/#build-release-artifacts  \r\n[3]: https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/release-process/#stage-maven-modules\r\n[4]: https://github.com/apache/maven-shade-plugin/blob/maven-shade-plugin-3.4.1/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugins/shade/mojo/ShadeMojo.java#L437\r\n\r\n### Verifying this Change\r\n\r\nTo verify this patch, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Step 1: Clean and install the `jetcd-core-shaded` module.\r\nmvn clean install -pl jetcd-core-shaded -DskipTests\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Install without cleaning, simulating a release process.\r\nmvn install -pl jetcd-core-shaded -DskipTests\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Unpack the shaded jar into a directory and verify imports.\r\n# Ensure that the import statement for `io.netty.handler.logging.ByteBufFormat` \r\n# in `org/apache/pulsar/jetcd/shaded/io/vertx/core/net/NetClientOptions.class` \r\n# is correct. The expected import is:\r\n# `import io.grpc.netty.shaded.io.netty.handler.logging.ByteBufFormat;`.\r\nunzip $M2_REPO/org/apache/pulsar/jetcd-core-shaded/<VERSION>/jetcd-core-shaded-<VERSION>-shaded.jar \\\r\n  -d jetcd-core-shaded/target/shaded-classes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23635\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn some special scenarios, when the broker service has a deadlock, it needs to be able to automatically recover instead of requiring manual intervention. For example, when the service is deployed in a customer environment, we cannot directly manage it. If the service has a deadlock, the k8s probe should return a failure because the service may be unavailable. The probe failure triggers a broker pod restart to resolve the deadlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nAdd deadlock detection in the probe.
