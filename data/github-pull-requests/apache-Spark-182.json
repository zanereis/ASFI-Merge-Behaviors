In general, Scala generates a class name for a nested class by inserting the dollar-sign ( `$` ) in between each level of class nesting. The problem is that this format can concatenate into a very long string that goes beyond certain limits, so Scala will change the class name format beyond certain length threshold.\r\n\r\nFor the example above, we can see that the first two levels of class nesting have class names that look like this:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName2$\r\n```\r\nIf we leave out the fact that Scala uses a dollar-sign ( `$` ) suffix for the class name of the companion object, `OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1`'s full name is a prefix (substring) of `OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName2`.\r\n\r\nBut if we keep going deeper into the levels of nesting, you'll find names that look like:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$2a1321b953c615695d7442b2adb1$$$$ryVeryLongClassName8$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName9$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName10$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$2a1321b953c615695d7442b2adb1$$$$ryVeryLongClassName8$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName9$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName10$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName11$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName13$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName13$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName14$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName16$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName16$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName17$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName19$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName19$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName20$\r\n```\r\nwith a hash code in the middle and various levels of nesting omitted.\r\n\r\nThe `java.lang.Class.isMemberClass` method is implemented in JDK8u as:\r\nhttp://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/lang/Class.java#l1425\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns {@code true} if and only if the underlying class\r\n     * is a member class.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return {@code true} if and only if this class is a member class.\r\n     * @since 1.5\r\n     */\r\n    public boolean isMemberClass() {\r\n        return getSimpleBinaryName() != null && !isLocalOrAnonymousClass();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns the \"simple binary name\" of the underlying class, i.e.,\r\n     * the binary name without the leading enclosing class name.\r\n     * Returns {@code null} if the underlying class is a top level\r\n     * class.\r\n     */\r\n    private String getSimpleBinaryName() {\r\n        Class<?> enclosingClass = getEnclosingClass();\r\n        if (enclosingClass == null) // top level class\r\n            return null;\r\n        // Otherwise, strip the enclosing class' name\r\n        try {\r\n            return getName().substring(enclosingClass.getName().length());\r\n        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {\r\n            throw new InternalError(\"Malformed class name\", ex);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand the problematic code is `getName().substring(enclosingClass.getName().length())` -- if a class's enclosing class's full name is *longer* than the nested class's full name, this logic would end up going out of bounds.\r\n\r\nThe bug has been fixed in JDK9 by https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8057919 , but still exists in the latest JDK8u release. So from the Spark side we'd need to do something to avoid hitting this problem.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport of #31733.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI deleted several error-handlers like the following from the SparkR package `types.R` file. \r\n\r\n```r\r\n  if (any(field_strings == \"FloatType\")) {\r\n    stop(\"Arrow optimization in R does not support float type yet.\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the proposed changes, error handlers in `types.R` like the snippet below prevented arrow optimization from being to applied to float types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe R `arrow` package now supports `FloatType`, `BinaryType`, `ArrayType`,`StructType`. This was brought to my attention by Neal Richardson, maintainer of the R Arrow package, in the comments on this issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-3783\r\n\r\nThis change allows SparkR users to leverage arrow optimization for the additional types supported. Documentation for currently supported types can be viewed at https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/arrow.html#arrow-to-r \r\n\r\n```r\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql(\"SELECT float('1') AS x;\"))$x[[1]])\r\n## num 1\r\n\r\n## Warning message:In value[[3L]](cond) :  The conversion from Spark DataFrame to R DataFrame was attempted with Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.sparkr.enabled' is set to true; however, failed, attempting non-optimization. Reason: Error in checkSchemaInArrow(schema(x)): Arrow optimization in R does not support float type yet.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`FloatType`, `BinaryType`, `ArrayType`, and `StructType`, types will now be returned with arrow optimization (when `spark.sql.execution.arrow.sparkr.enabled = \"true\"` and the `R` `arrow` package is available in the executing environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built a copy of the SparkR package locally under R 3.6.0 using this branch, connected to a Databricks cluster running Databricks runtime version 7.3 LTS (Spark 3.0.1, Scala 2.12), and executed the following to test whether `FloatType` could be returned without error.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql(\"SELECT float('-9999999999999999.9999999999999') AS x1,\r\n                        float('-1.0') AS x2,\r\n                        float('-0.00001') AS x3,\r\n                        float('0') AS x4,\r\n                        float('0.00001') AS x5,\r\n                        float('1.0') AS x6,\r\n                        float('9999999999999999.9999999999999') AS x7;\")))\r\n\r\n# 'data.frame':\t1 obs. of  7 variables:\r\n#  $ x1: num -1e+16\r\n#  $ x2: num -1\r\n#  $ x3: num -1e-05\r\n#  $ x4: num 0\r\n#  $ x5: num 1e-05\r\n#  $ x6: num 1\r\n#  $ x7: num 1e+16\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, I executed a handful of quick tests verifying that `BinaryType`, `ArrayType`, and `StructType` could be returned as well.  However, I have not worked with these data types in Spark, so I think some additional testing is probably merited.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql(\"SELECT binary('0') x;\"))$x[[1]])\r\n# raw 30\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql('SELECT array(\\'{\"x\": [{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}]}\\') x;'))$x[[1]])\r\n# chr \"{\\\"x\\\": [{\\\"a\\\": 1, \\\"b\\\": 2, \\\"c\\\": 3}]}\"\r\nstr(collect(SparkR::sql(\"SELECT struct('1') x;\"))$x[[1]])\r\n# chr \"1\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-04T21:40:23Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T00:11:29Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T00:11:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a252c0026e0575239cfd9593802aa4ed731ade7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a4d9091260d7df9270792b4904376fbd0184e7cf","head":{"label":"msummersgill:msummersgill-arrow-supports-float","ref":"msummersgill-arrow-supports-float","sha":"a4d9091260d7df9270792b4904376fbd0184e7cf","user":{"login":"msummersgill","id":19575728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTc1NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19575728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill","html_url":"https://github.com/msummersgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344580561,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1ODA1NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"msummersgill/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"msummersgill","id":19575728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTc1NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19575728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill","html_url":"https://github.com/msummersgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msummersgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/msummersgill/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes Spark's behavior when `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints` is set to `true`. Previously, checkpoint data would be left around when Spark is shut down. With this PR, Spark now cleans up checkpoint data as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR also add a test to check that the `ShutdownHookManager.*_SHUTDOWN_PRIORITY` constants are in the relative order that their comments [say they should be in](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d7c3e9e53e01011f809b6cb145349ee8a9c5e5f0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/ShutdownHookManager.scala#L33-L46).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark's behavior does not match the description of the `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints` configuration. \r\n\r\n> Controls whether to clean checkpoint files if the reference is out of scope.\r\n\r\nWhen Spark is shut down, all references go out of scope. These changes bring Spark's behavior in line with the intended (and documented) behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Previously, if you set `cleanCheckpoints` to `true`, checkpoint some data, and then shut down Spark, that checkpoint data will be left intact. With this PR, that checkpoint data will now be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this PR manually as follows:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Cleanup checkpoint directory and start Spark.\r\ntrash ./checkpoint/\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf 'spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints=true'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Checkpoint some data and exit.\r\nspark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir('./checkpoint/')\r\nspark.range(3).checkpoint()\r\nimport sys; sys.exit()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Check that there is no checkpoint data in the checkpoint directory.\r\nll ./checkpoint/*\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-04T18:59:17Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T17:17:07Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T17:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1765692e6b16832f4eb7bfd4e6250827bed35601","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee6782bd376c0ea7ec720dabc436b9bb69a69651","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-33000-cleanup-checkpoint-on-shutdown","ref":"SPARK-33000-cleanup-checkpoint-on-shutdown","sha":"ee6782bd376c0ea7ec720dabc436b9bb69a69651","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome maven artifacts define non-jar dependencies. One such example is `hive-exec`'s dependency on the `pom` of `apache-curator` https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hive/hive-exec/2.3.8/hive-exec-2.3.8.pom\r\n\r\nToday trying to depend on such an artifact using `--packages` will print an error but continue without including the non-jar dependency. Doing the same using `spark.sql(\"ADD JAR ivy://org.apache.hive:hive-exec:2.3.8?exclude=org.pentaho:pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm\")` will cause a failure. Detailed stacktraces can be found in SPARK-34624.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a `Project` between `LocalLimit` and `Join` if `Join`'s output do not match the `LocalLimit`'s output. This pr add support push down limit through this case. For example:\r\n   ```scala\r\n   spark.sql(\"create table t1(a int, b int, c int) using parquet\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"create table t2(x int, y int, z int) using parquet\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"select a

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs a followup for #29818, document caveats of using the Arrow selfDestruct option in toPandas, which include:\r\n- toPandas() may be slower;\r\n- the resulting dataframe may not support some Pandas operations due to immutable backing arrays.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will hopefully reduce user confusion as with SPARK-34463.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes - documentation is updated and a config setting description is updated to clearly indicate the config is experimental.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a documentation-only change.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-04T16:37:07Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T11:45:29Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T04:30:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"108a390ac68ce6643f8d49378bcaf8854b976c3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31738/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31738/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31738/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0115e576e8fc1133acee9286e067a42703b792e","head":{"label":"lidavidm:spark-34463","ref":"spark-34463","sha":"b0115e576e8fc1133acee9286e067a42703b792e","user":{"login":"lidavidm","id":327919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm","html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297345247,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTczNDUyNDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"lidavidm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lidavidm","id":327919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm","html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm/spark","description":"Apache

This PR is only supporting inner and cross join. Other join types will be added later in followup PRs.\r\n\r\nExample query and generated code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(4).select($\"id\".as(\"k1\"))\r\nval df2 = spark.range(3).select($\"id\".as(\"k2\"))\r\ndf1.join(df2, $\"k1\" + 1 =!= $\"k2\").explain(\"codegen\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Subtree 2 / 2 (maxMethodCodeSize:282;

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR allows to return User-defined types (UDT) from PandasUDF.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(StructType([StructField(\"vec\", ArrayType(VectorUDT()))]))\r\ndef array_of_udt_structs(series: pd.Series) -> pd.DataFrame:\r\n      vectors = []\r\n      for _, i in series.items():\r\n          vectors.append({\"vec\": [DenseVector([i]), DenseVector([i * 2])]})\r\n      return pd.DataFrame(vectors)\r\n\r\n# Or\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(VectorUDT()))\r\ndef array_of_vectors(series: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n    vectors = []\r\n    for _, i in series.items():\r\n        vectors.append([DenseVector([i]), DenseVector([i * 2])])\r\n    return pd.Series(vectors)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR converts UDT into its corresponding `UDT.sqlType / StructType` before sending the results from PySpark worker to JVM.  In JVM , it relaxes the [requirements for schema checking](sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/python/ArrowEvalPythonExec.scala), so that Spark sql would consider UDT is compatible to its `sqlType` type. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have use cases that builds UDT to present semantic meanings of results. We use pandas UDF because certain computation (i.e., model inference) requiring expensive initialization, which makes Iterator based `PandasUDF` a desired implementation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(BoundingBox())\r\ndef object_detection(batches: Iterator[pd.Series]) -> pd.Series:\r\n     model = load_model()  // Expensive\r\n     for batch in batches:\r\n          ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUser can start to specify UDT in `pandas_udf`'s returnType \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch includes [3 tests](python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_pandas_udf_scalar.py) returning UDT in different forms

In general, Scala generates a class name for a nested class by inserting the dollar-sign ( `$` ) in between each level of class nesting. The problem is that this format can concatenate into a very long string that goes beyond certain limits, so Scala will change the class name format beyond certain length threshold.\r\n\r\nFor the example above, we can see that the first two levels of class nesting have class names that look like this:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName2$\r\n```\r\nIf we leave out the fact that Scala uses a dollar-sign ( `$` ) suffix for the class name of the companion object, `OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName1`'s full name is a prefix (substring) of `OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName2`.\r\n\r\nBut if we keep going deeper into the levels of nesting, you'll find names that look like:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$2a1321b953c615695d7442b2adb1$$$$ryVeryLongClassName8$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName9$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName10$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$2a1321b953c615695d7442b2adb1$$$$ryVeryLongClassName8$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName9$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName10$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName11$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName13$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$85f068777e7ecf112afcbe997d461b$$$$VeryLongClassName11$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName12$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName13$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName14$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName16$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$5f7ad51804cb1be53938ea804699fa$$$$VeryLongClassName14$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName15$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName16$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName17$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName19$\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassNam$$$$69b54f16b1965a31e88968df1a58d8$$$$VeryLongClassName17$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName18$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName19$OuterLevelWithVeryVeryVeryLongClassName20$\r\n```\r\nwith a hash code in the middle and various levels of nesting omitted.\r\n\r\nThe `java.lang.Class.isMemberClass` method is implemented in JDK8u as:\r\nhttp://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/lang/Class.java#l1425\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns {@code true} if and only if the underlying class\r\n     * is a member class.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return {@code true} if and only if this class is a member class.\r\n     * @since 1.5\r\n     */\r\n    public boolean isMemberClass() {\r\n        return getSimpleBinaryName() != null && !isLocalOrAnonymousClass();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns the \"simple binary name\" of the underlying class, i.e.,\r\n     * the binary name without the leading enclosing class name.\r\n     * Returns {@code null} if the underlying class is a top level\r\n     * class.\r\n     */\r\n    private String getSimpleBinaryName() {\r\n        Class<?> enclosingClass = getEnclosingClass();\r\n        if (enclosingClass == null) // top level class\r\n            return null;\r\n        // Otherwise, strip the enclosing class' name\r\n        try {\r\n            return getName().substring(enclosingClass.getName().length());\r\n        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {\r\n            throw new InternalError(\"Malformed class name\", ex);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nand the problematic code is `getName().substring(enclosingClass.getName().length())` -- if a class's enclosing class's full name is *longer* than the nested class's full name, this logic would end up going out of bounds.\r\n\r\nThe bug has been fixed in JDK9 by https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8057919 , but still exists in the latest JDK8u release. So from the Spark side we'd need to do something to avoid hitting this problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark use origin text sql to store view then capture and store sql config into view metadata.\r\n\r\nCapture config will skip some config with some prefix, e.g. `spark.sql.optimizer.` but unfortunately `spark.sql.optimizer.disableHints` is start with `spark.sql.optimizer.`.\r\n\r\nWe need a allow list to help capture the config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2021-03-04T03:42:51Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T05:04:51Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T04:20:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0eb4023cb83113aa33f88e15ac9ba3821a135a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d12709b9e0fa00b5c09fc02ba25d6989c5d64aa","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-34613","ref":"SPARK-34613","sha":"7d12709b9e0fa00b5c09fc02ba25d6989c5d64aa","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes a Python UDF `plus_one` used in `GroupedAggPandasUDFTests` to always return float (double) values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Python UDF `plus_one` used in `GroupedAggPandasUDFTests` is always returning `v + 1` regardless of its type. The return type of the UDF is 'double', so if the input is int, the result will be `null`.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.range(10).toDF('id') \\\r\n...             .withColumn(\"vs\", array([lit(i *

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend Spark SQL API to accept [`java.time.Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html) as an external type of recently added new Catalyst type - `DayTimeIntervalType` (see #31614). The Java class `java.time.Duration` has similar semantic to ANSI SQL day-time interval type, and it is the most suitable to be an external type for `DayTimeIntervalType`. In more details:\r\n1. Added `DurationConverter` which converts `java.time.Duration` instances to/from internal representation of the Catalyst type `DayTimeIntervalType` (to `Long` type). The `DurationConverter` object uses new methods of `IntervalUtils`:\r\n    - `durationToMicros()` converts the input duration to the total length in microseconds. If this duration is too large to fit `Long`, the method throws the exception `ArithmeticException`. **Note:** _the input duration has nanosecond precision, the method casts the nanos part to microseconds by dividing by 1000._\r\n    - `microsToDuration()` obtains a `java.time.Duration` representing a number of microseconds.\r\n2. Support new type `DayTimeIntervalType` in `RowEncoder` via the methods `createDeserializerForDuration()` and `createSerializerForJavaDuration()`.\r\n3. Extended the Literal API to construct literals from `java.time.Duration` instances. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To allow users parallelization of `java.time.Duration` collections, and construct day-time interval columns. Also to collect such columns back to the driver side.\r\n2. This will allow to write tests in other sub-tasks of SPARK-27790.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe PR extends existing functionality. So, users can parallelize instances of the `java.time.Duration` class and collect them back:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nscala> val ds = Seq(java.time.Duration.ofDays(10)).toDS\r\nds: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[java.time.Duration] = [value: daytimeinterval]\r\n\r\nscala> ds.collect\r\nres0: Array[java.time.Duration] = Array(PT240H)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a few tests to `CatalystTypeConvertersSuite` to check conversion from/to `java.time.Duration`.\r\n- Checking row encoding by new tests in `RowEncoderSuite`.\r\n- Making literals of `DayTimeIntervalType` are tested in `LiteralExpressionSuite`\r\n- Check collecting by `DatasetSuite` and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bit confusing to see `resolveExpressionBottomUp` and `resolveExpressionTopDown`, which provide similar functionalities but with different tree traverse order. It turns out that the real difference between these 2 methods is: which attributes should the columns be resolved to? `resolveExpressionTopDown` resolves columns using output attributes of the plan children, `resolveExpressionBottomUp` resolves columns using output attributes of the plan itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies `resolveExpressionBottomUp` and `resolveExpressionTopDown` and put the common logic in a new method, and let `resolveExpressionBottomUp` and `resolveExpressionTopDown` just call the new method. This PR also renames `resolveExpressionBottomUp` and `resolveExpressionTopDown` to make the difference clear.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing the potentially flaky test in `ExecutorPodsAllocatorSuite` where multiple resource profiles are used:\r\n- `SPARK-34361: scheduler backend known pods with multiple resource profiles at downscaling`\r\n- `SPARK-33288: multiple resource profiles` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nResource profiles in executor PODs allocator are processed in a nondeterministic order.\r\n\r\nEven as the tests are using Maps created by a constructor with two entries and the implementation behind is [Map2 where the iterator keeps the ordering](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/Map.scala#L291-L332) in the `setTotalExpectedExecutors()` method the entries are added to a `ConcurrentHashMap` `totalExpectedExecutorsPerResourceProfileId`. \r\n\r\nSo the resource allocation order might change from run to run.\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `addFile` and `addJar` further encode even though a URI form string is passed.\r\nFor example, the following operation will throw exception even though the file exists.\r\n```\r\nsc.addFile(\"file:/foo/test%20file.txt\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother case is `--files` and `--jars` option when we submit an application.\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --files \"/foo/test file.txt\"\r\n```\r\nThe path above is transformed to URI form [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ecf4811764f1ef91954c865a864e0bf6691f99a6/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmitArguments.scala#L400) and passed to `addFile` so the same issue happens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd Spark config \"spark.shuffle.markFileLostOnExecutorLost\" to not delete shuffle file on executor lost event\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34601\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are multiple work going on with disaggregated/remote shuffle service (e.g. LinkedIn shuffle, Facebook shuffle service, Uber shuffle service). Such remote shuffle service is not Spark External Shuffle Service. It could be third party shuffle solution and user uses it by setting spark.shuffle.manager. In those systems, shuffle data will be stored on different server other than executor. Spark should not mark shuffle data lost when the executor is lost. We could add a Spark configuration to control this behavior. By default, Spark still mark shuffle file lost. For disaggregated/remote shuffle service, people could set the configure to not mark shuffle file lost.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun Spark unit test\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-03T01:03:24Z","updated_at":"2021-03-06T05:08:48Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T18:12:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d554f0e71cf3e42d40d014f6bcd62f1f8a7fb95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1418e8f9507375f4fec025d8df357a86cb99ee45","head":{"label":"hiboyang:master","ref":"master","sha":"1418e8f9507375f4fec025d8df357a86cb99ee45","user":{"login":"hiboyang","id":14280154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjgwMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14280154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang","html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":324487461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjQ0ODc0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"hiboyang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hiboyang","id":14280154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjgwMTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14280154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang","html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiboyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hiboyang/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `Utils.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting `Malformed class name` error in `NewInstance.doGenCode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOn older JDK versions (e.g. JDK8u), nested Scala classes may trigger `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` to throw an `java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name` error.\r\nIn this particular case, creating an `ExpressionEncoder` on such a nested Scala class would create a `NewInstance` expression under the hood, which will trigger the problem during codegen.\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29050, we should use  Spark's `Utils.getSimpleName` utility function in place of `Class.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting the issue.\r\n\r\nThere are two other occurrences of `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` in the same file, but they're safe because they're only guaranteed to be only used on Java classes, which don't have this problem, e.g.:\r\n```scala\r\n    // Make a copy of the data if it's unsafe-backed\r\n    def makeCopyIfInstanceOf(clazz: Class[_ <: Any], value: String) =\r\n      s\"$value instanceof ${clazz.getSimpleName}? ${value}.copy() : $value\"\r\n    val genFunctionValue: String = lambdaFunction.dataType match {\r\n      case StructType(_) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeRow], genFunction.value)\r\n      case ArrayType(_, _) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeArrayData], genFunction.value)\r\n      case MapType(_, _, _) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeMapData], genFunction.value)\r\n      case _ => genFunction.value\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe Unsafe-* family of types are all Java types, so they're okay.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug that throws an error when using `ExpressionEncoder` on some nested Scala types, otherwise no changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case to `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite`. It'll fail on JDK8u before the fix, and pass after the fix.","created_at":"2021-03-02T11:25:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-06T20:51:25Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T03:23:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8692a6bd9f42c2c7f0e40adc23af512e4283b83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4e92aab30b6968703b734eac0713a55c5c0d385","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:spark-34596-master","ref":"spark-34596-master","sha":"d4e92aab30b6968703b734eac0713a55c5c0d385","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec` does not preserve `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` right now. But it can preserve the streamed side partitioning and ordering when possible. This can help avoid shuffle and sort in later stage, if there's join and aggregation in the query. See example queries in added unit test in `JoinSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, fix a bunch of minor places in `BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.scala` for better style and readability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid shuffle and sort for certain complicated query shape. Better query performance can be achieved.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `JoinSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-03-02T09:49:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T06:47:32Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T04:32:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0810eba950c0d47c9f06760bdb20a57c01f0c96b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e6729cc89ac05f6842d335e7ac59fb765a827db","head":{"label":"c21:nested-join","ref":"nested-join","sha":"9e6729cc89ac05f6842d335e7ac59fb765a827db","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to mark indeterminate RDD in Web UI. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt is somehow hard to track which part is indeterminate in a graph of RDDs. In some cases we may need to track indeterminate RDDs. For example, indeterminate map stage fails and Spark is unable to fallback some parent stages. The developers are usually unable to easily identify indeterminate part from the complicated RDD computation. If Web UI can show up indeterminate RDD like cached RDD, it could be useful to track it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, there is a UI change for users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManual check with Web UI locally. Updated existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"544\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-03-02 at 12 38 02 AM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes a new feature that allows developers to debug test code using JDWP with sbt an Maven.\r\nMore specifically, this PR introduces the following profile options.\r\n\r\n* `jdwp-test-debug`: An profile which controls enable/disable JDWP debug\r\n* `test.jdwp.address`: An option which corresponds to `address` option in JDWP\r\n* `test.jdwp.suspend`: An option which corresponds to `suspend` option in JDWP\r\n* `test.jdwp.server`: An option which corresponds to `server` option in JDWP\r\n* `test.debug.suite`: An option which controls whether debug ScalaStyle suites (Maven only)\r\n\r\nFor `sbt`, this feature can be used like `build/sbt -Pjdwp-test-debug -Dtest.jdwp.address=localhost:9876 -Dtest.jdwp.suspend=y -Dtest.jdwp.server=y` and can be used for both JUnit tests and ScalaTest tests.\r\n\r\nFor `Maven`, this feature can be used like as follows:\r\n\r\n(For JUnit tests) `build/mvn -Pjdwp-test-debug -Dtest.jdwp.address=localhost:9876 -Dtest.jdwp.suspend=y -Dtest.jdwp.server=y`\r\n(For ScalaTest suites) `build/mvn -Pjdwp-test-debug -Dtest.debug.suite=true -Dtest.jdwp.address=localhost:9876 -Dtest.jdwp.suspend=y -Dtest.jdwp.server=y` (It might be useful to specify specific sub-modules like `-pl sql/core,sql/catalyst`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's useful to debug test code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed the following things.\r\n\r\n* `jdwp-tes-debug` can switch JDWP enabled/disabled\r\n* `test.jdwp.address` can change address and port.\r\n* `test.jdwp.suspend` can change the behavior that the target debugee suspends or not.\r\n* `test.jdwp.server` can change the behavior that the JDWP debugger run as a server or client.\r\n* ScalaTest suites can be debugged with Maven with setting `test.debug.suite` to `true`.","created_at":"2021-03-02T07:44:49Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T17:24:34Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T17:24:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e073cd0f80bc3bc4b374b9dd2bde68fb3b3c3368","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31706/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31706/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31706/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0461ee5d166c0031c2964c6f55312503566184a","head":{"label":"sarutak:sbt-jdwp","ref":"sbt-jdwp","sha":"d0461ee5d166c0031c2964c6f55312503566184a","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR shows one potential way to support required distribution and ordering in SS, which is marked as a blocker for 3.2.\r\n\r\n**Important!** This change does not try to address other relevant TODO items like refreshing the cache or performing more checks using the capability API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed so that data sources can request a specific distribution and ordering not only for batch but also for micro-batch writes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. This PR aims to ignore ORC encryption tests when ORC shim is loaded by old Hadoop library by some other tests. The test coverage is preserved by Jenkins SBT runs and GitHub Action jobs. This PR only aims to recover Maven Jenkins jobs.\r\n2. In addition, this PR simplifies SBT testing by refactor the test config to `SparkBuild.scala/pom.xml` and remove `DedicatedJVMTest`. This will remove one GitHub Action job which was recently added for `DedicatedJVMTest` tag.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Maven test fails when it runs in a batch mode because `HadoopShimsPre2_3$NullKeyProvider` is loaded.\r\n\r\n**MVN COMMAND**\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -pl sql/core --am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.OrcV1QuerySuite,org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.OrcEncryptionSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n- Write and read an encrypted table *** FAILED ***\r\n...\r\n  Cause: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 1.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1) (localhost executor driver): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown key pii\r\n\tat org.apache.orc.impl.HadoopShimsPre2_3$NullKeyProvider.getCurrentKeyVersion(HadoopShimsPre2_3.java:71)\r\n\tat org.apache.orc.impl.WriterImpl.getKey(WriterImpl.java:871)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\nOrcV1QuerySuite\r\n...\r\nOrcEncryptionSuite:\r\n- Write and read an encrypted file !!!

tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins Maven tests.\r\n\r\nFor SBT command, \r\n- the test suite required a dedicated JVM (Before)\r\n- the test suite doesn't require a dedicated JVM (After)\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the `ResetSystemProperties` trait to `SQLQuerySuite` so that system property changes made by any of the tests will not affect other suites/tests. Specifically, the system property changes made by `SPARK-33084: Add jar support Ivy URI in SQL -- jar contains udf class` are targeted here (which sets and then clears `ivy.home`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPR #29966 added a new test case that adjusts the `ivy.home` system property to force Ivy to resolve an artifact from a custom location. At the end of the test, the value is cleared. Clearing the value meant that, if a custom value of `ivy.home` was configured externally, it would not apply for tests run after this test case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is only in tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests continue to pass, whether or not `spark.jars.ivySettings` is configured (which adjusts the behavior of Ivy w.r.t. handling of `ivy.home` and `ivy.default.ivy.user.dir` properties).","created_at":"2021-03-01T17:53:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T23:58:57Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T23:53:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8985482154cc3251965da57b14129361c5c2c0be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31694/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31694/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31694/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/840b630b595355f5e5eba7d7d420d391eb5ef60d","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-33084-ivyhome-sysprop-followon","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-33084-ivyhome-sysprop-followon","sha":"840b630b595355f5e5eba7d7d420d391eb5ef60d","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `bundler exec jekyll` build fails to generate Scala API docs even though after `dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13` run.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe reason of this issue is that `build/sbt` in `copy_api_dirs.rb` runs without `-Pscala-2.13`.\r\nSo, it's a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI tested the following patterns manually.\r\n\r\n* `dev/change-scala-version 2.13` and then `bundler exec jekyll build`\r\n* `dev/change-scala-version 2.12` to change back to Scala 2.12 and then `bundler exec jekyll build`\r\n* `dev/change-scala-version 2.13` two times to confirm the idempotency and then `bundler exec jekyll build`\r\n* `dev/change-scala-version 2.12` two times to confirm the idempotency and then `bundler exec jekyll build`","created_at":"2021-03-01T05:07:44Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T09:43:08Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T06:36:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b55444109300ad70a03c9135d285ba84862627e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2d47d12f5357e1111871ed425cbefd154d8fafb","head":{"label":"sarutak:jekyll-scala-2.13","ref":"jekyll-scala-2.13","sha":"f2d47d12f5357e1111871ed425cbefd154d8fafb","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the `SQLConf` object, the `sqlConfEntries` map is globally synchronized (it is a Java `Collections.synchronizedMap`): any operation, including a get, will need to acquire the lock. \r\n\r\nAn example of this is calling the `DatatType.sameType` method. This will trigger a check on `SQLConf.get.caseSensitiveAnalysis`. So every time we compare two datatypes with sameType, we hit a lock.\r\n\r\nTo avoid having multiple tasks locking on this, a better approach would be to use a map that does not lock on read (like a `ConcurrentHashMap`). This map implementation does not lock on read, and on write it only locks the map partially. The only lock that happens is on write on the same map key.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMultiple tasks performing any operation that directly or indirectly trigger a query to the `SQLConf.sqlConfEntries` map, will require acquiring a global lock on that map. Something as easy as calling `DataType.sameType(...)` would be locking on the global `sqlConfEntries` lock of the `Collections.synchronizedMap`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo functionality change. Existing unit tests run normally.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-01T04:39:02Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T08:59:06Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T06:37:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"daf09b0b74f2ee3ee86bb02be80d9025659d7584","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ffa2576782e410cef4d5cb3d8865362679ff11c","head":{"label":"sparkyengine:SPARK-34573","ref":"SPARK-34573","sha":"4ffa2576782e410cef4d5cb3d8865362679ff11c","user":{"login":"sparkyengine","id":1545350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDUzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine","html_url":"https://github.com/sparkyengine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sparkyengine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3d0ee9604eab3c01af469049d80b053bf2aaa636","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAn Invalid reference to the model_selection_random_hyperparameters_example.py was added in  [commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/397b843890db974a0534394b1907d33d62c2b888#diff-02f10976f2f83e219445cd4860a2999f45dc254b173f1ffefb323d8fe1d1c817R100-R108) which is causing the (Linters, licenses, dependencies and documentation generation) checks to fail. I am proposing to remove this reference so that builds can run successfully. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause the (Linters, licenses, dependencies and documentation generation) check has been failing because of the invalid reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI tested this manually using

to revive #23721 from @nandorKollar:\r\n\r\n> ## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n> \r\n> A new, more flexible logical type API was introduced in parquet-mr 1.11.0 (based on the the Thrift field in parquet-format available for a while). This change migrates from the old (now deprecated) enum-based OriginalType API to this new logical type API.\r\n> \r\n> In addition to replacing the deprecated API calls, this PR also introduces support for reading the new subtypes for different timestamp semantics.\r\n> \r\n> Since parquet-mr 1.11.0 is not yet released, this is tested against a release candidate. Before merging, the additional repository should be deleted from pom.xml, which can only be done once parquet-mr 1.11.0 is released.\r\n> ## How was this patch tested?\r\n> \r\n> Unit tests were added to the PR.\r\n\r\nI intentionally left the conflicts in the merge commit, so that it becomes clear how I've chosen (on a best effort basis...) to resolve them - this is obviously WIP.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that this is my first PR for spark, so I'm probably in above my head, and happy to close this PR if desired (or take any

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pr proposes to add `deprecated()`/ `removed()` / `alternated()` functions to `ConfigBuilder` in order to provide more convenient ways to do these stuff.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark maintains the active configs and deprecated/alternated/removed configs separately,\r\nwhich is not convenient when developers want to deprecate configs and not good to maintain for the long term.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, developers can deprecate/alternate/remove a config like this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval SOME_CONFIG =\r\n  buildConf(\"spark.xxx.yyy.zzz\")\r\n    .doc(\".....\")\")\r\n    .version(\"2.3.0\")\r\n    .deprecated(\"3.0\", \"because...\")\r\n    // .removed(\"3.0\", \"because...\")\r\n    // .alternated((\"3.0\", \"spark.aaa.bbb.ccc\"))\r\n    .booleanConf\r\n    .createWithDefault(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\npyrolite 4.21 introduced and enabled value comparison by default (`valueCompare=true`) during object memoization and serialization: https://github.com/irmen/Pyrolite/blob/pyrolite-4.21/java/src/main/java/net/razorvine/pickle/Pickler.java#L112-L122\r\nThis change has undesired effect when we serialize a row (actually `GenericRowWithSchema`) to be passed to python: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-3.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/python/EvaluatePython.scala#L60. A simple example is that \r\n```\r\nnew GenericRowWithSchema(Array(1.0, 1.0), StructType(Seq(StructField(\"_1\", DoubleType), StructField(\"_2\", DoubleType))))\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nnew GenericRowWithSchema(Array(1, 1), StructType(Seq(StructField(\"_1\", IntegerType), StructField(\"_2\", IntegerType))))\r\n```\r\nare currently equal and the second instance is replaced to the short code of the first one during serialization.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe above can cause nasty issues like the one in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34545 description:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>> \r\n>>> def udf1(data_type):\r\n        def u1(e):\r\n            return e[0]\r\n        return udf(u1, data_type)\r\n>>> \r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([((1.0, 1.0), (1, 1))], ['c1', 'c2'])\r\n>>> \r\n>>> df = df.withColumn(\"c3\", udf1(DoubleType())(\"c1\"))\r\n>>> df = df.withColumn(\"c4\", udf1(IntegerType())(\"c2\"))\r\n>>> \r\n>>> df.select(\"c3\").show()\r\n+---+\r\n| c3|\r\n+---+\r\n|1.0|\r\n+---+\r\n\r\n>>> df.select(\"c4\").show()\r\n+---+\r\n| c4|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n+---+\r\n\r\n>>> df.select(\"c3\", \"c4\").show()\r\n+---+----+\r\n| c3|  c4|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|1.0|null|\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\nThis is because during serialization from JVM to Python `GenericRowWithSchema(1.0, 1.0)` (`c1`) is memoized first and when `GenericRowWithSchema(1, 1)` (`c2`) comes next, it is replaced to some short code of the `c1` (instead of serializing `c2` out) as they are `equal()`. The python functions then runs but the return type of `c4` is expected to be `IntegerType` and if a different type (`DoubleType`) comes back from python then it is discarded: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-3.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/python/EvaluatePython.scala#L108-L113\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n>>> df.select(\"c3\", \"c4\").show()\r\n+---+---+\r\n| c3| c4|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|1.0|  1|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT + manual tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-28T13:50:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T12:54:09Z","closed_at":"2021-03-08T01:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d5d0339ed079e3c374e9db738d40ee863c26041","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen SparkContext is initialed, if we want to start SparkSession, when we call \r\n`SparkSession.builder.enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()`, the SparkSession we created won't have hive support since \r\nwe have't reset existed SC's conf's `spark.sql.catalogImplementation`.\r\nIn this PR we use sharedState.conf to decide whether we should enable Hive Support.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe should respect `enableHiveSupport`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExtend the `CollapseWindow` rule to collapse `Window` nodes, that have `Project` between them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe analyzer will turn a `dataset.withColumn(\"colName\", expressionWithWindowFunction)` method call to a `Project - Window - Project` chain in the logical plan. When this method is called multiple times in a row, then the projects can block the `Window` nodes from being collapsed by the current `CollapseWindow` rule.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to generate \"stable\" output attributes per the logical node of the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```scala\r\nval tbl = \"testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl\"\r\nsql(s\"CREATE TABLE $tbl (c0 INT) USING _\")\r\nval description = sql(s\"DESCRIBE TABLE $tbl\")\r\ndescription.drop(\"comment\")\r\n```\r\nThe `drop()` method fails with the error:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) col_name#102,data_type#103 missing from col_name#29,data_type#30,comment#31 in operator !Project [col_name#102, data_type#103]. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: col_name,data_type. Please check if the right attribute(s) are used.;\r\n!Project [col_name#102, data_type#103]\r\n+- LocalRelation [col_name#29, data_type#30, comment#31]\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.failAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:51)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.failAnalysis$(CheckAnalysis.scala:50)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `drop()`/`add()` works as expected:\r\n```scala\r\ndescription.drop(\"comment\").show()\r\n+---------------+---------+\r\n|       col_name|data_type|\r\n+---------------+---------+\r\n|             c0|      int|\r\n|               |         |\r\n| # Partitioning|         |\r\n|Not partitioned|         |\r\n+---------------+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Run new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *DataSourceV2SQLSuite\"\r\n```\r\n2. Run existing test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to generate unique attributes in the logical nodes of the `SHOW TABLES` command.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes similar issues in other logical nodes:\r\n- ShowTableExtended\r\n- ShowViews\r\n- ShowTableProperties\r\n- ShowFunctions\r\n- ShowColumns\r\n- ShowPartitions\r\n- ShowNamespaces\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issue which is demonstrated by the example below:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val show1 = sql(\"SHOW TABLES IN ns1\")\r\nshow1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [namespace: string, tableName: string ... 1 more field]\r\n\r\nscala> val show2 = sql(\"SHOW TABLES IN ns2\")\r\nshow2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [namespace: string, tableName: string ... 1 more field]\r\n\r\nscala> show1.show\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|tableName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|      ns1|     tbl1|      false|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> show2.show\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|tableName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|      ns2|     tbl2|      false|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> show1.join(show2).where(show1(\"tableName\") =!= show2(\"tableName\")).show\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Column tableName#17 are ambiguous. It's probably because you joined several Datasets together, and some of these Datasets are the same. This column points to one of the Datasets but Spark is unable to figure out which one. Please alias the Datasets with different names via `Dataset.as` before joining them, and specify the column using qualified name, e.g. `df.as(\"a\").join(df.as(\"b\"), $\"a.id\" > $\"b.id\")`. You can also set spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin to false to disable this check.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.analysis.DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin$.apply(DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin.scala:157)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works as expected:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> show1.join(show2).where(show1(\"tableName\") =!= show2(\"tableName\")).show\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|tableName|isTemporary|namespace|tableName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n|      ns1|     tbl1|      false|      ns2|     tbl2|      false|\r\n+---------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the new test:\r\n```\r\n$  build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

The spec (PART) must match the partition spec (part) defined in table '`default`.`tbl`'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the command above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl PARTITION (PART=2) SET LOCATION '/Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/bbb';\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n0\t2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-27T07:12:17Z","updated_at":"2021-02-28T05:04:33Z","closed_at":"2021-02-28T05:04:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60e09c4c569c6061f0784ab4c13d4987199569a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/961e8513a0287324a39b0ed7597676cf04cf0952","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:set-location-case-sense-3.0","ref":"set-location-case-sense-3.0","sha":"961e8513a0287324a39b0ed7597676cf04cf0952","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes partition spec parsing respect case sensitive conf.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen parsing the partition spec, Spark will call `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParserUtils.checkDuplicateKeys` to check if there are duplicate partition column names in the list. But this method is always case sensitive and doesn't detect duplicate partition column names when using different cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYep.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` we use deprecated APIs in a few places from Parquet, such as `readFooter`, `ParquetInputSplit`, `new ParquetFileReader`, `filterRowGroups`, etc. This replaces these with the newer APIs. In specific this:\r\n- Replaces `ParquetInputSplit` with `FileSplit`. We never use specific things in the former such as `rowGroupOffsets` so the swap is pretty simple.\r\n- Removes `readFooter` calls by using `ParquetFileReader.open`\r\n- Replace deprecated `ParquetFileReader` ctor with the newer API which takes `ParquetReadOptions`.\r\n- Removes the unnecessary handling of case when `rowGroupOffsets` is not null. It seems this never happens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned APIs were deprecated and is going to be removed at some point in future. This is to ensure better supportability. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a cleanup and relies on existing tests on the relevant code paths.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-26T19:04:52Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T07:51:53Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T07:51:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"785314ea56a923b995e06af00e7afaf10976122b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f5d922382094f64882a30ff31332a777cfbf823","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-32703","ref":"SPARK-32703","sha":"7f5d922382094f64882a30ff31332a777cfbf823","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds the duplicated common columns as hidden columns to the Projection used to rewrite NATURAL/USING JOINs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllows users to resolve either side of the NATURAL/USING JOIN's common keys.\r\nPreviously, the user could only resolve the following columns:\r\n\r\n| Join type | Left key columns | Right key columns |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Inner | Yes | No |\r\n| Left | Yes | No |\r\n| Right | No | Yes |\r\n| Outer | No | No |\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The user can now symmetrically resolve the common columns from a NATURAL/USING JOIN.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSQL-side tests. The behavior matches PostgreSQL and MySQL.","created_at":"2021-02-26T18:47:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T15:52:14Z","closed_at":"2021-04-14T07:01:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b35edc90a6b645e69b3ea8d2ba9edc0dace79e77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f70c2d416077716d0c346d6f7c5eea7ab6a81e5","head":{"label":"karenfeng:spark-34527","ref":"spark-34527","sha":"8f70c2d416077716d0c346d6f7c5eea7ab6a81e5","user":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263201423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyMDE0MjM=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"karenfeng/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng/spark-1","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExternalCatalog call getPartition restores partition-level stats from Hive table metadata. However, listPartitions and listPartitionsByFilter calls do not restore these partition stats, which leads to discrepancies between returned CatalogPartition between these API calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix discrepancies between similar APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs. Ideally this should also be tested in `ExternalCatalogSuite`, but there's no existing tests in `ExternalCatalogSuite` for metastore stats. I can add tests if reviewers raise concern.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-26T09:15:48Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T00:08:31Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T00:08:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baebf854e606b86d0b4d86747009f27988d0232b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d702295a498e3d63b36fbad0309d4c365976ecd3","head":{"label":"yeshengm:externalcatalog","ref":"externalcatalog","sha":"d702295a498e3d63b36fbad0309d4c365976ecd3","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nToday, child expressions may be resolved based on \"real\" or metadata output attributes.

This is likely unexpected, as the user may not know about the metadata attribute.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle` config option which, if set to true, causes `OptimizeSkewedJoin` to perform skew mitigation even if it requires a new shuffle to be performed.\r\nFor example, current behavior is not perform skew mitigation in the following query\r\n```\r\nProject\r\n|-Group By key1\r\n  |-SMJ on key1 = key2\r\n```\r\nWith `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle=true`, the SMJ will become `skew=true` and a new shuffle will be added for the Aggregate.  New shuffle itself will be processed by AQE and coalesced, etc if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt enables AQE to apply in cases where the cost of extra shuffle is less than the cost of unmitigated skew.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, with `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle=false`, which is the default\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew UTs + enhancements of existing ones","created_at":"2021-02-25T21:09:16Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T00:11:32Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T00:11:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1197b255af9f948c4ae019cea4d5c7667a654ca3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cfda59a1e9a8e0f86e2e6424c21639c1b5b14e3","head":{"label":"ekoifman:SPARK-33832_StagePrep","ref":"SPARK-33832_StagePrep","sha":"7cfda59a1e9a8e0f86e2e6424c21639c1b5b14e3","user":{"login":"ekoifman","id":4297661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTc2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4297661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman","html_url":"https://github.com/ekoifman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":313738951,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTM3Mzg5NTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ekoifman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ekoifman","id":4297661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTc2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4297661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman","html_url":"https://github.com/ekoifman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekoifman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ekoifman/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes the following:\r\n   * `AlterViewAs.query` is currently analyzed in the physical operator `AlterViewAsCommand`, but it should be analyzed during the analysis phase.\r\n   *  When `spark.sql.legacy.storeAnalyzedPlanForView` is set to true, store `TermporaryViewRelation` which wraps the analyzed plan, similar to #31273.\r\n   *  Try to uncache the view you are altering.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAnalyzing a plan should be done in the analysis phase if possible.\r\n\r\nNot uncaching the view (existing behavior) seems like a bug since the cache may not be used again.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the view can be uncached if it's already cached.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new tests around uncaching.\r\n\r\nThe existing tests such as `SQLViewSuite` should cover the analysis changes.","created_at":"2021-02-25T18:21:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T05:31:54Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T05:31:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fd72e04c3e4e16992a34c107136668ba7eebe0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e4815a03d0d423ac377b6c3f7ce05f102ab0087","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_view_child","ref":"alter_view_child","sha":"7e4815a03d0d423ac377b6c3f7ce05f102ab0087","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreprocess the partition spec passed to the V1 `ALTER TABLE .. SET LOCATION` implementation `AlterTableSetLocationCommand`, and normalize the passed spec according to the partition columns w.r.t the case sensitivity flag  **spark.sql.caseSensitive**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nV1 `ALTER TABLE .. SET LOCATION` is case sensitive in fact, and doesn't respect the SQL config **spark.sql.caseSensitive** which is false by default, for instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl (id INT, part INT) PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl PARTITION (part=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'tbl' PARTITION (part=0);\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl ADD PARTITION (part=1);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\nCreate new partition folder in the file system:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/aaa\r\n```\r\nSet new location for the partition part=1:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl PARTITION (part=1) SET LOCATION '/Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/aaa';\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl ADD PARTITION (PART=2);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n```\r\nSet location for a partition in the upper case:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/bbb\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl PARTITION (PART=2) SET LOCATION '/Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/bbb';\r\nError in query: Partition spec is invalid. The spec (PART) must match the partition spec (part) defined in table '`default`.`tbl`'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the command above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl PARTITION (PART=2) SET LOCATION '/Users/maximgekk/proj/set-location-case-sense/spark-warehouse/tbl/bbb';\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n0\t2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-25T16:32:03Z","updated_at":"2021-02-27T07:28:05Z","closed_at":"2021-02-26T07:29:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd6b5c11f5ab7c1bf6fdea337e0ddf176b1e20ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a6de201b4d5beb758f70c67c0bb77d279890357","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:set-location-case-sense","ref":"set-location-case-sense","sha":"6a6de201b4d5beb758f70c67c0bb77d279890357","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a mistake in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31273. When CREATE OR REPLACE a temp view, we need to uncache the to-be-replaced existing temp view. However, we shouldn't uncache if there is no existing temp view.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cause real issues because the uncache action is failure-safe. But it produces a lot of warning messages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary warning logs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmanually run tests and check the warning messages.","created_at":"2021-02-25T15:52:59Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T23:26:37Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T23:25:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fd091108ce5fb4526a9fea3b1fce323046773bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47d2becac13b16e778a6ba9475502fdc3f297b1f","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:warnning","ref":"warnning","sha":"47d2becac13b16e778a6ba9475502fdc3f297b1f","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

The scala-maven-plugin is the mave plugin, which is used by Spark, one of the function is to integrate the Zinc to enable the incremental compiler.\r\n- Since Spark v3.0.0

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd `Not(In)` and `Not(InSet)` pattern when convert filter to metastore. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`NOT IN` is a useful condition to prune partition, it would be better to support it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, we can convert `c not in(x,y)` to `c != x and c != y`, then push it to metastore.\r\n\r\nAvoid metastore overflow and respect the config `spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruningInSetThreshold`, `Not(InSet)` won't push to metastore if it's value exceeds the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2021-02-25T12:29:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T01:16:10Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T15:20:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc3ce3a0db9ef141e115c296589bae7103ddcc4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17aea47f717827f42a12fccc7e5901403f69b323","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-34538","ref":"SPARK-34538","sha":"17aea47f717827f42a12fccc7e5901403f69b323","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache
