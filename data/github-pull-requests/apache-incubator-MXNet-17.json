Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the slice operator export from MXNet into ONNX.\r\n\r\n@MoritzMaxeiner reported this problem already: **Incorrect ONNX export of SliceChannel** https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13061.\r\nThe corresponding pull request **ONNX export: Support equal length splits** https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14121 however, only partially solved the problem.\r\n\r\nThe output of the slice operator was corrected but it is still not properly handled in the `get_inputs()` function.\r\n\r\nThe following unit test demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass SplitConcatBlock(HybridBlock):\r\n    \"\"\"Block which creates two splits and later concatenates them\"\"\"\r\n    def __init__(self, name):\r\n        super(SplitConcatBlock, self).__init__(name)\r\n\r\n    def hybrid_forward(self, F, x):\r\n        splits = F.split(x, axis=1, num_outputs=2)\r\n        return F.concat(*splits)\r\n\r\ndef test_onnx_export_slice(self):\r\n     net = nn.HybridSequential(prefix='slice_net')\r\n     with net.name_scope():\r\n         net.add(nn.Dense(100, activation='relu'), SplitConcatBlock(\"splitConcat\"), nn.Dense(10))\r\n     _check_onnx_export(net)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the conversion of the model from MXNet into ONNX resulted in the following error:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mxnet_export_test.py\", line 134, in test_onnx_export_slice\r\n    _check_onnx_export(net)\r\n  File \"mxnet_export_test.py\",

topologically sorted, however input 'slice_netsplitConcatsplit0' of node: \r\ninput: \"slice_netsplitConcatsplit0\" input: \"slice_netsplitConcatsplit0\" output: \"slice_netsplitConcatconcat0\" name: \"slice_netsplitConcatconcat0\" op_type: \"Concat\" attribute { name: \"axis\" i: 1 type: INT }\r\n is not output of any previous nodes.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is resolved by replacing:\r\n```python\r\n        input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].name)\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```python\r\n        try:\r\n            # ip[1] defines which output index to use\r\n            input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].output[ip[1]])\r\n        except AttributeError:\r\n            # fallback to the name attribute as output if the output attribute does not exist (e.g. for data nodes)\r\n            input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, @RuRo fixed the shape inference problem in https://github.com/QueensGambit/incubator-mxnet/pull/1 because previously the ONNX export assumed that the shape is fixed throughout the whole network.\r\nAnother unit-test was added to verify this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    @with_seed()\r\n    def test_onnx_export_slice_changing_shape(self):\r\n        net = nn.HybridSequential(prefix='slice_net_changing_shape')\r\n        with net.name_scope():\r\n            net.add(nn.Dense(100, activation='relu'), SplitConcatBlock(\"splitConcat\"),\r\n                    nn.Dense(50, activation='relu'), SplitConcatBlock(\"splitConcat2\"), nn.Dense(10))\r\n        _check_onnx_export(net)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where

Description ##\r\nThese operators are often used with mx.module APIs. Removing them for mxnet 2.0. You can find equivalent loss functions in mx.gluon.loss namespace. \r\n\r\nThese APIs will still be maintained in the 1.x branch\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17676\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nFixing issue #17840. Referring to [the tutorial](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/tensor_expr_get_started.html), the problems causing the issue #17840 include:\r\n- The TVMOp GPU module was not saved,\r\n- The TVMOp GPU module was not loaded or imported.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the issue by saving the compiled GPU module to `libtvmop.cubin` and loading it when `import mxnet`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

Description ##\r\nThis PR removes the mx.module APIs for MXNet 2.0. The API will be still supported and maintained in the 1.x branch. \r\n\r\nThis PR also removes all examples depending on `mx.module`. For documentation that mentions both Gluon and Module usages, the description about Module usage is removed. \r\n\r\n#17676 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge,

Description ##\r\nRemoved diverge implementation of mixed type binary op between linux and windows.\r\nLinux implementation is adopted.\r\n#18281\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nIn this PR, I am removing the `mx.rnn` APIs. Going forward, `gluon.rnn` APIs will be used for RNN networks instead. \r\n\r\n#17676\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nHi there.\r\nIn previous version, the MKLDNN and CUDNN implementation of BatchNorm  will be invoked when axis is 1. In other axis, the naive implementation will be applied.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, it support calling MKLDNN and CUDNN Batch Norm in arbitrary axis. \r\n\r\nIf the shape of input `A` is `shape`, the input will be shaped into `(prod(shape[0:axis]), shape[axis], 1, prod(shape[axis+1:len(shape)]))`.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the PR #18500, and it should be merged after #18500 .\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe unittest `test_symbol.py` seems to be removed in the previous PR.\r\n~I add a new param `mkldnn_off` into BatchNorm, since it is not numerical stable when the input is  extremely large. It will leads to the failure of `tests/python/unittest/test_symbol.py:test_load_000800`~\r\n```\r\n[2020-06-11T06:53:50.575Z] Items are not equal:\r\n[2020-06-11T06:53:50.575Z] Error 1.072210 exceeds

Description ##\r\nBoth `InferShape` and `InferType` functions can be called from different threads than the worker thread calling forward. Previously only `intermediate_shapes_`/`intermediate_dtypes_` were protected, but those methods change also the `subgraph_` filed of `FusedOp`. That is why the lock needs to guard both functions from the beginning.\r\n\r\nFYI @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades the MXNet TensorRT integration to use the new TensorRT 7.0 API and refactor it to fully use the new Partition API (described in #17623 and previous related PRs).\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to use the new `optimize_for` method to run the full optimization (graph partitioning + TensorRT creation) in a single pass instead of the previous `get_backend_symbol` + `init_tensorrt_params` two stage optimization.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Update the TensorRT API calls to TensorRT 7.0\r\n- The new Partition API adds a `PrePartition` member function to `SubgraphProperty` that allows us to modify the graph before the partitioning and Subgraph optimization pass. It also give us a way to access the params (args and aux) during the partitioning. \r\nAdd PrePartition to the TensorRT partitioning backend and change to logic to pass the params to the TensorRT backend directly during the optimization (hence making obsolete `init_tensorrt_params`). \r\n- Update the tests to use `optimize_for` instead of `get_backend_symbol`.\r\n\r\n\r\n:warning: This PR

Description ##\r\nRevert the changes to `get_start` version dropdown in #18473 which caused the dropdown content not responding to version select, will submit another follow up PR with better solution\r\n\r\nThe reason of the bug is the version dropdown on get start page must use current format, for example \"v1.5.1\", \"v\" and \".\" is mandatory or it will break the parsing rule in `option.js`. But for general version dropdown and global search dropdown, the version format is slightly different from it.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Revert changes to get start page version

Description ##\r\n`optimize_for` API takes `args` and `aux` params and was initially modeled on the Symbol Bind API that accepts both list and dictionary types. However, the list use-case is no longer used. Currently args/aux comes from `load_checkpoint` API which returns dictionaries. With the support for custom graph passes, backends can add/remove params from args/aux. This is not feasible with lists. This PR removes support for lists for args/aux.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-04T07:43:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T17:42:10Z","closed_at":"2020-06-08T17:42:10Z","merged_at":"2020-06-08T17:42:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"028d01d5fb4867988a5ca50634562c1f4e75ca6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis is a backport of PR #18419\r\nFix einsum gradient in one dim situation\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-04T03:01:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T02:34:53Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T02:34:53Z","merged_at":"2020-06-05T02:34:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1bb3070e63a748c3c785e0e91fb84cdb1e69599","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a1ddb0b2db549b567517fdd716d2db5007d2eba2","head":{"label":"hanke580:einsum-backport","ref":"einsum-backport","sha":"a1ddb0b2db549b567517fdd716d2db5007d2eba2","user":{"login":"hanke580","id":38852697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODUyNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38852697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580","html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225536280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjU1MzYyODA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hanke580/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanke580","id":38852697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODUyNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38852697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580","html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanke580/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanke580/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nThis is a fix for #18431 . The rewrite rule is not redirecting users because of the tight host filter rule. Update the rewrite condition to not only match `mxnet.apache.org`, but reverse it to match all hostname except `mxnet.cdn.apache.org`.\r\n\r\nAccording to Apache Intra team's [response](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20203#comment-17121024),\r\n> Try removing the following condition:\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} mxnet.apache.org\r\nMost of your visits go to mxnet.incubator.apache.org\r\n\r\nBecause we don't know how Apache's server is configured, remove the whole condition could possibly import looping. To safely fix this problem we can first test the updated rewrite

Description ##\r\nThis PR is used to observe failing tests when updating ubuntu_cpu base image to 20.04. With ubuntu 20.04 python 3.8 is used. As described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18380 we should observe various test failures. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-30T01:25:37Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T03:10:26Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T03:10:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"144ba5cc5edafac0f7c5efd5eb8fbd5a94990ec9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove a manually created symbolic link to ninja-build since the newer versions of the package already include one\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-29T15:21:06Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T18:09:15Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T18:09:15Z","merged_at":"2020-05-29T18:09:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"6bcfce9f0a2e7ed2519006275e0456b9e5aa81c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/765b216874179680804a9e7876c2e2f57d118e0f","head":{"label":"nickguletskii:bugfix/remove_centos7_ninja_ln","ref":"bugfix/remove_centos7_ninja_ln","sha":"765b216874179680804a9e7876c2e2f57d118e0f","user":{"login":"nickguletskii","id":786473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/786473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii","html_url":"https://github.com/nickguletskii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":179939195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzk5MzkxOTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"nickguletskii/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickguletskii","id":786473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/786473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii","html_url":"https://github.com/nickguletskii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_

Description ##\r\nThis PR is the part1 of #18422 .To fix slow site speed in China and improve overall loading speed. It adds server side logic to redirect Chinese visitors to Chinese CDN based on Geo IP. This is the most accurate and fastest way to filter visitors.\r\n \r\nThere are 2 checks to each incoming HTTP requests. \r\n1. Check user Geoip country code, whether it equals to `CN` \r\n2. Check host name in URL to ensure redirect only happens when user initially attempts to access the website. Avoid any loops and subsequent redirect.\r\n\r\nIf all conditions match, redirect user to Chinese CDN with same URI. For example, redirect from `https://mxnet.apache.org/features` to `https://mxnet.cdn.apache.org/features`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add logic to redirect Chinese visitors to Apache's Chinese CDN provider\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Preview: http://ec2-34-219-134-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\r\n- Please note: Geo_ip is set up on this preview server. If you visit `http://ec2-34-219-134-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/testgeoip.php`, you should see your ip and geolocation data.\r\nFollowing settings are used to stimulate the process:\r\n```shell\r\nRewriteCond %{ENV:GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE} ^CN$\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ec2-34-219-134-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*) https://mxnet.cdn.apache.org%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]\r\n```\r\n- Tested by several users in China, redirect works properly and there is a boost of loading speed\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-28T23:37:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T22:54:39Z","closed_at":"2020-05-30T20:39:02Z","merged_at":"2020-05-30T20:39:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"53a92f9d6dd0045227bd39d6a899e66ff7f75266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-28T08:18:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T07:31:25Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T07:31:17Z","merged_at":"2020-06-02T07:31:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c59a3255346ebe9bc0729c5a702fc99624ed2374","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5ced1729eb678231cef4f3664c4bf727e6627a3a","head":{"label":"yijunc:fix_issue_18299","ref":"fix_issue_18299","sha":"5ced1729eb678231cef4f3664c4bf727e6627a3a","user":{"login":"yijunc","id":16834420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM0NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16834420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc","html_url":"https://github.com/yijunc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245949326,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU5NDkzMjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"yijunc/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yijunc","id":16834420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM0NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16834420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc","html_url":"https://github.com/yijunc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijunc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yijunc/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR makes it easy to create unittests that require specific settings of environment variables, while avoiding the pitfalls (discussed in comments section).   This PR can be considered a recasting and expansion of the great vision of @larroy in creating the EnvManager class in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13140.\r\n\r\nIn its base form, the facility is a drop-in replacement for EnvManager, and is called 'environment':\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith environment('MXNET_MY_NEW_FEATURE', '1'):\r\n    <test with feature enabled>\r\nwith environment('MXNET_MY_NEW_FEATURE', '0'):\r\n    <test with feature disabled>\r\n```\r\nLike EnvManager, this facility takes care of the save/restore of the previous environment variable state, including when exceptions are raised.  In addition though, this PR introduces the features:\r\n\r\n- A similarly-named unittest decorator: `@with_environment(key, value)`\r\n- The ability to pass in multiple env vars as a dict (as is needed for some tests) in both forms, so for example:\r\n```\r\nwith environment({'MXNET_FEATURE_A': '1',\r\n                  'MXNET_FEATURE_B': '1'}):\r\n    <test with both features enabled>\r\n```\r\n- Works on Windows!  This PR includes a wrapping of the backend's setenv() and getenv() functions, and uses this direct access to the backend environment to keep it in sync with the python environment.  This works around the problem that the C Runtime on Windows gets a snapshot of the Python environment at startup that is immutable from Python.  \r\n- `with environment()` has a simple implementation using the @contextmanager decorator\r\n- Tests are included that validate the facility works with all combinations of before_val/set_val, namely unset/unset, unset/set, set/unset, set/set.\r\n\r\nThere were 5 unittests previously using EnvManager, and this PR shifts those uses to `with environment():`, while converting over 20 other ad-hoc uses of os.environ[] within the unittests.  This PR also enables those unittests that were bypassed on Windows (due to the inability to set environment variables) to run on all platforms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Further Comments ##\r\nEnvironment variables are a two-edged sword- they enable useful operating modes for testing, debugging or niche applications, but like all features they must be tested.  The correct approach for testing with a particular env var setting is:\r\n```\r\ndef set_env_var(key, value):\r\n    if value is None:\r\n        os.environ.pop(key, None)\r\n    else:\r\n        os.environ[key] = value\r\n\r\nold_env_var_value = os.environ.get(env_var_name)\r\ntry:\r\n    set_env_var(env_var_name, test_env_var_value)\r\n    <perform test>\r\nfinally:\r\n    set_env_var(env_var_name, old_env_var_value )\r\n```\r\nThe above code makes no assumption about whether the before-test and within-test state of the env var is set or unset, and restores the prior environment even if the test raises an exception.  This represents a lot of boiler-plate code that could be potentially mishandled.  The `with environment()` context makes it simple to handle all this properly.  If an entire unittest wants a forced env var setting, then using the `@with_environment()` decorator avoids the code indent of the `with environment()` approach if used otherwise within the test.\r\n

Description ##\r\nIn the current version of KLDivLoss, the return value is not the same value calculated by SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss, which is not documented. It may due to the incorrect settings which using mean rather than sum dealing with the return value.\r\nI provide a fix of this setting, which will keep the return value of `KLDivLoss` and `SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss` almost the same when `from_logits=False` and `sparse_label=False` are set to these functions seperately.\r\nNow, the behave of KLDivLoss is exactly the same to what the document say.\r\n\r\nto reproduce the misbehave in the current master branch:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\na=mx.nd.array([[-1,1],[1,-1]])\r\nb=mx.nd.array([1,0]).one_hot(2)\r\nTrueLoss=mx.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss(sparse_label=False)\r\nFalseLoss=mx.gluon.loss.KLDivLoss(from_logits=False)\r\nc=TrueLoss(a,b)\r\nd=FalseLoss(a,b)*a.shape[-1]\r\nassert((c-d).abs().sum()==0 and a.shape[-1]==2)\r\n```\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nIn recommendation, there appear many features: \r\n- dense features, for instance, ctr, item exposure, item click, item statis features, etc.\r\n- one-hot categorical features, for instance, user's network, user's gender, item_id to score\r\n- mulit-hot categorical features, for instance, user profiles which describes interest, and there exists much interests for a user. So the length of the multi-hot categorical features is variable.\r\nThe sample can be as followed.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5248288/82135079-33513180-9831-11ea-92a4-83b6fe0d8aba.png)\r\nThe row is splited by ^A(\\001). There are five columns. The first column is label, supporting multi labels. And the second column is dense feature, and the third column is categorical feature, and the the fourth column is multi-hot categorical feature which can be splited by comma , and the fifth column is sparse feature which is support wide input for google wide and deep model. \r\n\r\nThe sample contains many formated features which are storaged by csv or sparse. So it is complicated. To high performance parse the sample, i implent c++ DataIter. Train at gpu will not be hold back by cpu parsing sample.\r\n\r\nIn the meantimes, part code of dmlc-core is mended where is in

Once updating the toolchain in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17984 gcc7 is used on CD

Description ##\r\n\r\nA custom Partition API backend may add new parameters or delete during the partitioning.\r\n\r\nIn the Gluon API, the CachedOp needs to received a list of the same size as the number input nodes in the graph. Not deleting the args/aux after partitioning was causing the CachedOp to fail.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Sym: reflects the deletion of parameters in the arg and aux dicts. \r\n- Gluon: refactor `_build_cache` to allow `_cached_op_args` (the list of parameters passed to the CachedOp) to contain only the subset of parameters needed (excluding the ones deleted by the optimization) from the Block parameters and the ones created during the optimization. The original parameters are not deleted from Block, and _cached_op_args only references the Parameters needed by the model.","created_at":"2020-05-26T11:18:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T19:59:02Z","closed_at":"2020-07-13T18:45:30Z","merged_at":"2020-07-13T18:45:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c5b95a9c5d6f83a067504fb47fac4e3aed27e81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/milestones/5/labels","id":5800994,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTgwMDk5NA==","number":5,"title":"v1.8.0","description":"Tracker
