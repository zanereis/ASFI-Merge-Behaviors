(This suite was moved to precommit in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7539)\r\n2) Python 3.5 VR Flink suite that we run in **post**-commit.\r\n\r\nThanks @fredo838 for initial https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8877 suggesting these changes. As noted in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8877, VR Flink suite is resource-consuming. Therefore, this PR adds only one Python 3.x suite, places it in a separate Jenkins Job, and runs it in postcommit. \r\n\r\nIf deemed necessary, we can add other 3.x suites later, and/or move Python 3 suite(s) to precommit.  \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a new option --job_server_timeout that default to 60 seconds. The request timeout is user for all job server requests (with exception to the ones that are expected to last long or hang). The request timeout is also used upon channel creation so that the Beam driver will fail if the job server is not available.\r\n\r\nLet me know if the option name looks fine or it needs renaming. Finally, there are other grpc requests (non job service) that I'm not covering as part of this pr. Let me know if I should add the timeout to those as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The more CPU constrained a job is, the faster avro becomes.\r\n\r\nMy test dataset is a typical workload of ours, around 2 billion records (~130 GB serialized) representing the result of a combine.  My tests read these records from GCS and wrote them to BigQuery.  The jobs were run in dataflow with 150 x n1-standard-2 workers.\r\n\r\nformat | time to start load job | bytes written | BQ slot time (ms)\r\n-------|----------------------|--------------|-------------\r\navro    |  6 m 30 s                     | 126 GB          | 35,189,679\r\njson    |  8 m 5 s                        |  712 GB         | 96,006,088\r\n\r\n@lukecwik @chamikaramj looks like you guys are the OWNERS of the gcp IO module.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

the code of the last example with the explanation which folows it.\r\n\r\n- the text refers to `model.update()` while it was `model.add()` in the code (both Java and Pyhton)\r\n- the Python snippet called `add()` on `model_state` instead of `model`, and `model_state.write()` was missing\r\n- in the text, parameters of some method calls are omitted (shown as the ellipsis) while there is only one parameter per call, so one could simply put it there\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

subtle Off By One error when splitting from a DataSource, likely caused by using an ambiguous count, rather than an index. This change renames the ambiguous variable and improves the comments around splitting to clarify that the returned split is the first element of the residual (and not the last element of the primary). \r\nThe fix is starting the bundle's index from -1 to mark a \"before processing has begun\", and then incrementing normally from there, so that the first received element has a 0 index.\r\n\r\nAlso resolves the follow on ambiguity of the OutputElementCount when providing bundle progress. This value is the number of \"completely processed elements\", which tracks the index. eg. When processing index 0 (the first element), 0 elements have been completely processed. When processing index 5, 5 elements have been completely processed, and so on.\r\nAfter a bundle is complete, in both the split and unsplit cases, an additional increment occurs, making the index accurately reflect the count at the end of a bundle. In the case of splitting, the increment func is how the bundle processing exits, while for unsplit cases, it's the ordinary EOF of the data which indicates no further elements exist.\r\n\r\nAdds a battery of tests around splitting to help avoid this in the future, though there are no tests validating \"during\" processing at this time since those are inherently race condition inducing, and would require a better harness to check that.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Flink version <= 1.5 the Flink Runner had to buffer any elements which are\r\nemitted during a snapshot because the barrier has already been emitted.\r\n\r\nFlink version >= 1.6 provides a hook to execute an action before the snapshot\r\nbarrier is emitted by the operator. We can remove the buffering in favor of\r\nfinishing the current bundle in the DoFnOperator's prepareSnapshotPreBarrier.\r\n\r\nThis had previously been deferred (#7940) until removal of Flink 1.5

Since the Flink community only supports the last two Flink releases, it is now time to drop at least 1.5 and 1.6.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, we will get rid of Flink 1.5/1.6 specific workarounds, e.g. make use of Flink's preSnapshotBarrier in AbstractStreamOperator which removes the needs to buffer elements during a snapshot.\r\n\r\nBuild time should decrease by several minutes.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit

Added the pipeline_instrument module to automatically instrument a\r\ngiven Interactive Beam pipeline by mutating it with additional cache\r\nbased PTransforms if available so that, within an interactive\r\nenvironment, each pipeline run could have effect against the future\r\nruns to provide an interactive experience when executing Beam\r\npipelines.\r\n2. The pipeline_instrument module will replace pipeline_analyzer module\r\nwhen the integration with a re-written of display module interfaces is\r\ndone since the interactivity instrument (i.e., parameters passed and\r\nused) has changed. Most of the display logic won't change.\r\n3. An optional pruning logic is marked as TODO so that when executing\r\nan instrumented pipeline, any sub graph doesn't generate new states\r\nshould not be re-executed if implemented.\r\n4. Tests included.\r\n5. The philosophy is to keep the pipeline instance defined by user code\r\nintact and mutate directly on a copied pipeline instance; to always\r\nconvert the instrumented pipeline to a portable pipeline and pass it\r\nto runner for execution; to maintain the mapping relationship from\r\noriginal user defined pipeline to instrumented copied pipeline instances\r\nand jobs executed by runners.\r\n6. Additional complexity occurs when there are multiple pipeline\r\ninstances defined in user code, multiple runners instantiated, and\r\nmultiple jobs running from those pipeline instances by the runner\r\ninstances. Currently, the only guarantee is that a pipeline result\r\nbounded to a job must be the return of a run by a runner and originate\r\nfrom a pipeline instance. Some design change proposals are marked as TODO\r\naround the cache scoping to solve the context problem in interactive\r\nenvironment: when and what to instrument when the additional complexity\r\noccurs.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
