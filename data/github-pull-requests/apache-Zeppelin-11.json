What is this PR for?\r\nTravis-CI:\r\n - remove all environment variables from the build matrix, to use the same cache for all jobs\r\n - activate the mysql service only when this service is needed\r\n - activate the xvfb service, when is necessary and possible\r\n - removed Bower Caching to remove too many complicated lines in Travis-ci\r\n - Giving the test names\r\n - Installing R only once with conda, previously it was installed twice with 'testing/install_R.sh' and 'testing/install_external_dependencies.sh\r\n - remove the R-Cache, because the installation with conda is quite fast\r\n - Delete 'test/install_R.sh' because it is no longer used\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n - Ignore the tests in 'HeliumApplicationFactoryTest.java' to get the JUnit tests running in the IDE + remove exclude in 'travis.yml\r\n - Remove deprecation warning in maven-surefire-plugin\r\n - Helium works better with an absolute path, because a relative path in PATH, is not a good idea for local testing\r\n - Remove JVM language dependent asserts\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n*

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently its hard to integrate certain plotting libraries in one single zeppelin notebook efficiently. efficiently here means in the sense of how often library code needs to be embedded into a single notebook. while few plotting libraries provide APIs to properly enable lazy loading of their JS library (e.g. bokeh), others do not (e.g. plotly), which results in large overhead in notebooks with couple of plots, where each plot embeds the library code again and again. attempts to only embed library code in the first paragraph is not feasible, as its not guaranteed, that this paragraph will be loaded at first by the browser. Any attempt to load libraries via paragraph code will end up in such synchronization issues when the library does not support synchronization on its own.\r\n\r\nA general solution for that problem is to enable the loading of 3rd party JS libraries within the root HTML.\r\n\r\nHence this issue will introduce a new optional zeppelin configuration that allows administrators to add global addons to the zeppelin root HTML, so analysts can rely on that the JS library is already loaded for every paragraph.\r\n\r\nAs there exist two places in HTML where initial loading may be placed, the issue will introduce the following two configuration properties:\r\n\r\n- `zeppelin.server.html.head.addon` > addon html code to be placed at the end of the html->head section \r\n- `zeppelin.server.html.body.addon` > addon html code to be placed at the end of the html->body section\r\n\r\nEach property may contain any valid HTML code, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script defer src=\"https://url/to/my/lib.min.js\" /><script defer src=\"https://url/to/other/lib.min.js\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5019\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Unit Test added for index.html of `zeppelin-web`\r\n* can also be manually tested by adding config properties mentioned above. Then check the resulting source of the zeppelin web application (old and new ui)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? yes\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-27T15:08:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-04T06:09:47Z","closed_at":"2020-09-04T06:09:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8efc3ab38f92ca9f53809b180fdb9a70afd8a925","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/29e7a022200dec0e9518950f70c44277f908694b","head":{"label":"weand:ZEPPELIN-5019","ref":"ZEPPELIN-5019","sha":"29e7a022200dec0e9518950f70c44277f908694b","user":{"login":"weand","id":1639457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1639457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand","html_url":"https://github.com/weand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62639819,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjYzOTgxOQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"weand/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weand","id":1639457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1639457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand","html_url":"https://github.com/weand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weand/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nNow we have an updated container. Unfortunately, dependencies are broken:\r\n\r\n* We can't upgrade to CentOS 7, because scripts are incompatible with systemd\r\n* New Spark requires JDK 8\r\n* Java is located on a different fs

issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5006\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nTry to manually build and run the spark-yarn dockerfile.\r\n\r\nIn the current version of the dockerfile builds ok, but fails immediately after starting:\r\nYou can check it by inspecting Spark and sshd - they are not running.\r\n\r\nAfter this pull request everything is OK.\r\n\r\n###

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR provides an instant visual feedback to improve user experience on high latency network environment.\r\nIt focuses on improving 2 frequent user action\r\n\r\n - Run paragraph(s)\r\n - Swich visualization\r\n\r\nIn high latency network, the user may feel a short 'freeze' between action (click) and any visual change in notebook.\r\nWhile the paragraph is updated after get a response from server. \r\n\r\nAfter this change, the paragraph will get immediate update after a user action, without waiting for server response.\r\n\r\n####

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, when the websocket reconnects GET_NOTE is called. The purpose of this call on reconnect is to add the note back to the NoteSocketMap (see discussion here: https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/213).\r\n\r\nHowever, GET_NOTE also does two other things:\r\n1. It retrieves the note from storage and\r\n2. Sends that note back to the browser where it is redrawn.\r\n\r\nDoing this causes issues for our users:\r\n1. The retrieval of the note means that any work done since the note was last saved will be lost. Notes save often, but we've had users complain about this.\r\n2. The redraw causes the cursor to jump back to the beginning of the line.\r\n3. In our environment, the redraw causes the notebook to scroll down.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new request that will be called instead of GET_NOTE. The purpose of this new request is to simply put the note back into the NoteSocketMap so that we can continue working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Open a notebook, wait for the websocket to reconnect, ensure that you can still do everything you should be able to do.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T17:22:05Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T18:34:22Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T18:05:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e3b3ae720ff01bdf13419e78f460c6e514a1d0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4bb847423d8fba68642b96381f5cc70694b1ff9a","head":{"label":"jason-ogaard:master","ref":"master","sha":"4bb847423d8fba68642b96381f5cc70694b1ff9a","user":{"login":"jason-ogaard","id":3477027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzcwMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3477027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard","html_url":"https://github.com/jason-ogaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jason-ogaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ab47b29393757a0179fd276dc5fc4d790f3940ae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR provides new Dockerfiles to build a Zeppelin server and interpreter image. This PR tries to solve https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3769#discussion_r434610135\r\nI agree with @alexott that multiple interpreter images are difficult to handle. Currently neither the docker launcher nor the K8s launcher support switching to other interpreter images.\r\n\r\nSome motivations:\r\n - conda is used to install all needed python and R packages \r\n   - conda is able to manage a whole environment and both languages\r\n - files are used for installing python and R dependency\r\n   - it's easy to customize the content of files. No need to change the Dockerfile itself.\r\n   - a file has more readability\r\n   - reduce dependency calculation\r\n - a zeppelin-distribution image is needed\r\n   - you need to build Zeppelin only once, if you want to build new images in parallel on a build cluster\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4978\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build the images\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-20T14:55:37Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T08:24:17Z","closed_at":"2020-08-24T16:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18b9a09759b886cd1ff954767cf100c5d097a614","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/300fc0c18ed980e61d98c07ed93a4669141deeb4","head":{"label":"Reamer:three_images","ref":"three_images","sha":"300fc0c18ed980e61d98c07ed93a4669141deeb4","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203154995,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxNTQ5OTU=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Reamer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nRight now, Cassandra interpreter is very restrictive & allows execution only of the predefined set of the commands, and this doesn't allow to execute CQL commands that are extension of the core of CQL.

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR provides Kotlin interpreter users with the new version of scripting compiler (1.4) which results in following:\r\n- Users may use new features of Kotlin 1.4.\r\n- Compile times are significantly reduced for big notebooks: some performance issues in scripting compiler resolution were fixed.\r\n- Completion feature is now natively supported by REPL compiler, and it's a way more smart.\r\n- Interpreter itself and notebook scripts dependencies were splitted into different submodules.\r\n- Implicit receivers logic was transformed to a new base-class logic.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n- [ ] - Check and fix tests for Kotlin Spark interpreter\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ZEPPELIN/issues/ZEPPELIN-4905\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Travis CI build: https://travis-ci.org/github/ileasile/zeppelin/builds/705291140\r\n* Check unit tests for Kotlin and KotlinSpark interpreters\r\n* Check that script dependencies specified for Kotlin interpreter are availible in notebook cells\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n**No.**\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n**Yes.** Kotlin itself has breaking changes in 1.4: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT?q=Tag:%20language-committee-approved%20Target%20versions:%201.4-M1,%201.4-M2,%201.4-M3,%201.4.0%20%23Fixed%20&_ga=2.173677219.12913552.1593942860-2018140051.1491349376\r\nAlso, some minor changes were made in scripting REPL itself:\r\n  * `InvokeWrapper` was moved to another package (`org.apache.zeppelin.kotlin.script.InvokeWrapper`) which may break the notebooks which use it\r\n  * Internal variables like `kc` are now not shown in the list of all variables.\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n**No.** Existing documentation is enough.","created_at":"2020-07-05T08:46:04Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T10:13:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3840/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3840/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3840/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/338058ecabe3fc7f0bd47943f5f19e7c9ee9d122","head":{"label":"ileasile:kotlin-interpreter-new-api","ref":"kotlin-interpreter-new-api","sha":"338058ecabe3fc7f0bd47943f5f19e7c9ee9d122","user":{"login":"ileasile","id":20319593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzE5NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20319593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile","html_url":"https://github.com/ileasile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":220506393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjA1MDYzOTM=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"ileasile/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ileasile","id":20319593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzE5NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20319593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile","html_url":"https://github.com/ileasile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ileasile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ileasile/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen S3NotebookRepo saves a notebook into S3 it does so without granting the bucket owner full control of the object, this means that owning AWS account cannot read the notebook, only the creating AWS account. This causes issues when a notebook bucket is shared across AWS accounts.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the configuration value \"zeppelin.notebook.s3.cannedAcl\" which\r\nwill override the default object permissions when saving a notebook to S3. This allows\r\ngranting the bucket owner full control when the writer and the bucket owner are\r\ndifferent AWS accounts.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement/Feature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - N/A\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4896\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n#### Unit-Tests\r\nUnfortunately Unit-Tests are not possible as gaul.S3Proxy does not support Object ACL throwing a NotImplemented exception if you attempt to use PutRequest.withCannedAcl for any value other than public or private (see https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy#limitations).\r\n\r\n#### Manual Testing\r\n1. Have two AWS accounts, \"account-a\" and \"account-b\"\r\n2. Create a bucket \"notebook-bucket\" in \"account-a\" and grant \"account-b\" permissions to write to it\r\n3. Setup zeppelin-site.xml for S3NotebookRepor WITHOUT Canned ACL Feature and AWS Credentials for \"account-b\"\r\n4. Launch zeppelin, create a new note titled 'WithoutACL', and shutdown zeppelin\r\n5.
