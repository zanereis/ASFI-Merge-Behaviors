What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade `labeler action` from v4 to v5.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe full release notes: https://github.com/actions/labeler/releases/tag/v5.0.0\r\nVersion 5 of this action updated the [runtime to Node.js 20](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions). All scripts are now run with Node.js 20 instead of Node.js 16 and are affected by any breaking changes between Node.js 16 and 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually check:\r\n   1.Considering that the testing of the `github labeler action` is relatively special: When I submitted changes to this repo, the GA still executed the v4 version logic before merging the PR into it\r\n   ref: https://github.com/actions/labeler?tab=readme-ov-file#notes-regarding-pull_request_target,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- fix potential bug(ie: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44208) and enhance user experience.\r\n- make the code more compliant with standards\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe use the local maven repo as the first-level cache in ivy.  The original intention was to reduce the time required to parse and obtain the ar, but when there are corrupted files in the local maven repo,The above mechanism will be directly interrupted and the prompt is very unfriendly, which will greatly confuse the user.  Based on the original intention, we should skip the cache directly in similar situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently SparkListenerApplicationEnd only has a timestamp value and there is not exit status recorded with it.\r\nThis change will exitcode to the SparkListenerApplicationEnd event.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this it is hard to understand whether an attempt has failed or succeeded when using spark listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the added exitCode is an optional parameter of the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocally using the normal tests. also anew tests is added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- I created `SparkException.require` which is the same as the Scala `require` precondition except it uses `SparkIllegalArgumentException`.\r\n- I changed 2 `require`s to use this `SparkException.require` in `ComplexTypeMergingExpression`\r\n- The exception message was updated for these `require`s\r\n- A SQLState error was added for the `require`s in `ComplexTypeMergingExpression`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll user facing exceptions should be `SparkException`s. The `require`s need to be changed to match this convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n- `ComplexTypeMergingExpression throws a `SparkIllegalArgumentException` instead of `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n- It also updates the SqlState for these\r\n- It also updates the messages associated with the exceptions thrown\r\n- It also updates the docs with the new error classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-13T17:15:47Z","updated_at":"2024-01-21T21:00:16Z","closed_at":"2024-01-21T20:28:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44887f803089e8ac30a5acc711b2349e0b65aeb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c36f2c1dba1536aeff57af2a5966a316cc5945be","head":{"label":"hannahkamundson:SPARK-42332","ref":"SPARK-42332","sha":"c36f2c1dba1536aeff57af2a5966a316cc5945be","user":{"login":"hannahkamundson","id":48397717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzk3NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48397717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson","html_url":"https://github.com/hannahkamundson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717832585,"node_id":"R_kgDOKslBiQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hannahkamundson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hannahkamundson","id":48397717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzk3NzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48397717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson","html_url":"https://github.com/hannahkamundson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hannahkamundson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hannahkamundson/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to handle exceptions from JDBC drivers in the JDBC table catalog, classify them and converted to appropriate Spark exception w/ an error class. This PR covers the following functions where such errors haven't been classified yet:\r\n- list tables\r\n- namespace exists\r\n- list namespaces\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark exceptions, and migrate onto new error framework.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user code expects that Spark SQL bypass Java exceptions from JDBC drivers.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCTableCatalogSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-13T16:31:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T09:50:26Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T08:01:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e15a3606e1abb92e6a1ea066ecbb516791d1c22d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/309c4fd065fa8822a5ff47da3608f8123533de42","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:classifyException-JDBCTableCatalog","ref":"classifyException-JDBCTableCatalog","sha":"309c4fd065fa8822a5ff47da3608f8123533de42","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the process of initializing the `DB` in `RocksDBProvider/LevelDBProvider`, there is a `checkVersion` step that may throw an exception. After the exception is thrown, the upper-level caller cannot hold the already opened `RockDB/LevelDB` instance, so it cannot perform resource cleanup, which poses a potential risk of handle leakage. So this PR manually closes the `RocksDB/LevelDB` instance when `checkVersion` throws an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nShould close the `RocksDB/LevelDB` instance when `checkVersion` throw Exception\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-12-13T05:45:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T01:54:53Z","closed_at":"2023-12-17T21:22:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3802b0f939f5b4a635af7a2eee579175ac0fbb1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae2541cc40f5c45c3de3d25f274a486387598786","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-46389","ref":"SPARK-46389","sha":"ae2541cc40f5c45c3de3d25f274a486387598786","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn these changes, we modify the stream-stream state removal logic to trigger and drop state for one side of a stream-stream join by looking for the existence of a watermark on the _other_ stream.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we check whether to drop state for side `A` only  if there exists a watermark on side `A`. However, that is not a correct condition: state removal from one side of stream, in a stream-stream join, should happens when there exists a watermark on the _other_ side (and a time-interval condition).\r\n\r\nIf we have the time interval condition `L > R + 10`, the minimum value of `L` event-times that we need to hold onto is `min(R + 10)`, and we can drop all state from the left that is _less_ than that quantity. Distributing, we see that it is `min(R) + min(10)`, which is `min(R) + 10`. `min(R)` is the watermark of R. So, we should always check whether there exists a watermark on `R` to drop state from `L`.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that our state watermark removal predicate is wrong. It's actually correct. The mistake in our implementation is that the predicate we run to decide whether to apply state removal is wrong. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nWithout these changes (i.e. against current Spark master), all the state assertions about removal would fail, i.e. these lines: [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44323/files#diff-a271c249e6989ebaad63a491910597cd336049516e5b8e9a80f2bbd7368f458dR318), [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44323/files#diff-a271c249e6989ebaad63a491910597cd336049516e5b8e9a80f2bbd7368f458dR328), [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44323/files#diff-a271c249e6989ebaad63a491910597cd336049516e5b8e9a80f2bbd7368f458dR1085).\r\n\r\nYou might ask, why didn't we catch this before? Why didn't our current unit tests catch this? It's because all of our unit tests use two watermarks. We never before had a test with 2 streams that used just one watermark, even though in our documentation we say that watermarking both sides if \"optional\". \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-13T00:57:19Z","updated_at":"2024-08-24T00:20:49Z","closed_at":"2024-08-24T00:20:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acae80dd9340e1618459eda6970a578cb3e6d8c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

For a stage with a large number of tasks (**_O(100k)_**), we saw **30%** of the heap usage stemming from `TaskInfo.accumulables()`.\r\n\r\n  \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/10495099/13ef5d07-abfc-47fd-81b6-705f599db011)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `TaskSetManager` today keeps around the TaskInfo objects ([ref1](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c1ba963e64a22dea28e17b1ed954e6d03d38da1e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L134), [ref2](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c1ba963e64a22dea28e17b1ed954e6d03d38da1e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L192))) and in turn the task metrics (`AccumulableInfo`) for every task attempt until the stage is completed. This means that for stages with a large number of tasks, we keep metrics for all the tasks (`AccumulableInfo`) around even when the task has completed and its metrics have been aggregated. Given a task has a large number of metrics, stages with many tasks end up with a large heap usage in the form of task metrics.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an opt-in change (disabled by default) to reduce the driver's heap usage for stages with many tasks by no longer referencing the task metrics of completed tasks. Once a task is completed in `TaskSetManager`, we no longer keep its metrics around. Upon task completion, we clone the `TaskInfo` object and empty out the metrics for the clone. The cloned `TaskInfo` is retained by the `TaskSetManager` while the original `TaskInfo` object with the metrics is sent over to the `DAGScheduler` where the task metrics are aggregated. Thus for a completed task, `TaskSetManager` holds a `TaskInfo` object with empty metrics. This reduces the memory footprint by ensuring that the number of task metric objects is proportional to the number of active tasks and not to the total number of tasks in the stage.\r\n\r\n### Config to gate changes\r\nThe changes in the PR are guarded with the Spark conf `spark.scheduler.dropTaskInfoAccumulablesOnTaskCompletion.enabled` which can be used for rollback or staged rollouts. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes disabled by default?\r\nThe PR introduces a breaking change wherein the `TaskInfo.accumulables()` are empty for `Resubmitted` tasks upon the loss of an executor. Read https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44321#pullrequestreview-1785137821 for details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce driver's heap usage, especially for stages with many tasks\r\n\r\n## Benchmarking\r\nOn a cluster running a scan stage with 100k tasks, the TaskSetManager's heap usage dropped from 1.1 GB to 37 MB. This  **reduced the total driver's heap usage by 38%**, down to 2 GB from 3.5 GB.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/assets/10495099/7c1599f3-3587-48a1-b019-84115b1bb90d)\r\n**WITH FIX**\r\n<img width=\"1386\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/databricks/runtime/assets/10495099/b85129c8-dc10-4ee2-898d-61c8e7449616\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn XML, elements typically consist of a name and a value, with the value enclosed between the opening and closing tags. But XML also allows to include arbitrary values interspersed between these elements. To address this, we provide an option named `valueTags`, which is enabled by default, to capture these values. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ROW>\r\n    <a>1</a>\r\n  value1\r\n  <b>\r\n    value2\r\n    <c>2</c>\r\n    value3\r\n  </b>\r\n</ROW>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `<a>`, `<b>`, and `<c>` are named elements with their respective values enclosed within tags. There are arbitrary values value1 value2 value3 interspersed between the elements. Please note that there can be multiple occurrences of values in a single element (i.e. there are value2, value3 in the element `<b>`)\r\n\r\n \r\nWe should parse the values between tags into the valueTags field. If there are multiple occurrences of value tags, the value tag field will be converted to an array type.\r\n\r\n<b>We will simplify the handling of value tags in a follow-up PR.\r\n1) As value tags only exist in structure data, their handling will be confined to the `inferObject` method, eliminating the need for processing in `inferField`. This implies that when we encounter non-whitespace characters, we can invoke `inferObject`. For structures with a single primitive field, we'll simplify them into primitive types.\r\n2) The `inferAndCheckEndElement` function will be updated to align with this approach. If we encounter an opening tag in the first place, we will peek at the next element of the closing tag. If not, we will stop at the closing tag right away.</b>\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe should parse the values otherwise there would be data loss\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Seq.","created_at":"2023-12-12T15:17:37Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T13:46:30Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T13:45:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c52fee13b474305acc71edce0e910f061e16f66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith this PR proposal is to do inline table resolution in two phases:\r\n1) If there are no expressions that depend on current context (e.g. expressions that depend on CURRENT_DATABASE, CURRENT_USER, CURRENT_TIME etc.) they will be evaluated as part of ResolveInlineTable rule.\r\n2) Expressions that do depend on CURRENT_* evaluation will be kept as expressions and they evaluation will be delayed to post analysis phase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to solve two problems with inline tables.\r\n\r\nExample1:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ct) FROM VALUES\r\n(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()),\r\n(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()),\r\n(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) as data(ct)\r\n```\r\nPrior to this change this example would return 3 (i.e. all CURRENT_TIMESTAMP expressions would return different value since they would be evaluated individually as part of inline table evaluation). After this change result is 1.\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE VIEW V as (SELECT * FROM VALUES(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\r\n```\r\nIn this example VIEW would be saved with literal evaluated during VIEW creation. After this change CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() will eval during VIEW execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nSee section above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew test that validates this behaviour is introduced.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357, #36889, #38209, #39755, #41120 and #42684.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate the rest two sub-classes of `AnalysisException` onto error classes:\r\n- NonEmptyNamespaceException\r\n- ExtendedAnalysisException\r\n\r\nand forbid raising of such exception without an error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of the migration on the error framework, and unifying errors in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user's code depends on the format of error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the parent class of `UnresolvedException` from `AnalysisException` to `SparkException` with the error class `INTERNAL_ERROR`. If an user observes the error, this is definitely a bug in the compiler.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify all Spark exceptions, and assign an error class. So, this should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, users shouldn't face to the error in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing GAs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-12T09:09:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T03:04:21Z","closed_at":"2023-12-12T15:06:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e43e2c1a1d9d75c26160f2b919f02172cc12fea4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/30ccab2aad6eb11e95a9628cd7fea13b7d71ec44","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:error-class-UnresolvedException","ref":"error-class-UnresolvedException","sha":"30ccab2aad6eb11e95a9628cd7fea13b7d71ec44","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33397 to avoid sub-optimal plans. After converting `Aggregate` to `Project`, there is information lost: `Aggregate` doesn't care about the data order of inputs, but `Project` cares. `EliminateSorts` can remove `Sort` below `Aggregate`, but it doesn't work anymore if we convert `Aggregate` to `Project`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by tagging the `Project` to be order-irrelevant if it's converted from `Aggregate`. Then `EliminateSorts` optimizes the tagged `Project`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid sub-optimal plans\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is same as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44233 but does not use `V1Table` but the original DSv2 interface by reusing UDTF execution code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for Python Data Source to be able to be used in all other place including SparkR, Scala together.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users can register their Python Data Source, and use them in SQL, SparkR, etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and manually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCloses #44269\r\nCloses #44233\r\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `kill` hyperlink from `RELAUNCHING` drivers in `MasterPage`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 1.4.0 (SPARK-5495), `RELAUNCHING` drivers have `kill` hyperlinks in the `Completed Drivers` table.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-11 at 1 02 29 PM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/9700541/38f4bf08-efb9-47e5-8a7a-f7d127429012)\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a bug because the driver was already terminated by definition. Newly relaunched driver has an independent ID and there is no relationship with the previously terminated ID.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7db85642600b1e3b39ca11e41d4e3e0bf1c8962b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/DriverState.scala#L27\r\n\r\nIf we clicked the `kill` link, `Master` always complains like the following.\r\n```\r\n23/12/11 21:25:50 INFO Master: Asked to kill driver 202312112113-00000\r\n23/12/11 21:25:50 WARN Master: Driver 202312112113-00000 has already finished or does not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-11T21:20:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T23:06:44Z","closed_at":"2023-12-11T23:05:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"646427753390a88ad6cd2ff4d8fafdae9abd4523","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- Eliminate the need to manually maintain HTML tables for Spark configurations.\r\n- Using the approach introduced here, we also:\r\n  - Ensure that internal configs are not accidentally documented publicly.\r\n  - Ensure that configs are documented publicly just as they are documented in the code.\r\n- Reorganize the sections in the SQL tuning page slightly so that related tuning techniques are clearer.\r\n- Make it possible for users to hyperlink directly to config entries in our documentation.\r\n\r\nThis change enables us to assign the various SQL configs to groups that can then be referenced automatically in our documentation. This will replace the large number of manually maintained HTML tables with references to generated tables.\r\n\r\nFor example, the SQL performance tuning page has a section on data caching that references two configs. They are in an HTML table that has to be [manually maintained][1].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7db85642600b1e3b39ca11e41d4e3e0bf1c8962b/docs/sql-performance-tuning.md?plain=1#L37-L56\r\n\r\nWith this new system, we group the configs in `SQLConf.scala` according to how we'd like to display them in our documentation. For example, we can assign some configs to the `sql-tuning-caching-data` group:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  val COMPRESS_CACHED = buildConf(\"spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compressed\")\r\n    ...\r\n    .withTag(\"sql-tuning-caching-data\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can reference this `sql-tuning-caching-data` config group from within `sql-performance-tuning.md` as follows:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% include_api_gen _generated/config_tables/sql-tuning-caching-data.html %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pulls in an automatically generated HTML table that includes all the configs tagged `sql-tuning-caching-data`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to eliminating the need to manually maintain HTML tables of configs, this PR also fixes some problems with the current documentation:\r\n1. It ensures that internal configs are not accidentally published in the user-facing documentation, because [internal configs do not get exported][exported] to documentation. For example, `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes` is an [internal config][internal], but it is currently documented publicly in the SQL tuning guide.\r\n2. It ensures that the public documentation of a config matches exactly what is written in the code. For example, the public documentation for `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` is [missing][missing] the following line that is [in the code][in-the-code]:\r\n    > and file-based data source tables where the statistics are computed directly on the files of data.\r\n\r\n[exported]:

config in the generated HTML tables, so that people can link directly to specific configurations in the documentation.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the work done in #27459, and is related to the work done in #28274.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes Spark configuration documentation much easier to maintain and more useful to users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it alters some of the user-facing documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the documentation and viewed it in my browser.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the generated docs: [sql-performance-tuning.html 📸][screenshot]\r\n\r\nI also reviewed the generated documentation for `configuration.html` but didn't screenshot it because it's too long.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n[screenshot]:

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrior to this change `e BETWEEN lower AND upper` expression used to be transformed into `lower <= e && e <= upper`. This means that `e` would be evaluated twice which is problematic from both correctness and performance perspectives.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix is to use `WITH` expression that was introduced with [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/01c294b05f3a9b7bd87cda0ee8b0160f5f58bb24) change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent implementation is not correct for non deterministic expressions, since two calls might return different results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWith this change generated plan for BETWEEN statement will be different. An example of generated plan is provided in tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests plus new test in PlanGenerationTestSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrior to this change `e BETWEEN lower AND upper` expression used to be transformed into `lower <= e && e <= upper`. This means that `e` would be evaluated twice which is problematic from both correctness and performance perspectives.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix is to use `WITH` expression that was introduced with [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/01c294b05f3a9b7bd87cda0ee8b0160f5f58bb24) change.\r\n\r\nOne non-obvious problem was that BETWEEN statement is transformed in IF/ELSE block during AST buildout where all expressions are still in unresolved phase. For CTE creation child type information is needed during `CommonExpressionRef` creation which is not available at this point. Proposed solution is to delay CTE introduction through `RuntimeReplaceable` until type of expression is known, which is enforced through new analysis rule. I am looking for feedback whether there is a cleaner way to do this. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent implementation is not correct for non deterministic expressions, since two calls might return different results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWith this change generated plan for BETWEEN statement will be different. An example of generated plan is provided in tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests plus new test in PlanGenerationTestSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T15:46:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T16:02:24Z","closed_at":"2023-12-11T16:02:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPush down calculations in Aggregate through Expand, so the expressions will only be evaluated once.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n \r\nAgg(grouping, sum($a + $b)) <= Expand <= Project, if $a and $b comes from the Project,\r\n \r\na + b will be pushed down to the Project:\r\n\r\nAgg(grouping, sum(\"a + b\")) <= Expand <= Project(old projections ++ ($a + $b).as(\"a + b\"))\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptimize Aggregate operator, before this PR, complex expressions in Aggregate will be evaluated multiple times,  after this PR, those expressions that are pushed down will be evaluated only once.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n(1)\r\nIn Ray on spark, we want to support loading Ray data from arbitrary spark Dataframe with in-memory conversion,\r\n\r\nfor Ray on spark, Ray datasource read-task runs as child process of Ray worker node, and in Ray on spark, we launch Ray worker node as child process of pyspark UDF worker.\r\n\r\nSo that the above proposed API allows descendent python process of pyspark UDF worker to read a chunk data of given spark dataframe, based on this, we can achieve efficient \"spark DataFrame\" to \"Ray dataset\" conversion.\r\n\r\nThis is Ray side datasource PR https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/41858\r\n(2)\r\nFor spark torch distributor, we want to implement an efficient `Torch DataLoader` that loads data from spark dataframe without saving spark dataframe to cloud storage. This API makes it feasible. This issue has a similar pattern to use-case (1)\r\n\r\n(3)\r\nFor petastorm spark dataset converter (see https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/06/16/simplify-data-conversion-from-apache-spark-to-tensorflow-and-pytorch.html) , using the added API, we can achieve better performance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. It only adds some python APIs for developers.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to clean outdated items in `.rat-excludes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Some items in the `.rat-excludes` file no longer exist in the Spark code repo, such as `SparkIMain.scala`. Perhaps one day in the future, we may add a file named `SparkIMain.scala` (a new file with the `same file name` as the old file, but with a different meaning) due to some requirements.  However, we did not add the required \"License\" header for this file.  According to the current mechanism, it should pass the `check-license`, but this check may not be our original intention.\r\n- In addition, the `.rat-excludes` file seems to be constantly `adding` entries without a mechanism for `removing` them, which is not healthy for the file itself.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T09:24:11Z","updated_at":"2023-12-26T08:17:10Z","closed_at":"2023-12-26T08:16:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5aa7b034c4faeb44c5d44abca8c3cd424a51920","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/147e0c4c37a7800e559db5b8ff715af2aaa2de1e","head":{"label":"panbingkun:clean_rat-excludes","ref":"clean_rat-excludes","sha":"147e0c4c37a7800e559db5b8ff715af2aaa2de1e","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce `getMessage` to provide a standardized way for users to obtain a concise and clear error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, extracting a simple and informative error message in PySpark was not straightforward. The internal `ErrorClassesReader.get_error_message` method was often used, but for JVM-originated errors not defined in `error_classes.py`, obtaining a succinct error message was challenging.\r\n\r\nThe new `getMessage` API harmonizes error message retrieval across PySpark, leveraging existing JVM implementations to ensure consistency and clarity in the messages presented to the users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces a `getMessage` for directly accessing simplified error messages in PySpark.\r\n\r\n- **Before**: No official API for simplified error messages; excessive details in the error output:\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.utils import AnalysisException\r\n    \r\n    try:\r\n        spark.sql(\"\"\"SELECT a\"\"\")\r\n    except AnalysisException as e:\r\n        str(e)\r\n    # \"[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION] A column, variable, or function parameter with name `a` cannot be resolved.  SQLSTATE: 42703; line 1 pos 7;\\n'Project ['a]\\n+- OneRowRelation\\n\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- **After**: The `getMessage` API provides streamlined, user-friendly error messages:\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.utils import AnalysisException\r\n    \r\n    try:\r\n        spark.sql(\"\"\"SELECT a\"\"\")\r\n    except AnalysisException as e:\r\n        e.getMessage()\r\n    # '[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION] A column, variable, or function parameter with name `a` cannot be resolved.  SQLSTATE: 42703'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR has made the following refactoring to the `verifyResponse` function in `ResponseValidator`:\r\n1. The check condition `response.hasField(field)` is moved before getting `value`, and only when `response.hasField(field)` is true, `value` is obtained, which seems more in line with the existing comments.\r\n2. Removed the `value != \"\"` condition check in the case match, because only when `value.nonEmpty` is true will it enter the `if` branch, and the condition `value.nonEmpty` has already covered the check for `value != \"\"`.\r\n3. The condition check `value != id` is moved inside `case Some(id)`. After the modification, an `IllegalStateException` will still be thrown when the id exists and `value != id`, but `serverSideSessionId` will no longer be reassigned when the id exists and `value == id`.\r\n4. Removed the redundant `toString` operation when reassigning `serverSideSessionId`, because `value` is String type.\r\n5. Removed the No-op `case _` match, because it is unreachable code after the above modifications.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify the condition check in the `verifyResponse`

everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to the project. I welcome any feedback and edits to improve this pull request.\r\n\r\nIssue Addressed:\r\nCurrently, it's possible to create redundant sort expressions in both Scala and Python APIs, leading to potentially incorrect and confusing SQL statements. For example:\r\n\r\nScala:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10).orderBy($\"id\".desc.asc).show()\r\n```\r\nPython:\r\n```python\r\nspark.range(10).orderBy(f.desc('id'), ascending=False).show()\r\n```\r\nSuch usage generates SQL like order by id DESC NULLS LAST DESC NULLS LAST, causing non-descriptive error messages.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis pull request introduces a constraint in the SortOrder class, ensuring that its child cannot be another instance of SortOrder. This change prevents the creation of nested, redundant sort expressions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in PySpark's DataFrame.sort, there's an ascending keyword argument that could conflict with already sorted expressions. I've added an exception handler to generate more descriptive error messages in such cases.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\nA test case has been added to verify that no double ordering occurs after this fix.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your feedback and thank you for considering this contribution.","created_at":"2023-12-10T03:24:58Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T00:19:02Z","closed_at":"2024-03-21T00:19:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15cf8d6aec3e126d17ace478af450993c6b4cce3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0b6fedbe835cc47eeb5644410b6201daab5a076","head":{"label":"hhdri:fix-sort-order","ref":"fix-sort-order","sha":"c0b6fedbe835cc47eeb5644410b6201daab5a076","user":{"login":"hhdri","id":12569315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTY5MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12569315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri","html_url":"https://github.com/hhdri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":729677060,"node_id":"R_kgDOK339BA","name":"spark","full_name":"hhdri/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hhdri","id":12569315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTY5MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12569315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri","html_url":"https://github.com/hhdri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhdri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hhdri/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `Spark Master`'s recovery process to update a worker status from `UNKNOWN` to `ALIVE` when it receives a `RegisterWroker` message from that worker.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis only happens during the recovery.\r\n- `Master` already has the recovered worker information in memory with `UNKNOWN` status.\r\n- `Worker` sends `RegisterWorker` message correctly.\r\n- `Master` keeps its worker status in `UNKNOWN` and informs the worker with `RegisteredWorker` message with `duplicated` flag.\r\n- Since `Worker` received like the following and will not try to reconnect.\r\n```\r\n23/12/09 23:49:57 INFO Worker: Retrying connection to master (attempt # 3)\r\n23/12/09 23:49:57 INFO Worker: Connecting to master ...:7077...\r\n23/12/09 23:50:04 INFO TransportClientFactory: Successfully created connection to master...:7077 after 7089 ms (0 ms spent in bootstraps)\r\n23/12/09 23:50:04 WARN Worker: Duplicate registration at master spark://...\r\n23/12/09 23:50:04 INFO Worker: Successfully registered with master spark://...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `UNKNOWN`-status workers blocks the recovery process and causes a long delay.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bac3492980a3e793065a9e9d511ddf0fb66357b3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/Master.scala#L604-L606\r\n\r\nAfter the delay, master simply kills them all.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bac3492980a3e793065a9e9d511ddf0fb66357b3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/Master.scala#L647-L649\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis case is a little hard to make a unit test.\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to create `AnalysisException` only with an error class by making the constructor with `message` protected. So, in this way only sub-classes can create `AnalysisException` by passing a `message`, but others shall provide an error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by unifying error exceptions: the final goal is all Spark exception should contain an error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since user's code shouldn't throw `AnalysisException` but it can if it depends on error message formats.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *HiveDDLSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-09T15:56:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T05:19:23Z","closed_at":"2023-12-11T22:29:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c622bcc0ad2fecf083b4384891b1a9de5bad1ea4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch updates the document of `CheckpointFileManager.list` method to reflect the fact it is used to return both files and directories to reduce confusion.\r\n\r\nFor the usage like `HDFSMetadataLog` where it assumes returned file status by `list` are all files, we add a filter there to avoid confusing error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`HDFSMetadataLog` takes a metadata path as parameter. When it goes to retrieves all batches metadata, it calls `CheckpointFileManager.list` to get all files under the metadata path. However, currently all implementations of `CheckpointFileManager.list` returns all files/directories under the given path. So if there is a dictionary with name of batch number (a long value), the directory will be returned too and cause trouble when `HDFSMetadataLog` goes to read it.\r\n\r\nActually, `CheckpointFileManager.list` method clearly defines that it lists the \"files\" in a path. That's being said, current implementations don't follow the doc. We tried to make `list` method implementations only return files but some usage (state metadata) of `list` method already break the assumption and they use dictionaries returned by `list` method. So we simply update `list` method document to explicitly define it returns both files/dictionaries. We add a filter in `HDFSMetadataLog` on the file statuses returned by `list` method to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow, Spark upgraded to Java17 which contains many new feature. The text block is a feature released in Java15.\r\nWhen using text blocks, the code looks more concise.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nString timeError = \"Time must be specified as seconds (s), \" +\r\n   \"milliseconds (ms), microseconds (us), minutes (m or min), hour (h), or day (d). \" +\r\n   \"E.g. 50s, 100ms, or 250us.\";\r\n```\r\nCan be changed to.\r\n```\r\nString timeError = \"\"\"\r\n   Time must be specified as seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), microseconds (us), \\\r\n   minutes (m or min), hour (h), or day (d). E.g. 50s, 100ms, or 250us.\"\"\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is a initial one used for discussion and decision-making.\r\nShall we improve and simplify the long string with  java15 text block?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing [JEP 378: Text Blocks](https://openjdk.org/jeps/378) can bring the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- Simplify the task of writing Java programs by making it easy to express strings that span several lines of source code, while avoiding escape sequences in common cases.\r\n- Enhance the readability of strings in Java programs that denote code written in non-Java languages.\r\n- Support migration from string literals by stipulating that any new construct can express the same set of strings as a string literal, interpret the same escape sequences, and be manipulated in the same ways as a string literal.\r\n- Add escape sequences for managing explicit white space and newline control.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-09T04:04:18Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T12:27:45Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T12:27:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad81960db5c4ca7983b68aa2e2f5206a3ca5d52c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a46fafa12165a370fa48d1b55b39654354b2de4","head":{"label":"beliefer:improve_text_block","ref":"improve_text_block","sha":"4a46fafa12165a370fa48d1b55b39654354b2de4","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a general framework to support any user-defined data source (name is not finalized yet) as a v2 source.\r\n\r\nA user-defined data source is a data source defined outside of JVM. For now, it can only be the Python data source. A user-defined data source can use arbitrary query plans to read it. This PR looks up user-defined data sources and turns them into `DataSourceV2Relation` with a fake v2 table. Then there is a rule to turn `DataSourceV2Relation` into the query plan that the user-defined data source needs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnify the code to look up data sources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now people can use python data source in SQL CREATE TABLE.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

is a cherry-pick of #44214 into 3.4 branch.\r\n\r\nFrom the original PR:\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis updates the the behavior of `from_protobuf()` built function when underlying record fails to deserialize.\r\n\r\n  * **Current behvior**:\r\n    * By default, this would throw an error and the query fails. [This part is not changed in the PR]\r\n    * When `mode` is set to 'PERMISSIVE' it returns a non-null struct with each of the inner fields set to null e.g. `{ \"field_a\": null, \"field_b\": null }`  etc.\r\n       * This is not very convenient to the users. They don't know if this was due to malformed record or if the input itself has null. It is very hard to check for each field for null in SQL query (imagine a sql query with a struct that has 10 fields).\r\n\r\n  * **New behavior**\r\n    * When `mode` is set to 'PERMISSIVE' it simply returns `null`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis makes it easier for users to detect and handle malformed records.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, but this does not change the contract. In fact, it clarifies it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Unit tests are updated.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T19:18:48Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T22:42:56Z","closed_at":"2023-12-08T22:40:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9793786edbdd6e100ba3da226c2f7b623ace250","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba9c4ad586af5f2f5ae1e7cf7e6394ff62eaf4a0","head":{"label":"rangadi:protobuf-null-3.4","ref":"protobuf-null-3.4","sha":"ba9c4ad586af5f2f5ae1e7cf7e6394ff62eaf4a0","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd support for a separate key password in addition to the key store password for JKS keys. This is needed for keys which may have a key password in addition to a key store password. We already had this support for the UI SSL support, so for compatibility we should have it here.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't done earlier as I wasn't sure how to implement it but the discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43998#discussion_r1406993411 suggested the right way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese are needed to support users who may have such keys configured.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt\r\n> project network-common\r\n> testOnly\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T18:07:07Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T05:35:56Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T05:35:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eac34418b1c5a3149ffa7c598d6b1c256292eec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c88cf12979036a0c69a4756d70dd5c107768ee4f","head":{"label":"hasnain-db:separate-pw","ref":"separate-pw","sha":"c88cf12979036a0c69a4756d70dd5c107768ee4f","user":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677479521,"node_id":"R_kgDOKGGEYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hasnain-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR moves us a bit closer to removing CodegenFallback class and instead of it relying on RuntimeReplaceable with StaticInvoke.\r\n\r\nIn this PR there are following changes:\r\n- Doing StaticInvoke + RuntimeReplaceable against spark version expression.\r\n- Adding Unevaluable trait for DateTime expressions. These expressions need to be replaced during analysis anyhow so we explicitly forbid eval from being called.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDirection is to get away from CodegenFallback. This PR moves us closer to that destination.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nRunning existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate the `CatalogNotFoundException` exception to the new error class `CATALOG_NOT_FOUND`, improve the format of the exception message, and prohibit creation of the exception without the error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of the migration process onto error classes and new error framework. The changes improve user experience w/ Spark SQL, and make `CatalogNotFoundException` consistent to other Spark exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user's code depends on the error message format of `CatalogNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAllocate enough capacity by columns size for assembling array list of TColumns in TRowSet generation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nArrayLists is created for TColumn value collections in RowSetUtils for TRowSet generation. Currently, they are created with Java's default capacity of 16, rather than by the number of columns, which could cause array copying in assembling each TColumn collection when the column number exceeds the default capacity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nGA tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd an extension called \"ExecutedPlanPrepRule\" to SparkSessionExtensions, which would allow developers to add their own rules(Rule[SparkPlan]) between `plannerStrategy` and executedPlan preparation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe need to add some \"Rule[SparkPlan]\"s at this position because currently, all such rules are present in AQE, which requires users to use AQE and meet the requirements to enter AdaptiveSparkPlanExec. This makes it difficult to implement certain extensions for simple SQLs.\r\n\r\nFor example, adding some new datasource filters for external data sources is challenging. Modifying DataSourceStrategy directly is not conducive to staying in sync with future advancements in the community. Additionally, customizing the Strategy makes it difficult to append new functionalities in an incremental manner. If we define AQE rules, they would not be effective for the simplest 'SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...' statements. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a customizable Rule[SparkPlan] between sparkPlan and executedPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nunit test\r\nSparkSessionExtensionSuite#test(\"SPARK-46240: Support inject executed plan prep rules in
