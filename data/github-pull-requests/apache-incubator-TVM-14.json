to this commit, `Range(0, expr)` would automatically convert `0` to `IntImm(DataType::Int(32), 0)` using the automatic conversion of `int` to `PrimExpr`.  This can result in ranges where the bounds are of different dtypes.  Since this is a common idiom (25 uses of `Range::FromMinExtent(0, expr)` and 49 uses of `Range(0, expr)`), it should be supported rather than forbidden.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds overloads that take `(int, PrimExpr)` arguments for `Range` and `Range::FromMinExtent`.  These overloads convert the first argument to an `IntImm` of the same dtype as the second, and then delegate to the `(PrimExpr, PrimExpr)` overload.","created_at":"2023-10-31T15:16:23Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T15:28:12Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T15:28:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a8a40f951757744c394007114aee6bcd709596a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c04b10cb740590fd5a27c4827a56afc9d711c20f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_range_integer_zero_as_begin","ref":"tir_range_integer_zero_as_begin","sha":"c04b10cb740590fd5a27c4827a56afc9d711c20f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

of Python exceptions across C++ stack frames was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15596.  This commit primarily fixes a typo in the initial implementation, where `Py_IncRef` was used instead of `Py_DecRef`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR resolves errors that were exposed by this typo fix, which caused test failures in `tests/python/unittest/test_crt.py::test_compile_runtime`.  These were due to use of the `Py_IncRef` and `Py_DecRef` functions on threads that hadn't acquired the GIL.

`IRModule` stores those functions inside a hash map `Map<GlobalVar, BaseFunc>`, which is based on pointer equality. This behavior is usually innocent and harmless given many previous workloads only have one \"main\" function as the primary entry point, e.g. a single Relax Function and a bunch of TIR functions. However, it is not true in LLM usecases where `prefill`, `decoding` are both equally important entrypoints, and in those cases, it is possible that the names of generated TIR functions from LegalizeOps are essentially different from each run, which is, again, harmless in basic usecases, but it does make debugging more challenging.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects this behavior by sorting the functions alphabetically by their

PR introduces support for parameter/effect packing.\r\n\r\n**What is parameter packing?** There are two ways to represent weights\r\nas input(s) of Relax functions.\r\n\r\n- Unpacked: each weight is passed in as a separate parameter:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef f(\r\n  ...,\r\n  weight_0: R.Tensor(...),\r\n  weight_1: R.Tensor(...),\r\n  ...,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n- Packed: all weights are packed together as a Relax Tuple and passed in\r\n  as a single parameter:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef f(\r\n  ...,\r\n  weights: R.Tuple((R.Tensor(...), R.Tensor(...))),\r\n  ...,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why support parameter packing?** First of all, currently MLC LLM uses\r\npacked parameter as the default format in its runtime. To align the new\r\n`nn.Module` frontend with the existing behavior, we allow packing as a\r\nnon-default option to be turned on.\r\n\r\nSecond, having a calling convention where the last argument being\r\npacked parameters and the second last being packed effects could help\r\nsimplify many runtime behavior, for example, instructing the generated\r\ncode to skip type checking, etc.\r\n\r\n**How to enable parameter/effect packing?** We allow an extra argument\r\n`$` when creating `nn.spec.MethodSpec`, which is effectively\r\nfine-grained configuration of exported Relax function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel.export_tvm(\r\n    spec={\r\n        \"forward\": {\r\n            \"x\": nn.spec.Tensor([1, model.in_features], \"float32\"),\r\n            \"$\": {\r\n                \"param_mode\": \"packed\", // Configure parameter packing\r\n                \"effect_mode\": \"none\", // Configure effect packing\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15487, this PR introduces `nn.SourceModule` as a subclass of\r\n`nn.ExternModule` to more convenient handling of externally implemented\r\noperators, subgraphs and other components.\r\n\r\n**What is `nn.ExternModule` designed for?** It is a generic design that\r\naccepts any object file (`.o` in Linux) and combines the symbols within\r\ninto TVM-generated shared/static library. This way, TVM-generated\r\nlibrary will be able to call into the symbols in the object files\r\nprovided. For example, calling into `cutlass_fmha` in TVM Relax.\r\n\r\n**What is `nn.SourceModule`?** It is a subclass that builds on top of\r\n`nn.ExternModule`, which helps with a specific case where the external\r\nimplementation is provided as C++/CUDA source code and `SourceModule`\r\ncould conveniently take care of applying a C++/CUDA compiler to convert\r\nit to convert them into object files.\r\n\r\n**C++/CUDA Calling Convention.** An exported symbol should be explicitly\r\ndeclared with macro `TVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC($SYMBOL, $CPP_FUNC)`,\r\nwhile it is recommended to always hide the symbols that we don't wish to\r\nexport. Multiple files should never define the same symbol, otherwise it\r\nis considered as UB.\r\n\r\n**Marks on `nn.Module`.** It is required to define the input/output\r\nshapes and dtypes using `nn.spec.ExternFunctionSpec`. Symbolic/dynamic\r\nshapes are supported, but there are a few limitations to note:\r\n\r\n1) Multi-output is currently not supported, meaning the return value has\r\nto be a single `nn.Tensor`. There is no technical challenge we are aware\r\nof, and we could extend the interface to get it supported in the future\r\nif there's any need.\r\n2) Symbolic dtype is not supported. It means one has to export multiple\r\nsymbols for multiple dtypes even if the compute is mathematically\r\nidentical, e.g. `matmul_f16_f16_f16`, `matmul_f32_f32_f32`. I imagine it\r\ncould be alleviated if customization of dtype deduction is introduced.\r\n\r\n**Example.** Take the C++ code below as an example:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n\\#include <dlpack/dlpack.h>\r\n\\#include <tvm/runtime/packed_func.h>\r\n\\#include <tvm/runtime/data_type.h>\r\n\r\nnamespace {\r\n\r\nint _scalar_add(DLTensor* a, DLTensor* b, DLTensor* c) {\r\n  using namespace tvm::runtime;\r\n  ICHECK(a->ndim == 0);\r\n  ICHECK(b->ndim == 0);\r\n  ICHECK(c->ndim == 0);\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(a->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(b->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(c->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  float* a_data = static_cast<float*>(a->data);\r\n  float* b_data = static_cast<float*>(b->data);\r\n  float* c_data = static_cast<float*>(c->data);\r\n  *c_data = *a_data + *b_data;\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint _test_sym(DLTensor* a, DLTensor* b, DLTensor* c) {\r\n  using namespace tvm::runtime;\r\n  ICHECK(a->ndim == 3);\r\n  ICHECK(b->ndim == 3);\r\n  ICHECK(c->ndim == 4);\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(a->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(b->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  ICHECK(DataType(c->dtype) == DataType::Float(32));\r\n  int x = a->shape[0];\r\n  int y = a->shape[1];\r\n  int z = b->shape[1];\r\n  ICHECK(a->shape[0] == x);\r\n  ICHECK(a->shape[1] == y);\r\n  ICHECK(a->shape[2] == 1);\r\n  ICHECK(b->shape[0] == y);\r\n  ICHECK(b->shape[1] == z);\r\n  ICHECK(b->shape[2] == 5);\r\n  ICHECK(c->shape[0] == x);\r\n  ICHECK(c->shape[1] == y);\r\n  ICHECK(c->shape[2] == z);\r\n  ICHECK(c->shape[3] == 9);\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\nTVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC(ext_scalar_add, _scalar_add);\r\nTVM_DLL_EXPORT_TYPED_FUNC(ext_test_sym, _test_sym);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt exposes two symbols `ext_scalar_add` and `ext_test_sym`. In\r\n`nn.Module`, their shape/dtype deduction rules could be described as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndtype = \"float32\"\r\nfunctions = {\r\n  \"ext_scalar_add\": spec.ExternFunctionSpec(\r\n    args=[\r\n      spec.Tensor((), dtype),\r\n      spec.Tensor((), dtype),\r\n    ],\r\n    ret=spec.Tensor((), dtype),\r\n  ),\r\n  \"ext_test_sym\": spec.ExternFunctionSpec(\r\n    args=[\r\n      spec.Tensor((\"x\", \"y\", 1), dtype),\r\n      spec.Tensor((\"y\", \"z\", 5), dtype),\r\n    ],\r\n    ret=spec.Tensor((\"x\", \"y\", \"z\", 9), dtype),\r\n  ),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand thus the external module could be defined as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyExtMod(nn.SourceModule):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__(\r\n            source_code=SOURCE_CODE,\r\n            source_format=\"cpp\",\r\n            functions=functions,\r\n        )\r\n    def scalar_add(self, a: nn.Tensor, b: nn.Tensor):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n        return self.get_extern_func(\"ext_scalar_add\")(a, b)\r\n    def test_sym(self, a: nn.Tensor, b: nn.Tensor):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n        return self.get_extern_func(\"ext_test_sym\")(a, b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny `nn.Module` could use this `nn.SourceModule` as part of the computation\r\nand export them into TVM IRModule:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_ext_mod = MyExtMod()\r\n\r\nclass TestModule(nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        self.extern_matmul = my_ext_mod\r\n\r\n    def scalar_add(self, a: nn.Tensor, b: nn.Tensor):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n        return self.extern_matmul.scalar_add(a, b)\r\n\r\n    def test_sym(self, a: nn.Tensor, b: nn.Tensor):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n        return self.extern_matmul.test_sym(a,

PR updates the type of `TupleGetItem::index` from `int` to `Expr`, to allow access of a tuple at a location specified by a symbolic variable.  The lack of this functionality was run into multiple times while implementing pre-sharded model weights ([MLC-LLM PR link](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/pull/1096)).  While that case could be worked around by using `R.strided_slice` instead of `R.split`, it isn't as clean of a solution.\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently marked as a draft, as it passes the unit tests that it adds, it is likely to cause breakage elsewhere and may require backwards compatibility

Runner and test with torch\r\nM1.6 Add Runner and test with tensorflow\r\nM1.7 Add Runner and test with tensorrt\r\n\r\nRunner is the very basic part of MSC compiling pipeline. It manage tools in MSC and unify the forward process of all frameworks.\r\nRunner also build and hold model in framework format, which can be use in training.\r\nRunner can be used locally(with msc.manager) or together with distribution system(with msc.wrapper).\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao

PR changes how to get the `Session` from `DPackedFunc` or `DModule`. Without this, there will be data corruption in the message channel, if Python gc happens in a different thread than the thread that owns the Disco session, which is typical in a multi-thread environment like LLM inference server.\r\n\r\nAn explanation on how such data corruption could occur:\r\n\r\n1. Every time dref.session gets called. A new Session Python object will be created, due to how FFI works https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/python/tvm/runtime/disco/session.py#L42\r\n2. When we want to call the model through disco, we need to first obtain the DPackedFunc through DModule . This process calls the _get_cached_method on a new Session object (follows (1)) https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/python/tvm/runtime/disco/session.py#L97\r\n3. In hasattr(self, \"_cache\") , a call is made to the tvm::ReflectionVTable::GetAttr to check if it exists in the TVM object https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/python/tvm/runtime/disco/session.py#L107\r\n4. This call will fail and raise error, which gets caught by https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/python/tvm/_ffi/_ctypes/packed_func.py#L239. hasattr will swallow this error and return False.\r\n5. During the creation of the FFI error in (4), traceback objects are created to help trace into C++ function. https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/python/tvm/_ffi/base.py#L373 Holding a reference to the frame object creates circular references that goes 'frame -> parent frames -> frame that holds the traceback object -> traceback -> frame'. All local variables in the call stack will be indirectly referenced and cannot be freed by ref counting. This is okay because Python gc will collect these objects once they are unreachable.\r\n6. (5) prevents the DPackedFunc returned from _get_cached_method to be freed through Python ref counting, because it's in the frame that's indirectly referred by the circular reference in (5).\r\n7. If Python gc happens in the main thread, the DPackedFunc from (6) will be collected, because there is no references to the newly-created Session, other than the reference path rooted from the circular reference between traceback and frame (from (5)).\r\n8. (7) will result in writing to the pipe in the main thread from the DRef destructor. https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572/include/tvm/runtime/disco/session.h#L301 If other disco activity happens in another thread, there will be multiple threads writing to the same pipe without synchronization. Data will be corrupted.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes (1) and (3), so that the data corruption will not occur anymore.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao

to this commit, `FuseTIR` required the symbolic shape of an argument to be a structural match to the symbolic shape of a parameter.  As a result, erroneous failures to match would occur when the dynamic shape parameter contains expressions, and the static shape argument does not.  For example, a parameter `[n, m, n*m]` is not structurally matched to an argument `[16, 16, 256]`, but is a valid substitution.  This commit updates `FuseTIR` to handle these cases.","created_at":"2023-10-26T17:48:00Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T14:17:14Z","closed_at":"2023-11-30T04:41:50Z","merged_at":"2023-11-30T04:41:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"68443482c9ba553e93bfefc4d70e5e0ef9677366","assignee":{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/567ac7520f26dd64b593767d2b93017e9e0fb44c","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_fuse_tir_dynamic_matching","ref":"unity_fuse_tir_dynamic_matching","sha":"567ac7520f26dd64b593767d2b93017e9e0fb44c","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `VarBinding` and `MatchCast` had equivalent `Expr value` fields.  For use cases that need the bound value (e.g. collecting known values), this required downcasting to each subclass.  This commit moves the `Expr value` to the base `Binding` class, removing the need for the downcasting.\r\n\r\nNo impact to either C++ or Python usage is expected.  On the C++ side, all use of `VarBindingNode::value` or `MatchCastNode::value` will now access `BindingNode::value`.  On the Python side, all dynamic access of `binding_obj.value` will access the new field.","created_at":"2023-10-26T15:12:05Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T14:50:39Z","closed_at":"2023-10-30T14:50:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"441eb0206b0f9f6095eb367f99a143ec2b67125f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0c1bb250a7af9651cafb5b85ff3bd337841dbf8c","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_move_value_to_base_binding_class","ref":"unity_move_value_to_base_binding_class","sha":"0c1bb250a7af9651cafb5b85ff3bd337841dbf8c","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a parameter required by cutlass and flash batched attention kernels. In practice, we compute this value at runtime via `max_seqlen = relax.op.max(seq_lens)`. Since the result of the max op is `Tensor[(), int32]` on GPU rather than a plain int32, and currently there is no easy way to convert the scalar tensor to a plain scalar, we've been doing `cudaMemcpy` of a single int32 to get a plain int32 from `DLTensor` of shape () in each kernel call. \r\n\r\nTo remove unnecessary `cudaMemcpy`, I'm now enforcing the scalar tensor `max_seqlen` to be on CPU, so that in a kernel we can simply do `max_seqlen->data[0]` rather than `cudaMemcpy` to get an int32 value. The test case demonstrates how to do cuda -> cpu copy in a Relax mod - it uses the \"virtual device\" concept.\r\n\r\n@vinx13 @sunggg

We encourage everyone to upgrade, and to use a tool such as <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/\">pip-tools</a> to pin all dependencies and control upgrades.

PR uses fast_exp to convert power op to fast but approximate counterpart.\r\n\r\nWhen y is not an integer, fast_exp(log(x) * y) is much faster than topi.power(x, y).

overwriting the same `data_entry_` variable with `DLTensor`s on different devices, since `data_entry_` is not thread local. This results in a runtime crash since, for example, the device 0 may try to call cuBLAS on `DLTensor`s in `data_entry_` which might live on other devices.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue and now

to this commit, iteration over a `relax.Expr` relied on an exception being thrown from `TupleGetItem`, which was then re-raised as an `IndexError`.  This allowed Python's default implementation of iteration over an object that defines `__getitem__`, but doesn't define `__iter__` or `__len__` to terminate.  However, if the object being iterated over did not have `TupleStructInfo`, it would result in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds an explicit implementation of `__iter__`, which raises a `TypeError` when called, preventing the default implementation provided by Python.  This is an intentional breakage of backwards compatibility, as arbitrary `relax.Expr` instances were not intended to be iterable.","created_at":"2023-10-24T16:15:22Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:20Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dbb7186dc1fb04bc853879bff99fdb27349921fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7cc3faf9db324008dbae5b0880f1f6a4eaafa922","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_expr_iteration_is_forbidden","ref":"unity_expr_iteration_is_forbidden","sha":"7cc3faf9db324008dbae5b0880f1f6a4eaafa922","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, iteration over a `relax.Expr` relied on an exception being thrown from `TupleGetItem`, which was then re-raised as an `IndexError`.  This allowed Python's default implementation of iteration over an object that defines `__getitem__`, but doesn't define `__iter__` or `__len__` to terminate.  However, if the object being iterated over did not have `TupleStructInfo`, it would result in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds an explicit implementation of `__iter__`, which checks whether the expression being iterated over to have `TupleStructInfo`.  This retains backwards compatibility for cases that were previously valid, but provides an explicit error in cases that would previously cause an infinite loop.","created_at":"2023-10-24T16:14:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:20Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ac04ea3ef3a2bf3b207eec3ef7c811a17252106","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b34a120b0de0b11614f02b3e1118f06b2a7ad290","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_expr_iteration_requires_tuplestructinfo","ref":"unity_expr_iteration_requires_tuplestructinfo","sha":"b34a120b0de0b11614f02b3e1118f06b2a7ad290","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR fix a bug that only appears on windows on symbolic var handling. For the function parameter var with Tuple struct info, directly iterate over that variable will cause out of bound error(which is properly handled in linux but not necessarily in windows due to how iteration is handled).\r\n\r\nNote that the var itself is not iterable and likely it relied on a sugar that var[i] dispatches to tuple_getitem and when it gets out of bound the exception get caught by the python iterator.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by directly iterate over the struct info array in the annotation.","created_at":"2023-10-24T02:35:05Z","updated_at":"2023-10-24T17:28:39Z","closed_at":"2023-10-24T04:05:16Z","merged_at":"2023-10-24T04:05:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcdbc3e244231c7f2e63d972b98d94d6a8878bcb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5b29fae357df9e476403758582ca117e24353cbf","head":{"label":"tqchen:transform-fix","ref":"transform-fix","sha":"5b29fae357df9e476403758582ca117e24353cbf","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.gith

response to the issue in common subexpression elimination noted in this [forum post](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/validity-of-common-subexpression-elimination-pass-that-simplifies-call-tir-args/15832), this PR fixes the case noted by allowing `call_tir` and its variants to correctly handle the case where they are passed a _variable_ bound to a tuple of arguments, rather than a tuple literal. This was an easy change to make and corresponds to user expectations.\r\n\r\nIn principle, we could address the issue highlighted in other ways, such as by changing common subexpression elimination to avoid doing elimination inside `call_tir` calls or treating `call_tir` as a special case during normalization. I went with this approach because I believe it to be simpler; however, we may consider other approaches if it is absolutely essential that the argument be a tuple _literal_.

design.)","created_at":"2023-10-24T01:37:49Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T20:10:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-25T20:10:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1093d5d39851b2022a0fae2b3058f285b3eeafe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

Pull Request adds support for AMD Matrix Core in MetaScheduler.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- **Add code generation for HIP**.  Additional support for hip code-gen is necessary. The advantages of generating HIP code are: 1. High readability of the code, 2. Avoiding some problems caused by generating llvm ir.  This part of the code is mainly contributed by @LeiWang1999 \r\n- **Add multi-level-tiling schedule rule for matrix core**.  Reuse the implementation of cuda tensorcore\r\n- **Add WMMA tensor intinsic**.  \r\n\r\n## Test Result\r\nCompared with template-based scheduling, metascheduler can achieve better performance when `max_trials_global` set 32 .\r\n| data type |  mnk   | template-based | meta scheduler |\r\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  | ----  |\r\n| f16f16f32|  128, 128, 128  |  692 GFLOPS  |  1251 GFLOPS |\r\n|

PR introduce a new LLVM ORC JIT executor for the runtime.\r\nThe new ORCJIT may obsolete MCJIT due to better upstream maintenance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n  * Old MCJIT is **default** , thus the previous behaviour is unchanged.\r\n  * The new ORCJIT is added as a alternative and **optional** llvm runtime engine.\r\n\r\n#### Rationale\r\n\r\n  * [MCJIT](https://llvm.org/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.html) is the first implementation in LLVM and looks to be unmaintained by upstream.\r\n  * The new [ORCJIT](https://llvm.org/docs/ORCv2.html) is added and it shares the same flow configuration as the current MCJIT.\r\n  * Targets like RISCV, and possible others too, will not work on MCJIT see some discussions [here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D127842) .\r\n* The new ORCJIT offers flexibile custom compilation and linkage flow that can be useful for future challenges.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n* The default is the old MCJIT so no changes in any behaviour of TVM, but being limited it fails on e.g. RISCV:\r\n```\r\n[23:35:43] src/target/llvm/codegen_llvm.cc:185: Warning: Set native vector bits to be 128 for riscv64\r\nLLVM ERROR: Relocation type not implemented yet!\r\n```\r\n* The new ORCJIT can be invoked by ```llvm -jit=orcjit {...}```, this works even on RISCV targets.\r\n\r\nThis implementation here is backward compatibile and was tested on LLVM={10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHalide project also [leverage orcjit runtime](https://github.com/halide/Halide/blob/eb66c06539d623459ea3c3abeea5b7cce111ad5f/src/JITModule.cpp#L380).\r\nAlso may relate to PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14836 and TK #10141 ongoing effort toward RISCV

```atomic_add``` mapping to proper LLVM intrinsic guaranteed (best-effort) to lower to single instruction.\r\n\r\n#### Rationale\r\n\r\nSome highly efficient CPU intrinsics related to data type manipulations of whole vectors **are not exposed** by LLVM.\r\nAs substitute LLVM offers \"higher level functions\" with guarantees that will emit the exact & right instruction on CPU.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n* On x86 we want to expand a vector from ```uint8x16``` ->  ```uint16x16``` or perhaps sign expand to ```int16x16```. \r\n    In order to do this the [pmovzxwd](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/pmovsx.php?f=pmovzxwd) and [pmovsxbw](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/pmovsx.php?f=pmovsxbw)   are needed which are **not** exposed by LLVM directly. \r\n     The new ```zextend``` (non-sign, zero aware) and ```sextend``` (sign aware) functions can now do this:\r\n\r\n   * Here is the tir invocation:\r\n    ```\r\n      vec_a_words = tvm.tir.zextend(\"uint16x8\", vec_a_uint8x8)\r\n      vec_b_words = tvm.tir.sextend(\"int16x8\", vec_b_int8x8)\r\n    ```\r\n   * In the lowered x86 assembley there are now *exactly* the mentioned two instructions:\r\n   ```\r\n    1ea3:\tc4 e2 79 30 e2       \tvpmovzxbw %xmm2,%xmm4\r\n    1ea8:\tc4 e2 79 20 12       \tvpmovsxbw (%rdx),%xmm2\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nA more complete example with real usage in a tensorization process with these new tir operators [can be seen here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/0d338828eebaa3ff705e8521f2a1b3530f73dc7d/python/tvm/topi/x86/tensor_intrin.py#L152-L198) .\r\nThis also allows more TOPI/MS data type conversions leveraging precise control on involved atomic CPU instructions.\r\n\r\nThis PR is indispensable part of #15918 , an effort towards int8 tensorization coverage on x86.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCc: @Lunderberg ,

to this commit, sharding of model weights was always performed when initializing the model.  This could cause slow initialization, especially for larger numbers of GPUs, as all model weights are initially transferred to GPU-0, before being scattered to all workers.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `tvm::runtime::ShardLoaderObj` to also allow loading of pre-sharded model weights.  With pre-sharded model weights, the tensors are sharded while the model is being built, and each worker independently loads the specific model weights that it requires.","created_at":"2023-10-20T16:10:39Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T14:05:49Z","closed_at":"2023-11-09T14:05:45Z","merged_at":"2023-11-09T14:05:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e359e7a210b144327eb3cb5e4f0c4d1968568407","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/af8ae5059092b8c075df7d2c246b3b533205b636","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_load_presharded_params","ref":"disco_load_presharded_params","sha":"af8ae5059092b8c075df7d2c246b3b533205b636","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `DecomposeOpsForTraining` transform directly replaced `relax.nn.batch_norm` into more primitive relax operations. This required the decomposed form of `relax.nn.batch_norm` to be duplicated with `DecomposeOpsForInference`.  This commit refactors the pass to occur in two steps, first to apply training-specific mutations, and then to decompose.\r\n\r\nHaving a clear `DecomposeOps` pass also has a clear single location for operator decomposition, which may be migrated into the operator definition in the future, similar to `FLegalize`.","created_at":"2023-10-19T19:29:31Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T15:48:32Z","closed_at":"2024-01-16T14:08:41Z","merged_at":"2024-01-16T14:08:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2a1b534024e677a9407bec8d09d99f2237b2b0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/96166108974edd683a11324a4803b10e5185a7eb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_decompose_ops","ref":"unity_decompose_ops","sha":"96166108974edd683a11324a4803b10e5185a7eb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a pull request for MSC(Multi-System Compile)\r\nRFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-unity-msc-introduction-to-multi-system-compiler/15251/5\r\nTracking issue: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the 3rd part of Milestone 1: Finish RuntimeManager for frameworks\r\n\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 1 will be split into some steps:\r\nM1.1 Add translate && codegen for torch\r\nM1.2 Add translate && codegen for tensorflow\r\n**M1.3 Add codegen for tensorrt**\r\nM1.4 Add Runner and test with relax\r\nM1.5 Add Runner and test with torch\r\nM1.6 Add Runner and test with tensorflow\r\nM1.7 Add Runner and test with tensorrt\r\n\r\nThis PR support tensorrt in a codegen way. Same strategy is used in Nvidia Nackthon 2021: https://github.com/Archermmt/yolov3_dcn_nv_hackthon2021 (special price for latency and bug detection).\r\n\r\n2 passes are added to support BYOC\r\n1.BindShape: Works like FuseOpsByPattern(bind_constant=True). This pass bind the ShapeExpr of extern func to Expr.\r\n2.FuseTuple: This pass fuse Tuple and TupleGetitem to byoc func.\r\n\r\nWhy use codegen flavor to support TensorRT:\r\n1.  To enable deploy tensorrt solution in different runtime environment without re-compile the model.\r\n2. To enable the usage of MSC tools in TensorRT. Including pruning, debugging and so on.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao

to this commit, `relax.transform.CanonicalizeBindings` removed trivial bindings `var_y = var_x` where a `var_y: relax.DataflowVar` and `var_x: relax.Var`, but did not remove trivial bindings when `var_y: relax.Var` and `var_x: relax.DataflowVar`.  This was to avoid invalid use of a `relax.DataflowVar` outside of a dataflow block.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `CanonicalizeBindings` to handle this type of binding as well.  To ensure that no `relax.DataflowVar` instances are used outside of a dataflow block, this is done by replacing `var_y: relax.DataflowVar` at its point of definition, instead of replacing `var_x: relax.Var` at its point of use.\r\n\r\nThis commit also canonicalizes `relax.Var` definitions to `relax.DataflowVar`, if the binding occurs within a dataflow block, and the variable is never used outside of a dataflow block.","created_at":"2023-10-17T15:26:35Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T14:13:37Z","closed_at":"2023-10-25T14:13:33Z","merged_at":"2023-10-25T14:13:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d19c8ab1f2dd03b1cd6f7eff10eba020867e4b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ba475d1405b2619d1df0405da716ce6df57f787b","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_canonicalize_var_to_dataflowvar_inside_dataflowblock","ref":"unity_canonicalize_var_to_dataflowvar_inside_dataflowblock","sha":"ba475d1405b2619d1df0405da716ce6df57f787b","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Pull Request adds support for AMD Matrix Core in MetaScheduler.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- **Add code generation for HIP**.  Additional support for hip code-gen is necessary. The advantages of generating HIP code are: 1. High readability of the code, 2. Avoiding some problems caused by generating llvm ir.  This part of the code is mainly contributed by @LeiWang1999 \r\n- **Add multi-level-tiling schedule rule for matrix core**.  Similar to the implementation of cuda tensorcore\r\n- **Add WMMA tensor intinsic**.  \r\n\r\n## Test Result\r\nCompared with template-based scheduling, metascheduler can achieve better performance when `max_trials_global` set 32 .\r\n| data type |  mnk   | template-based | meta scheduler |\r\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  | ----  |\r\n| f16f16f32|  128, 128, 128  |  692 GFLOPS  |  1251 GFLOPS

trilu test from test_translate_relay.py results in failures(e.g https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15783). This PR fix the bugs.\r\nBesides, I use a customized ops map to convert torch.max(x, dim=(1,2)) to relay and test the torch codegen. Neither relay nor relax support this op (when call max with dims, the outputs behavior is different, sa https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.max.html). The customized ops converter is not included in this PR. I may contribute the parser part after MSC, while currently I focus on MSC. To support the special ops like torch.max with dim, I reconstruct codegen a little.\r\n\r\ncc @Lunderberg

pull request addresses a TypeError that occurs in the interpolate function when the scale_factor parameter is of type tuple. The current implementation fails to handle cases where scale_factor is a tuple, resulting in the error message: \"TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'list'.\"\r\n\r\nThis patch allows the interpolate function to handle both scalar and tuple values for the scale_factor parameter without raising a TypeError.\r\n\r\nAnd this bug can be reproduced by the following script:\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch import fx\r\nfrom torch.nn import Module\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relax\r\nfrom tvm.relax.frontend.torch import from_fx\r\n\r\ninput_data = torch.randn([1, 2, 4, 4], dtype=torch.float32)\r\nclass interpolate(Module):\r\n    def forward(self, input):\r\n        return torch.nn.functional.interpolate(input, size=None, scale_factor=(2.0, 1.0), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False,)\r\n\r\nmodel = interpolate().float()\r\ninput_data = [input_data]\r\ninput_info = list(zip([list(inp.shape) for inp in input_data], [str(inp.dtype) for inp in input_data]))\r\nfx_model : torch.fx.GraphModule = fx.symbolic_trace(model)\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    mod = from_fx(fx_model,

PR fixes a bug in the interpolate operator of the PyTorch frontend in TVM. The bug was caused by incorrectly using the `method` keyword instead of the `mode` keyword when retrieving the default value for the mode parameter. This resulted in incorrect computation of `interpolate` results.\r\n\r\nThis bug can be reproduced by the below script:\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch import fx\r\nfrom torch.nn import

to this commit, the `tvm::script::printer::AttrPrinter` class took the attribute path as a `const ObjectPath&`.  In both places where an `AttrPrinter` is called, the temporary object `n_p->Attr(\"attrs\")` is passed for this argument.  While binding a temporary object to a const reference can extend the lifetime of the temporary, this requires the const reference to be in the same scope as the temporary, and does not apply in this case (see [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2784304)).  Therefore, this reference is only valid through the construction of `AttrPrinter printer`, and is invalid during its usage on the following line.\r\n\r\nThis dangling reference has caused segfaults in CI for unrelated changes ([example](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm-unity/detail/PR-15904/3/pipeline)), and can be reproduced with the following test case.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nfrom tvm.script import relax as R\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"iter\", range(10000))\r\ndef test_argmax_without_specified_axis(iter):\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def func(x: R.Tensor((1, 2, 3, 4), \"float32\")):\r\n        return R.argmax(x)\r\n\r\n    func.script(show_meta=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test case is not included in this commit, as the reproduction is not consistent, with failure requiring on the order of 10k iterations to trigger.  In addition, reproduction was sensitive to the following conditions.\r\n\r\n* The function being printed must contain at least one `relax::Call` node, with an operation that has attributes.\r\n\r\n* TVM must be built with optimization enabled.  In gcc, the `-ftree-dse` optimization, which is part of `-O1`, is required to trigger the bug.\r\n\r\n* Python's default allocation must be used.  If `PYTHONMALLOC=malloc` is set to instead use the system's `malloc`, the segfault was no longer triggered.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `AttrPrinter` to accept the `ObjectPath` by value. With the change applied, the above test ran 100k times without

PR enhances x86 SIMD (u)int8 coverage for dense and conv2d operators.\r\nIt extends current SIMD support with avx2 & ssse3, and adds a new set of non-overflowing SIMD method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Tracker:\r\n\r\n- [ ] PR for TIR ```call_{pure}_llvm_intrin``` pretty print.\r\n- [ ] PR for new TIR intrinsics\r\n- [ ] PR for ```ArrayIntImm``` node\r\n\r\nThis PR will hold only the TOPI part.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n[x86][TOPI]\r\n  * Extends [current tensorizer set](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/dc1b62916f68bf7b7f417eb4ea79bc75e83ec1a5/python/tvm/topi/x86/tensor_intrin.py#L130-L150), now called ```fast-math``` overflowing one, with ```avx2``` and ```ssse3```.\r\n  * Adds a [new tensorizer set](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/dc1b62916f68bf7b7f417eb4ea79bc75e83ec1a5/python/tvm/topi/x86/tensor_intrin.py#L151-L198), a \"precision\" non-overflowing one, supporting: ```avx512```,  ```avx2``` and ```ssse3```.\r\n  * Enable proper operator data alignment to gurantee any data (even smallest) will fit the SIMD vector width.\r\n\r\n[TIR][LLVM]\r\n * Adds new TIR ops mapped to LLVM instrinsics: ```zextend```, ```sextend```, ```truncate``` for type conversions.\r\n * Adds new TIR ops mapped to LLVM instrinsics: ```vectorpermute```, ```vectorshuffle``` for vector manipulation.\r\n * The ```call_llvm_pure_intrin``` & ```call_llvm_intrin``` now holds instruction ```StringImm``` instead of ```IntImm``` abstract.\r\n * Enables TIR op ```atomic_add``` mapped to proper LLVM intrinsic guarnteed (best-effort) to lower to single instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TE]\r\n * Introduce new ```ArrayIntImm``` expression for small immediate list of integer constants.\r\n\r\n[Target]\r\n* Introduce a flag ```-key=cpu,fast-math``` to switch from the precise SIMD (default) to the overflowing SIMD set.\r\n\r\n#### Performance\r\n\r\nFor the new avx2 & ssse3 the ```fast``` vs. ```precise``` SIMD sets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 tests/python/contrib/test_gemm_acc32_simd.py\r\nTask tensorized: {True } [llvm -mcpu=ivybridge                     ], running time: 3.655 ms, 587.58 Gops/s\r\nTask tensorized: {True } [llvm -mcpu=ivybridge -keys=cpu,fast-math ], running time: 3.678 ms, 583.86 Gops/s\r\nTask tensorized: {True } [llvm -mcpu=haswell                       ], running time: 3.708 ms, 579.09 Gops/s\r\nTask tensorized: {True } [llvm -mcpu=haswell -keys=cpu,fast-math   ], running time: 3.668 ms, 585.52 Gops/s\r\nTask tensorized: {False} [llvm -mcpu=ivybridge                     ], running time: 41.152 ms, 52.18 Gops/s\r\nTask tensorized: {False} [llvm -mcpu=haswell                       ], running time: 41.194 ms, 52.13 Gops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n* Precision (non ```fast-math```) is the default now.\r\n* x86 ```amx``` and ```vnni``` schedules remains unchanged, their specific intrinsics never overflows.\r\n* The ```zextend```, ```sextend```, ```truncate``` lowers on x86 into single specialized instruction e.g: ```punpcklwd``` & ```punpckhwd```\r\n* The ```vectorpermute```, ```vectorshuffle``` also lowers on x86 into appropriate single specialized instruction.\r\n* ```ArrayIntImm``` is for the new ops: ```tir.vectorpermute(\"int32x8\", whatever_vector, [0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7])```\r\n* The ```fast-math``` mode will always warn the user: \r\n    ```Using `fast-math` may overflow, make sure ranges for either data is [0,128] or weight

to this commit, several transforms assumed that the arguments passed to a `call_tir` builtin were provided as in-line `relax::Tuple` objects.  Because it would be equally valid for the arguments to instead be a `relax::Var` instance that had previously been bound to a `relax::Tuple` object, or had been passed as an input parameter with `relax::TupleStructInfo`, this assumption shouldn't be made.  This PR updates the `CallTIRRewrite`, `FoldConstant`, `FuseOps`, and `RewriteDataflowReshape` passes to handle variables providing the arguments.","created_at":"2023-10-11T19:01:38Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T17:36:49Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T17:36:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffd7316c3b70523ff3b7e7b603af7622535e8477","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5089f47f8f8f5ac6e109120fb344ff8160101fbb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_support_tuple_vars_in_call_tir","ref":"unity_support_tuple_vars_in_call_tir","sha":"5089f47f8f8f5ac6e109120fb344ff8160101fbb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
