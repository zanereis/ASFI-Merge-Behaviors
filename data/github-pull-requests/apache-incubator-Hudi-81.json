What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nAdd support for timestamp field in HiveSync\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Hudi HiveSyncTool converts int64 fields to 'bigint' hive type.\r\n- There are use cases where we want to convert this to 'timestamp' type when corresponding parquet original type is TIMESTAMP_MICROS (We can also consider doing this for TIMESTAMP_MILLIS?)\r\n- This has to be done in backward compatible way, so already synced tables will continue to get hive type as 'bigint'. We can enable 'timestamp' conversion by overriding sync config with a new flag.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests. Also verified with steps in docker demo.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n1. Use the DAG Node's label from the yaml as its name instead of UUID names which are not descriptive when debugging issues from logs.\r\n2. Fix CleanNode constructor which is not correctly implemented\r\n3. When generating upsets, allows more granualar control over the number of inserts and upserts - zero or more inserts and upserts can be specified instead of always requiring both inserts and upserts.\r\n4. Fixed generation of records of specific size\r\n   - The current code was using a class variable \"shouldAddMore\" which was reset to false after the first record generation causing subsequent records to be of minimum size.\r\n   - In this change, we pre-calculate the extra size of the complex fields. When generating records, for complex fields we read the field size from this map.\r\n5. Refresh the timeline of the DeltaSync service before calling readFromSource. This ensures that only the newest generated data is read and data generated in the older Dag Nodes is ignored (as their AVRO files will have an older timestamp).\r\n6. Making --workload-generator-classname an optional parameter as most probably the default will be used\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a

So, this patch introduces HoodieConcatHandle which will just append/concat new incoming data to existing data for a given data file w/o performing any merge(combineAndUpdate) as such. Its users responsibility to ensure there are no duplicate if the config is enabled with `Insert` operation.   \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added HoodieConcatHandle to concat/append incoming records to existing records for a given data file w/o performing any merge for `Insert` operation.\r\n  - Added a new config `hoodie.merge.allow.duplicate.inserts` to guard this new behavior. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage(testInsertsWithHoodieConcatHandle and testInsertsPreppedWithHoodieConcatHandle) to verify new

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis is minor CR which removes a useless config for bootstrap integ test. This useless config may cause misleading for customers who see that part of code as a bootstrap example.\r\n\r\n```hoodie.bootstrap.recordkey.columns``` is not valid parameter and you cannot find any definition in the Hudi package. The record key for bootstrap table is actually defined by ```hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field```. In ```ITTestHoodieDemo.java```, it is defined in the ```dfs-source.properties```: https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/docker/demo/config/dfs-source.properties#L20, that's why even with this useless config, the integ testing still works.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove ```hoodie.bootstrap.recordkey.columns```.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen unit tests are run on shared machines (e.g. jenkins cluster), the unit tests sometimes fail due to BindException in starting HDFS Cluster. This is because the port chosen may have been bound by another process using the same machine. The fix is to retry the port selection a few times.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded a loop when creating HDFS Cluster.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdd new Payload(OverwriteNonDefaultsWithLatestAvroPayload) for updating specified fields in storage\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nupdate current value for several fields that you want to change.\r\n\r\nThe default payload OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload overwrite the whole record when \r\n\r\ncompared to `orderingVal`.This doesn't meet our need when we just want to change specified fields.\r\nFor example: (suppose Default value is null)\r\n```\r\ncurrent Value \r\nField:      name   age   gender\r\nValue:     karl     20    male\r\n```\r\n```\r\ninsert Value\r\nField:      name   age   gender\r\nValue:     null     30    null\r\n```\r\n```\r\nAfter insert:\r\nField:      name   age   gender\r\nValue:     karl     30    male\r\n```\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded TestOverwriteNonDefaultsWithLatestAvroPayload to verify the change.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n- [x]  Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n\r\n - [ ] Commit

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nAdd replace a top level action. Implement insert_overwrite operation on top of replace action\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1) All post commit actions work on top of HoodieCommitMetadata. Create HoodieReplaceMetadata to be subclass of HoodieCommitMetadata\r\n2) Add insertOverwrite as new operation on HoodieWriteClient. insertOverwrite uses REPLACE action to mark all existing file groups as 'invalid'\r\n3) Change archival to delete replaced files before archiving REPLACE action metadata\r\n\r\nThere are two other things that needs to be addressed:\r\n1) Everywhere, we try to invoke 'getCommitsTimeline'/'filterCommits', we need to review and make sure caller can handle replace actions. OR create new methods and refactor all invocations of getCommitsTimeline call new methods.\r\n2) FileSystemView#getAllFileGroups (and other methods in view) by default excludes file groups that have been replaced. We have to make sure callers can handle file groups that existed before, but have been replaced. (Example: say, there is a CompactionPlan that includes file id f1. f1 is replaced at a later instant. If compaction is run after replace, it wont be able to find corresponding file group. We need to make sure compaction can make progress instead of throwing errors here.) \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThis change added tests. Verified basic actions using quick start and docker setup. Added tests for insertOverwrite and FileSystemView changes. Need to add additional tests for backward compatibility. Also need to change integration tests to include insertOverwrite operations. Created followup tickets here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-868\r\n\r\nThis is an example .hoodie folder from quick start setup:\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 satishkotha  wheel  1933 Aug 27 16:39

request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nEach insert/upsert dag node in the hudi test-suite can specify a schema to be used for the node.   DAG execution context\r\nis reinitialized with the new/evolved schema.  This allows verification of schema evolution scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n - Modify the test suite to accept \"reinitialize_context\" flag and new schema file.\r\n - reinitialize the writer context, as part of DAG node execution.  (Remaining nodes will use the updated schema).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nVerified using the hudi-test-suite.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Launched hudi test suite with the following:\r\n```\r\n    insert_1:\r\n      config:\r\n        record_size: 7000\r\n        num_partitions_insert: 1\r\n        repeat_count: 5\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen schema is evolved but producer is still producing events using older version of schema, Hudi delta streamer is failing. This fix is to make sure delta streamer works fine with schema evoluation.\r\n\r\nRelated issues #1845 #1971 #1972 \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Update avro to spark conversion method `AvroConversionHelper.createConverterToRow` to handle scenario when provided schema has more fields than data (scenario where producer is still sending events with old schema)\r\n -  Introduce new payload class called `BaseAvroPayloadWithSchema`. This is used to store the writer schema part of payload. Currently, `HoodieAvroUtils.avroToBytes` uses the schema of the data to convert to bytes, but `HoodieAvroUtils.bytesToAvro` uses provided schema. Since both may not match always, it results in error. By having data's schema as part of payload, we can ensure, same schema is used for converting avro to bytes and bytes back to avro. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit test to verify schema evoluation* Thanks @sbernauer for unit test\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in
