For Python 3.10, 3.11 there will be a deprecation warning when distutils is imported. To avoid the deprecation warnings, Replace distutils with supported modules. \r\n\r\nimporting `setuptools` also imports copy of  `distutils` from setuptools. if a stdlib `distutils` is imported and then `setuptools` is imported, it will delete the `stdlib\\distutils` import and replaces with `setuptools\\distutils`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pipeline translation in `SparkStructuredStreamingRunner` (closes #22445, #22382):\r\n\r\n- Make use of Spark `Encoder`s to leverage structural information in translation (and potentially benefit from Catalyst optimizer). Though note, the possible benefit is limited as every `ParDo` is a black box and a hard boundary for anything that could be optimized.\r\n- Improved translation of `GroupByKey`. When applicable, group also by window to better scale out and/or use Spark native   `collect_list` to collect values of group.\r\n- Make use of specialised Spark `Aggregator`s for combine (per key / globally), particularly `Sessions` can be improved significantly.\r\n- Dedicated translation for `Combine.Globally` to avoid additional shuffle of data.\r\n- Remove additional serialization roundtrip when reading from a Beam `BoundedSource`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes #22431\r\n\r\nRelated, it might be worth rewriting the [GCS staging process](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/dataflow/util/PackageUtil.java#L125) to do a bulk match, which would allow a single (or at least significantly less) API calls to check if the files to stage exist or not.  Doing so would require a pretty significant rewrite of that process though.\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I've created a minimum viable Apache Beam runner for Dask. My approach is to visit a Beam Pipeline and translate PCollections into Dask Bags.\r\n\r\nIn this version, I have supported enough operations to make test pipeline asserts work. The test themselves are not comprehensive. Further, there are [many Bag operations](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-api.html) that could be translated for greater efficiency. \r\n\r\nCC:  @pabloem\r\n\r\nFixes: #18962\r\n\r\nOriginal PR discussion can be found here: https://github.com/alxmrs/beam/pull/1\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

2.40.0 (this PR https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17423), there are three to get the failed inserts from a `BigQueryIO` Write, as it was now added a specific tag/PCollection when using the write method via Storage API (`STORAGE_WRITE_API` or `STORAGE_API_AT_LEAST_ONCE`).\r\n\r\nThe exception when the requested tag is null is misleading now, as it explicitly says that the other method should be used. However, in the case of Storage API, the recommended method won't work either.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22401\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR address #21414 with a KafkaSchemaTransformReadConfiguration implementation.  It's design goals are to work with a KafkaSchemaTransformReadProvider that extends a [TypedSchemaTransformProvider](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/transforms/TypedSchemaTransformProvider.java).  Subsequent to this PR's approval/merge, the plan is to implement said corresponding  KafkaSchemaTransformReadProvider.\r\n\r\n**Questions remain, however, how to configure the following in the setting of a [TypedSchemaTransformProvider](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/transforms/TypedSchemaTransformProvider.java):**\r\n\r\n- [withCheckStopReadingFn](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#withCheckStopReadingFn-org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.SerializableFunction-)\r\n- [withConsumerFactoryFn](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#withConsumerFactoryFn-org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.SerializableFunction-)\r\n- [withKeyDeserializer](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#withKeyDeserializer-java.lang.Class-)\r\n- [withValueDeserializer](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.Read.html#withValueDeserializer-java.lang.Class-)\r\n\r\nDue to historically failing beam_PreCommit_Java tests, to validate this PR, I ran the following prior to submission:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew rat\r\n./gradlew spotlessCheck\r\n./gradlew sdks:java:io:kafka:check\r\n./gradlew sdks:java:io:kafka:checkStyleMain\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to request the following to review this PR:\r\nR: @pabloem \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n    Adding default process ns metrics for executable stages in samza runner.\r\n    \r\n    1. Nano second instead of milli second as the process time is expected to be arond 0.01 milli second.\r\n    \r\n    2. Sampling metric to reduce performance impact.\r\n    \r\n    3. Random based sampling instead of couting based sampling as SdkHarnessDoFnRunner is stateless and new instance created for each execution of ExecutableStage.\r\n    \r\n    4. Suppress RandomModInteger warning since 1/n chance to be 0 is still expected.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, our GitHub Actions tests run `npm install` which has the potential to run ci with a different set of dependencies than are represented in the package.json. This means that functionally, dependencies in CI are slowly moving forward without us making any code changes, and don't represent what is potentially going to be published. This is also a potential vector for security attacks.\r\n\r\nThis updates to use `npm ci` in CI. Fixes #22322\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Mention the appropriate issue in your description (for example: `addresses #123`), if applicable. This will automatically add a link to the pull request in the issue. If you would like the issue to automatically close on merging the pull request, comment `fixes #<ISSUE NUMBER>` instead.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this

PR fixes BEAM-10785 (#20532 on Github) by an alternative way: Adding `ensure_ascii=False` to `json.dumps` on `RowAsDictJsonCoder`.\r\n\r\nThe original way for fixing this issue was enabling `coder` argument on WriteToBigQuery and passing it downstream, but other way was discussed on #17518.\r\n\r\nResolves #20532.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
