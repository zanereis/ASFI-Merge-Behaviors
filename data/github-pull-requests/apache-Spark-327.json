What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix two problems as below:\r\n\r\n**Use previous code path to handle `null` in distinct pivot values**\r\n\r\nAn optimisation to this was introduced to prevent each input gets evaluated on every aggregate which seems making it slow when `pivotValues` are too many. It seems this tightly assumes that this distinct pivot value can't be `null`.\r\n\r\nI could not find a clean and easy workaround to support this and wonder if it is worth. Please guide me if anyone knows a clean and short way to fix it in this two aggregation path.\r\n\r\n**Fix to count `null`**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nSeq(Tuple1(None), Tuple1(Some(1))).toDF(\"a\").groupBy($\"a\").count().show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore (Spark 1.6),\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----+----+---+\r\n|   a|null|  1|\r\n+----+----+---+\r\n|null|   0|  0|\r\n|   1|   0|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince Spark 2.0.0, `SET` commands do not pass the values to HiveClient. In most case, Spark handles well. However, for the dynamic partition insert, users meet the following misleading situation. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(1001).selectExpr(\"id as key\", \"id as value\").registerTempTable(\"t1001\")\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"create table p (value int) partitioned by (key int)\").show\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"insert into table p partition(key) select key, value from t1001\")\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException:\r\nDynamic partition strict mode requires at least one static partition column.\r\nTo turn this off set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict\")\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"insert into table p partition(key) select key, value from t1001\")\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException:\r\nNumber of dynamic partitions created is 1001, which is more than 1000.\r\nTo solve this try to set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions to at least 1001.\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions=1001\")\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions\").show(false)\r\n+--------------------------------+-----+\r\n|key                             |value|\r\n+--------------------------------+-----+\r\n|hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions|1001 |\r\n+--------------------------------+-----+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"insert into table p partition(key) select key, value from t1001\")\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException:\r\nNumber of dynamic partitions created is 1001, which is more than 1000.\r\nTo solve this try to set hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions to at least 1001.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last error is the same with the previous one. `HiveClient` does not know new value 1001. While users control `hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode`, there is no way to change the default value of `hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions` of `HiveCilent` with `SET` command.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `hive` parameters are passed to `HiveClient` on creating. So, the workaround is to use `--hiveconf` when starting `spark-shell`. However, it is still unchangeable in `spark-shell`. We had better handle this case without misleading error messages ending infinite loop.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAn additional trigger and trigger executor that will execute a single trigger only. One can use this OneTime trigger to have more control over the scheduling of triggers. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this patch requires an optimization to StreamExecution that logs a commit record at the end of successfully processing a batch. This new commit log will be used to determine the next batch (offsets) to process after a restart, instead of using the offset log itself to determine what batch to process next after restart; using the offset log to determine this would process the previously logged batch, always, thus not permitting a OneTime trigger feature.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA number of existing tests have been revised. These tests all assumed that when restarting a stream, the last batch in the offset log is to be re-processed. Given that we now have a commit log that will tell us if that last batch was processed successfully, the results/assumptions of those tests needed to be revised accordingly. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a OneTime trigger test was added to StreamingQuerySuite, which tests:\r\n- The semantics of OneTime trigger (i.e., on start, execute a single batch, then stop).\r\n- The case when the commit log was not able to successfully log the completion of a batch before restart, which would mean that we should fall back to what's in the offset log.\r\n- A OneTime trigger execution that results in an exception being thrown.\r\n\r\n@marmbrus @tdas @zsxwing \r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-09T00:25:17Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T21:55:44Z","closed_at":"2017-03-23T21:32:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1a41187fd5958d3399403eb4fa04934ee73dab9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c3e20c2e3586ad406796014397a1791c2305fe5","head":{"label":"tcondie:stream-commit","ref":"stream-commit","sha":"0c3e20c2e3586ad406796014397a1791c2305fe5","user":{"login":"tcondie","id":1696558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie","html_url":"https://github.com/tcondie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71503469,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTUwMzQ2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tcondie/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tcondie","id":1696558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTY1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie","html_url":"https://github.com/tcondie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcondie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tcondie/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn general we have a checkAnalysis phase which validates the logical plan and throws AnalysisException on semantic errors. However we also can throw AnalysisException from a few analyzer rules like ResolveSubquery.\r\n\r\nI found that we fire up the analyzer rules twice for the queries that throw AnalysisException from one of the analyzer rules.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using the KafkaSource with Structured Streaming, consumer assignments are not what the user expects if startingOffsets is set to an explicit set of topics/partitions in JSON where the topic(s) happen to have uppercase characters. When StartingOffsets is constructed, the original string value from options is transformed toLowerCase to make matching on \"earliest\" and \"latest\" case insensitive. However, the toLowerCase JSON is passed to SpecificOffsets for the terminal condition, so topic names may not be what the user intended by the time assignments are made with the underlying KafkaConsumer.\r\n\r\nKafkaSourceProvider.scala:\r\n```\r\nval startingOffsets = caseInsensitiveParams.get(STARTING_OFFSETS_OPTION_KEY).map(_.trim.toLowerCase) match {\r\n    case Some(\"latest\") => LatestOffsets\r\n    case Some(\"earliest\") => EarliestOffsets\r\n    case Some(json) => SpecificOffsets(JsonUtils.partitionOffsets(json))\r\n    case None => LatestOffsets\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhether or not use CachedKafkaConsumer need to be configured, when you use DirectKafkaInputDStream to connect the kafka in a Spark Streaming application. In Spark 2.x, the kafka consumer was replaced by CachedKafkaConsumer (some KafkaConsumer will keep establishing the kafka cluster), and cannot change the way. In fact ,The KafkaRDD(used by DirectKafkaInputDStream to connect kafka) provide the parameter useConsumerCache to choose Whether to use the CachedKafkaConsumer, but the DirectKafkaInputDStream always set the parameter true.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd handling of input of type `Int` for dataType `TimestampType` to `EvaluatePython.scala`. Py4J serializes ints smaller than MIN_INT or larger than MAX_INT to Long, which are handled correctly already, but values between MIN_INT and MAX_INT are serialized to Int.\r\n\r\nThese range limits correspond to roughly half an hour on either side of the epoch. As a result, PySpark doesn't allow TimestampType values to be created in this range.\r\n\r\nAlternatives attempted: patching the `TimestampType.toInternal` function to cast return values to `long`, so Py4J would always serialize them to Scala Long. Python3 does not have a `long` type, so this approach failed on Python3.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new PySpark-side test that fails without the change.\r\n\r\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\n\r\nResubmission of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16896. The original PR didn't go through Jenkins and broke the build. @davies @dongjoon-hyun\r\n\r\n@cloud-fan Could you kick off a Jenkins run for me? It passed everything for me locally, but it's possible something has changed in the last few weeks.","created_at":"2017-03-08T01:22:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T18:44:24Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T18:37:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf0f41ae15bfa1e5f77df7545c849bb6e1c1abce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bee635a3ebd96fe28e04b0fd95290b6960ea8d22","head":{"label":"JasonMWhite:SPARK-19561","ref":"SPARK-19561","sha":"bee635a3ebd96fe28e04b0fd95290b6960ea8d22","user":{"login":"JasonMWhite","id":2893818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTM4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2893818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonMWhite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45304942,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTMwNDk0Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"JasonMWhite/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JasonMWhite","id":2893818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTM4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2893818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite","html_url":"https://github.com/JasonMWhite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JasonMWhite/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JasonMWhite/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a output mode parameter to `flatMapGroupsWithState` and just define `mapGroupsWithState` as `flatMapGroupsWithState(Update)`.\r\n\r\n`UnsupportedOperationChecker` is modified to disallow unsupported cases.\r\n\r\n- Batch mapGroupsWithState or flatMapGroupsWithState is always allowed.\r\n- For streaming (map/flatMap)GroupsWithState, see the following table:\r\n\r\n| Operators  | Supported Query Output Mode |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| flatMapGroupsWithState(Update) without aggregation  | Update |\r\n| flatMapGroupsWithState(Update) with aggregation  | None |\r\n| flatMapGroupsWithState(Append) without aggregation  | Append |\r\n| flatMapGroupsWithState(Append) before aggregation  | Append, Update, Complete |\r\n| flatMapGroupsWithState(Append) after aggregation  | None |\r\n| Multiple flatMapGroupsWithState(Append)s  | Append |\r\n| Multiple mapGroupsWithStates  | None |\r\n| Mxing mapGroupsWithStates  and flatMapGroupsWithStates | None |\r\n| Other cases of multiple flatMapGroupsWithState | None |\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe added unit tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe way we currently do file partitioning strategy is hard coded in FileSourceScanExec. This is not ideal for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is difficult to unit test the default strategy. In order to test this, we need to do almost end-to-end tests by creating actual files on the file system.\r\n2. It is difficult to experiment with different partitioning strategies without adding a lot of if branches.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an internal interface for this so we can make this pluggable for both better testing and experimentation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe change should be covered by integration test cases in FileSourceStrategySuite. A follow-up patch (tracked via SPARK-19856) will change the partitioning related test cases in FileSourceStrategySuite from integration tests into unit tests.","created_at":"2017-03-07T22:33:57Z","updated_at":"2017-04-13T07:32:32Z","closed_at":"2017-04-13T07:32:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fde1632a780e423eff7e1683b505f5db409ceee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad5c7d11f64ce86ec109031f3b861d6168e1c8da","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-19855","ref":"SPARK-19855","sha":"ad5c7d11f64ce86ec109031f3b861d6168e1c8da","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `@keyword_only` decorator in PySpark is not thread-safe.  It writes kwargs to a static class variable in the decorator, which is then retrieved later in the class method as `_input_kwargs`.  If multiple threads are constructing the same class with different kwargs, it becomes a race condition to read from the static class variable before it's overwritten.  See [SPARK-19348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19348) for reproduction code.\r\n\r\nThis change will write the kwargs to a member variable so that multiple threads can operate on separate instances without the race condition.  It does not protect against multiple threads operating on a single instance, but that is better left to the user to synchronize.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests for using the keyword_only decorator and a regression test that verifies `_input_kwargs` can be overwritten from different class instances.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-07T19:58:41Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T23:36:09Z","closed_at":"2017-03-08T04:57:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59a36b81f1c212f3b9cd4dc030e4f4318667a2b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2f3838caf088bae1264107e5db24f928109ab7dd","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348-2_0","ref":"pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348-2_0","sha":"2f3838caf088bae1264107e5db24f928109ab7dd","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `@keyword_only` decorator in PySpark is not thread-safe.  It writes kwargs to a static class variable in the decorator, which is then retrieved later in the class method as `_input_kwargs`.  If multiple threads are constructing the same class with different kwargs, it becomes a race condition to read from the static class variable before it's overwritten.  See [SPARK-19348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19348) for reproduction code.\r\n\r\nThis change will write the kwargs to a member variable so that multiple threads can operate on separate instances without the race condition.  It does not protect against multiple threads operating on a single instance, but that is better left to the user to synchronize.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests for using the keyword_only decorator and a regression test that verifies `_input_kwargs` can be overwritten from different class instances.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-07T19:19:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T23:36:12Z","closed_at":"2017-03-08T04:57:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"768ab8d228e74afe1d7956602b37ffb9a9ce5b37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96db92f3ebd4e341ad561deb04cdcf9c957a7ad7","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348-2_1","ref":"pyspark-keyword_only-threadsafe-SPARK-19348-2_1","sha":"96db92f3ebd4e341ad561deb04cdcf9c957a7ad7","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support an array of struct type in `to_json` as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\nval df = Seq(Tuple1(Tuple1(1) :: Nil)).toDF(\"a\")\r\ndf.select(to_json($\"a\").as(\"json\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+\r\n|      json|\r\n+----------+\r\n|[{\"_1\":1}]|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, it throws an exception as below (a newline manually inserted for readability):\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'structtojson(`array`)' due to data type \r\nmismatch: structtojson requires that the expression is a struct expression.;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows the roundtrip with `from_json` as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nval schema = ArrayType(StructType(StructField(\"a\", IntegerType) :: Nil))\r\nval df = Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\":1}, {\"a\":2}]\"\"\").toDF(\"json\").select(from_json($\"json\", schema).as(\"array\"))\r\ndf.show()\r\n\r\n// Read back.\r\ndf.select(to_json($\"array\").as(\"json\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+\r\n|     array|\r\n+----------+\r\n|[[1], [2]]|\r\n+----------+\r\n\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|             json|\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|[{\"a\":1},{\"a\":2}]|\r\n+-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR proposes to rename from `StructToJson` to `StructsToJson ` and `JsonToStruct` to `JsonToStructs`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `JsonFunctionsSuite` and `JsonExpressionsSuite` for Scala, doctest for Python and test in `test_sparkSQL.R` for R.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-07T16:28:09Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:38Z","closed_at":"2017-03-20T05:35:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"641159a7a2e835c262de9381a18895f0d474447d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ac57d3a2b8d5df9851aa06e8e2fb6fafb76005d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19849","ref":"SPARK-19849","sha":"6ac57d3a2b8d5df9851aa06e8e2fb6fafb76005d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplementation of Sink that supports storing structured streaming data into a JDBC compliant RDBMS database. It supports Overwrite and Append modes. By default it supports _atleast once_ operations and can be configured to support _exactly once_ \r\n\r\nTo keep track of batches that have been written to a table, it creates a _log_ table with the name <tablename>$_SINK_LOG. This table has 2 columns: batchID and status of batch. The status can either be COMMITTED or UNCOMMITTED. When JDBC Sink receives a batch it checks if there is an entry in the sink log table for that batch with status = COMMITTED. If status is COMMITTED, it ignores the batch, other wise it tries the append/overwrite operation\r\n\r\nTo enable _exactly once_ the client should create a column in the original table that stores the batchID. This column should be of LongType. The name of the column should be passed in the options with the name _batchIdCol_. If the JDBC Sink finds that this option is set, it will use _exactly once_ mode. In this mode, it will set the _batchIdCol_ to the batch id that is inserting or overwriting the record. Also, in the beginning of the batch, if it finds a batch with status=UNCOMMITTED, it deletes the records in the original table that match the batchID\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImplemented JDBCSinkSuite that is modeled along the lines of other Sink tests\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-07T13:47:24Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T08:58:14Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T06:18:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3549b104828f492934a3c0c56e5a52284239a760","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7d89c68c907e64321c303fe21fac25fe02d739a","head":{"label":"GaalDornick:master","ref":"master","sha":"a7d89c68c907e64321c303fe21fac25fe02d739a","user":{"login":"GaalDornick","id":16038067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDM4MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16038067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick","html_url":"https://github.com/GaalDornick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81591929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTU5MTkyOQ==","name":"spark-jdbc","full_name":"GaalDornick/spark-jdbc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GaalDornick","id":16038067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDM4MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16038067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick","html_url":"https://github.com/GaalDornick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GaalDornick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GaalDornick/spark-jdbc","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nimplement the read logic in `HiveFileFormat`, to unify the table read path between data source and hive serde tables.\r\n\r\nThe major change is, hive partition may have a different serde, so the planner should put more information in `PartitionedFile` and send it to executors.\r\n\r\nTow things need to be improved in the future:\r\n1. Due to the way we read hive table files, we do not support reading a partial file yet, which may reduce the parallelism for large files.\r\n2. Hive tables with storage handler(non-file-based) still go to the old code path.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.","created_at":"2017-03-07T06:35:38Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T05:58:40Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T05:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"335a82db1eed2c6f9f4ac6f2f44d0f2494ab07e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad478870c652553b8b225a569e460fb6ccef0c36","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:hive-read","ref":"hive-read","sha":"ad478870c652553b8b225a569e460fb6ccef0c36","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConstraint propagation can be computation expensive and block the driver execution for long time. For example, the below benchmark needs 30mins.\r\n\r\nCompared with previous PRs #16998, #16785, this is a much simpler option: add a flag to disable constraint propagation.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\nRun the following codes locally.\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.ml.{Pipeline, PipelineStage}\r\n    import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.{OneHotEncoder, StringIndexer, VectorAssembler}\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.internal.SQLConf\r\n\r\n    spark.conf.set(SQLConf.CONSTRAINT_PROPAGATION_ENABLED.key, false)\r\n\r\n    val df = (1 to 40).foldLeft(Seq((1, \"foo\"), (2, \"bar\"), (3, \"baz\")).toDF(\"id\", \"x0\"))((df, i) => df.withColumn(s\"x$i\", $\"x0\"))\r\n\r\n    val indexers = df.columns.tail.map(c => new StringIndexer()\r\n      .setInputCol(c)\r\n      .setOutputCol(s\"${c}_indexed\")\r\n      .setHandleInvalid(\"skip\"))\r\n\r\n    val encoders = indexers.map(indexer => new OneHotEncoder()\r\n      .setInputCol(indexer.getOutputCol)\r\n      .setOutputCol(s\"${indexer.getOutputCol}_encoded\")\r\n      .setDropLast(true))\r\n\r\n    val stages: Array[PipelineStage] = indexers ++ encoders\r\n    val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(stages)\r\n\r\n    val startTime = System.nanoTime\r\n    pipeline.fit(df).transform(df).show\r\n    val runningTime = System.nanoTime - startTime\r\n\r\nBefore this patch: 1786001 ms ~= 30 mins\r\nAfter this patch: 26392 ms = less than half of a minute\r\n\r\nRelated PRs: #16998, #16785.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fix tries to address the issue raised in SPARK-19824 where\r\nthe JSON API of the standalone master (\"/json\") does not show\r\nthe number of cores for a running (active) application, which is\r\navailable on the master UI.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that in master UI, `coresGranted` was used:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.1.0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/master/ui/MasterPage.scala#L220\r\nwhile in JSON API, the `desc.maxCores` was used. In case\r\nthere is no limit on `maxCores`, this filed will be missing on\r\nJSON API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen BytesToBytesMap spills, its longArray should be released. Otherwise, it may not released until the task complete. This array may take a significant amount of memory, which cannot be used by later operator, such as UnsafeShuffleExternalSorter, resulting in more frequent spill in sorter. This patch release the array as destructive iterator will not use this array anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a key does not get any new data in `mapGroupsWithState`, the mapping function is never called on it. So we need a timeout feature that calls the function again in such cases, so that the user can decide whether to continue waiting or clean up (remove state, save stuff externally, etc.).\r\nTimeouts can be either based on processing time or event time. This JIRA is for processing time, but defines the high level API design for both. The usage would look like this.\r\n```\r\ndef stateFunction(key: K, value: Iterator[V], state: KeyedState[S]): U = {\r\n  ...\r\n  state.setTimeoutDuration(10000)\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\ndataset\t\t\t\t\t// type is Dataset[T]\r\n  .groupByKey[K](keyingFunc)   // generates KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, T]\r\n  .mapGroupsWithState[S, U](\r\n     func = stateFunction, \r\n     timeout = KeyedStateTimeout.withProcessingTime)\t// returns Dataset[U]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the following design aspects.\r\n\r\n- The timeout type is provided as a param in mapGroupsWithState as a parameter global to all the keys. This is so that the planner knows this at planning time, and accordingly optimize the execution based on whether to saves extra info in state or not (e.g. timeout durations or timestamps).\r\n\r\n- The exact timeout duration is provided inside the function call so that it can be customized on a per key basis.\r\n\r\n- When the timeout occurs for a key, the function is called with no values, and KeyedState.isTimingOut() set to true.\r\n\r\n- The timeout is reset for key every time the function is called on the key, that is, when the key has new data, or the key has timed out. So the user has to set the timeout duration everytime the function is called, otherwise there will not be any timeout set.\r\n\r\nGuarantees provided on timeout of key, when timeout duration is D ms:\r\n- Timeout will never be called before real clock time has advanced by D ms\r\n- Timeout will be called eventually when there is a trigger with any data in it (i.e. after D ms). So there is a no strict upper bound on when the timeout would occur. For example, if there is no data in the stream (for any key) for a while, then the timeout will not be hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n- Added new param to `mapGroupsWithState` for timeout\r\n- Added new method to `StateStore` to filter data based on timeout timestamp\r\n- Changed the internal map type of `HDFSBackedStateStore` from Java's `HashMap` to `ConcurrentHashMap` as the latter allows weakly-consistent fail-safe iterators on the map data. See comments in code for more details.\r\n- Refactored logic of `MapGroupsWithStateExec` to \r\n  - Save timeout info to state store for each key that has data.\r\n  - Then, filter states that should be timed out based on the current batch processing timestamp.\r\n- Moved KeyedState for `o.a.s.sql` to `o.a.s.sql.streaming`. I remember that this was a feedback in the MapGroupsWithState PR that I had forgotten to address. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in \r\n- MapGroupsWithStateSuite for timeouts.\r\n- StateStoreSuite for new APIs in StateStore.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-06T19:12:05Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T04:54:38Z","closed_at":"2017-03-19T21:08:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc9ff0bc4f9d2cfcc9b101f81e0146414a3e03bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/497646e8c7243b062ac63587c55d0b0da51abab2","head":{"label":"tdas:mapgroupwithstate-timeout","ref":"mapgroupwithstate-timeout","sha":"497646e8c7243b062ac63587c55d0b0da51abab2","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [SPARK-5068](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5068), we introduce a SQLConf spark.sql.hive.verifyPartitionPath,\r\nif it is set to true, it will avoid the task failed when the patition location does not exists in the filesystem.\r\n\r\nthis situation should always return emtpy and don't lead to the task failed, here we remove this conf.\r\n\r\nAnd the  function `verifyPartitionPath ` has a bug ,that if the partition path is custom path\r\n\r\nit will still do filter for all partition path in the parameter `partitionToDeserializer`,\r\nit will scan the path which does not belong to the table ,e.g. custom path is /root/a\r\nand the partitionSpec is b=1/c=2, this will lead to scan / because of the getPathPatternByPath\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmodify a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNow `InMemoryTableScanExec` simply takes the `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` from the associated `InMemoryRelation`'s `child.outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `InMemoryTableScanExec` can alias the output attributes. In this case, its `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` are not correct and its parent operators can't correctly determine its data distribution.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently in DynamicPartitionWriteTask, when we get the paritionPath of a parition, we just escape the partition value, not escape the partition name.\r\n\r\nthis will cause some problems for some  special partition name situation, for example :\r\n1) if the partition name contains '%' etc,  there will be two partition path created in the filesytem, one is for escaped path like '/path/a%25b=1', another is for unescaped path like '/path/a%b=1'.\r\nand the data inserted stored in unescaped path, while the show partitions table will return 'a%25b=1' which the partition name is escaped. So here it is not consist. And I think the data should be stored in the escaped path in filesystem, which Hive2.0.0 also have the same action.\r\n\r\n2) if the partition name contains ':', there will throw exception that new Path(\"/path\",\"a:b\"), this is illegal which has a colon in the relative path.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: java.net.URISyntaxException: Relative path in absolute URI: a:b\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improve performance of Dataset.map() for primitive types by removing boxing/unbox operations. This is based on [the discussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16391#discussion_r93788919) with @cloud-fan.\r\n\r\nCurrent Catalyst generates a method call to a `apply()` method of an anonymous function written in Scala. The types of an argument and return value are `java.lang.Object`. As a result, each method call for a primitive value involves a pair of unboxing and boxing for calling this `apply()` method and a pair of boxing and unboxing for returning from this `apply()` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR directly calls a specialized version of a `apply()` method without boxing and unboxing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpecifying the table schema in DDL formats is needed for different scenarios. For example, \r\n- [specifying the schema in SQL function `from_json` using DDL formats](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19637), which is suggested by @marmbrus , \r\n- [specifying the customized JDBC data types](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16209). \r\n\r\nThese two PRs need users to use the JSON format to specify the table schema. This is not user friendly. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to provide a `parseTableSchema` API in `ParserInterface`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test suite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Once` analysis rule batch consists of a single analysis rule `LookupFunctions` that performs simple existence check over `UnresolvedFunctions` without actually resolving them.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this rule is that it doesn't require function arguments to be resolved first and therefore doesn't rely on relation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis refactors the task kill path to allow specifying a reason for the task kill. The reason is propagated opaquely through events, and will show up in the UI automatically as `(N killed: $reason)` and `TaskKilled: $reason`. Without this change, there is no way to provide the user feedback through the UI.\r\n\r\nCurrently used reasons are \"stage cancelled\", \"another attempt succeeded\", and \"killed via SparkContext.killTask\". The user can also specify a custom reason through `SparkContext.killTask`.\r\n\r\ncc @rxin \r\n\r\nIn the stage overview UI the reasons are summarized:\r\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14922/23929209/a83b2862-08e1-11e7-8b3e-ae1967bbe2e5.png)\r\n\r\nWithin the stage UI you can see individual task kill

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove incorrect implementation that has been not executed so far (at least from Spark 1.5.2) for `in` operator and throw a correct exception rather than saying it is a bool. I tested the codes above in 1.5.2, 1.6.3, 2.1.0 and in the master branch as below:\r\n\r\n**1.5.2**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df = sqlContext.createDataFrame([[1]])\r\n>>> 1 in df._1\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 418, in __nonzero__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', \"\r\nValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**1.6.3**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 1 in sqlContext.range(1).id\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark-1.6.3-bin-hadoop2.6/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 447, in __nonzero__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', \"\r\nValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2.1.0**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 1 in spark.range(1).id\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 426, in __nonzero__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', \"\r\nValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Current Master**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 1 in spark.range(1).id\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 452, in __nonzero__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', \"\r\nValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> 1 in spark.range(1).id\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 184, in __contains__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot apply 'in' operator against a column: please use 'contains' \"\r\nValueError: Cannot apply 'in' operator against a column: please use 'contains' in a string column or 'array_contains' function for an array column.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn more details,\r\n\r\nIt seems the implementation intended to support this\r\n\r\n```python\r\n1 in df.column\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, it throws an exception as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/column.py\", line 426, in __nonzero__\r\n    raise ValueError(\"Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', \"\r\nValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Column(object):\r\n    def __contains__(self, item):\r\n        print \"I am contains\"\r\n        return Column()\r\n    def __nonzero__(self):\r\n        raise Exception(\"I am nonzero.\")\r\n\r\n>>> 1 in Column()\r\nI am contains\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in __nonzero__\r\nException: I am nonzero.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems it calls `__contains__` first and then `__nonzero__` or `__bool__` is being called against `Column()` to make this a bool (or int to be specific).\r\n\r\nIt seems `__nonzero__` (for Python 2), `__bool__` (for Python 3) and `__contains__` forcing the the return into a bool unlike other operators. There are few references about this as below:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue16011\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12244074/python-source-code-for-built-in-in-operator/12244378#12244378\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/38542543/functionality-of-python-in-vs-contains/38542777\r\n\r\nIt seems we can't overwrite `__nonzero__` or `__bool__` as a workaround to make this working because these force the return type as a bool as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Column(object):\r\n    def __contains__(self, item):\r\n        print \"I am contains\"\r\n        return Column()\r\n    def __nonzero__(self):\r\n        return \"a\"\r\n\r\n>>> 1 in Column()\r\nI am contains\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: __nonzero__ should return bool or int, returned str\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests in `tests.py`.","created_at":"2017-03-04T03:57:06Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:44:38Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T02:07:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6d43f08d3dd000e76481925aa35ca865003db21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/509747ca82aecd07541cc5b0c06fd5f4c147c3cf","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19701","ref":"SPARK-19701","sha":"509747ca82aecd07541cc5b0c06fd5f4c147c3cf","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

patch.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-03T22:27:28Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T20:15:46Z","closed_at":"2017-03-04T02:46:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"137c5726d3233a1eadc77f72d08acbab8200e6e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa2a66b8973f0dc8e9b6b14a7b4112036df8d1ba","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-19804","ref":"SPARK-19804","sha":"aa2a66b8973f0dc8e9b6b14a7b4112036df8d1ba","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nThere is a file stream source option called maxFileAge which limits how old the files can be, relative the latest file that has been seen. This is used to limit the files that need to be remembered as \"processed\". Files older than the latest processed files are ignored. This values is by default 7 days.\r\nThis causes a problem when both\r\nlatestFirst = true\r\nmaxFilesPerTrigger > total files to be processed.\r\nHere is what happens in all combinations\r\n1) latestFirst = false - Since files are processed in order, there wont be any unprocessed file older than the latest processed file. All files will be processed.\r\n2) latestFirst = true AND maxFilesPerTrigger is not set - The maxFileAge thresholding mechanism takes one batch initialize. If maxFilesPerTrigger is not, then all old files get processed in the first batch, and so no file is left behind.\r\n3) latestFirst = true AND maxFilesPerTrigger is set to X - The first batch process the latest X files. That sets the threshold latest file - maxFileAge, so files older than this threshold will never be considered for processing.\r\nThe bug is with case 3.\r\n\r\n**The Solution**\r\n\r\nIgnore `maxFileAge` when both `maxFilesPerTrigger` and `latestFirst` are set.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRegression test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDisallow cyclic view references, a cyclic view reference may be created by the following queries:\r\n```\r\nCREATE VIEW testView AS SELECT id FROM tbl\r\nCREATE VIEW testView2 AS SELECT id FROM testView\r\nALTER VIEW testView AS SELECT * FROM testView2\r\n```\r\nIn the above example, a reference cycle (testView -> testView2 -> testView) exsits.\r\n\r\nWe disallow cyclic view references by checking that in ALTER VIEW command, when the `analyzedPlan` contains the same `View` node with the altered view, we should prevent the behavior and throw an AnalysisException.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest by `SQLViewSuite.test(\"correctly handle a cyclic view reference\")`.","created_at":"2017-03-03T15:37:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T04:53:32Z","closed_at":"2017-03-08T04:28:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b4dfc7fe6fb7465a30b10a693db80a624e29f26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46da41e2b74ef08945b6d147a182ad7940533ceb","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:cyclic-view","ref":"cyclic-view","sha":"46da41e2b74ef08945b6d147a182ad7940533ceb","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we treat the location of table/partition/database as URI string.\r\n\r\nIt will be safer if we can make the type of location as java.net.URI. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, there are following classes changes:\r\n**1. CatalogDatabase**\r\n```\r\ncase class CatalogDatabase(\r\n    name: String,\r\n    description: String,\r\n    locationUri: String,\r\n    properties: Map[String, String])\r\n--->\r\ncase class CatalogDatabase(\r\n    name: String,\r\n    description: String,\r\n    locationUri: URI,\r\n    properties: Map[String, String])\r\n```\r\n**2.

The `String` to `URI` just happened in SparkSQL internally.\r\n\r\nHere list some operation related location:\r\n**1. whitespace in the location**\r\n   e.g.  `/a/b c/d`\r\n   For both table location and partition location, \r\n   After `CREATE TABLE  t... (PARTITIONED BY ...) LOCATION '/a/b c/d'` ,\r\n   then `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/a/b c/d`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/a/b c/d`\r\n\r\n**2. colon(:) in the location**\r\n   e.g.  `/a/b:c/d`\r\n   For both table location and partition location, \r\n   when `CREATE TABLE  t... (PARTITIONED BY ...)  LOCATION '/a/b:c/d'` ,\r\n   \r\n  **In linux file system**\r\n   `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/a/b:c/d`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/a/b:c/d`\r\n\r\n  **in HDFS** throw exception:\r\n  `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Pathname /a/b:c/d from hdfs://iZbp1151s8hbnnwriekxdeZ:9000/a/b:c/d is not a valid DFS filename.`\r\n \r\n\r\n  **while** After `INSERT INTO TABLE t PARTITION(a=\"a:b\") SELECT 1`\r\n   then `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/xxx/a=a%3Ab`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/xxx/a=a%3Ab`\r\n\r\n**3. percent sign(%) in the location**\r\n   e.g.  `/a/b%c/d`\r\n   For both table location and partition location, \r\n   After `CREATE TABLE  t... (PARTITIONED BY ...) LOCATION '/a/b%c/d'` ,\r\n   then `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/a/b%c/d`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/a/b%c/d`\r\n\r\n**4. encoded(%25) in the location**\r\n   e.g.  `/a/b%25c/d`\r\n   For both table location and partition location, \r\n   After `CREATE TABLE  t... (PARTITIONED BY ...)  LOCATION '/a/b%25c/d'` ,\r\n   then `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/a/b%25c/d`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/a/b%25c/d`\r\n\r\n   **while** After `INSERT INTO TABLE t PARTITION(a=\"%25\") SELECT 1`\r\n   then `DESC EXTENDED t ` show the location is `/xxx/a=%2525`,\r\n   and the real path in the FileSystem also show `/xxx/a=%2525`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additionally**, except the location, there are two other factors will affect the location of the table/partition. one is the table name which does not allowed to have special characters, and the  other is `partition name` which have the same actions with `partition value`, and `partition name` with special character situation has add some testcase and resolve a bug in [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17173)\r\n\r\n### Summary:\r\nAfter `CREATE TABLE  t... (PARTITIONED BY ...)  LOCATION path`,\r\nthe path which we get from `DESC TABLE` and `real path in FileSystem` are all the same with the `CREATE TABLE` command(different filesystem has different action that allow what kind of special character to create the path, e.g. HDFS does not allow colon, but linux filesystem allow it ).\r\n\r\n`DataBase` also have the same logic with `CREATE TABLE`\r\n\r\nwhile if the `partition value` has some special character like `%` `:` `#` etc, then we will get the path with encoded `partition value` like `/xxx/a=A%25B` from `DESC TABLE` and `real path in FileSystem`\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the core change code is using `new Path(str).toUri` and `new Path(uri).toString`\r\nwhich transfrom `str to uri `or `uri to str`.\r\nfor example: \r\n```\r\nval str = '/a/b c/d'\r\nval uri = new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe properties that are serialized with a TaskDescription can have very long values (eg. \"spark.job.description\" which is set to the full sql statement with the thrift-server).  DataOutputStream.writeUTF() does not work well for long strings, so this changes the way those values are serialized to handle longer strings.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit test to reproduce the issue.

jenkins.","created_at":"2017-03-02T16:11:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T20:15:08Z","closed_at":"2017-03-06T20:08:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d109c94f76c80494e271a69c3fccc6ccb7140f41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99692bf9860f375eab7f7c35d17f83d2c726ae77","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-19796","ref":"SPARK-19796","sha":"99692bf9860f375eab7f7c35d17f83d2c726ae77","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReorder the joins using a dynamic programming algorithm (Selinger paper):\r\nFirst we put all items (basic joined nodes) into level 1, then we build all two-way joins at level 2 from plans at level 1 (single items), then build all 3-way joins from plans at previous levels (two-way joins and single items), then 4-way joins ... etc, until we build all n-way joins and pick the best plan among them.\r\n\r\nWhen building m-way joins, we only keep the best plan (with the lowest cost) for the same set of m items. E.g., for 3-way joins, we keep only the best plan for items {A, B, C} among plans (A J B) J C, (A J C) J B and (B J C) J A. Thus, the plans maintained for each level when reordering four items A, B, C, D are as follows:\r\n```\r\nlevel 1: p({A}), p({B}), p({C}), p({D})\r\nlevel 2: p({A, B}), p({A, C}), p({A, D}), p({B, C}), p({B, D}), p({C, D})\r\nlevel 3: p({A, B, C}), p({A, B, D}), p({A, C, D}), p({B, C, D})\r\nlevel 4: p({A, B, C, D})\r\n```\r\nwhere p({A, B, C, D}) is the final output plan.\r\n\r\nFor cost evaluation, since physical costs for operators are not available currently, we use cardinalities and sizes to compute costs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadd test cases\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-02T14:30:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T07:05:41Z","closed_at":"2017-03-08T15:04:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cee36c31d5a2814a3d22f8c81bb32a8cae9a08ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/757e3b65083e860aba3d1161c914c547545a28f5","head":{"label":"wzhfy:joinReorder","ref":"joinReorder","sha":"757e3b65083e860aba3d1161c914c547545a28f5","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTaskSetManager is now using `System.getCurrentTimeMillis` when mark task as finished in `handleSuccessfulTask` and `handleFailedTask`. Thus developer cannot set the tasks finishing time in unit test. When `handleSuccessfulTask`, task's duration = `System.getCurrentTimeMillis` - launchTime(which can be set by `clock`), the result is not correct.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting
