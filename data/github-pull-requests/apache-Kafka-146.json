Confirmed KAFKA-4309 with caching turned on.\r\n2. Found bug KAFKA-6398.\r\n3. Found bug KAFKA-6443.\r\n4. Found a bug that in CachingKeyValueStore, we would flush before putting the record into the underlying store, when the store is going to be used in the downstream processors with flushing it would result in incorrect results, fixed the issue along with this PR.\r\n5. Consider a new optimization described in KAFKA-6286.\r\n\r\nFuture works including stream-table joins will be in other PRs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

has been accepted, and this PR implements KIP-145 except without the SMTs.**\r\n\r\nChanged the Connect API and runtime to support message headers as described in [KIP-145](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-145+-+Expose+Record+Headers+in+Kafka+Connect).\r\n\r\nThe new `Header` interface defines an immutable representation of a Kafka header (key-value pair) with support for the Connect value types and schemas. This interface provides methods for easily converting between many of the built-in primitive, structured, and logical data types.\r\n\r\nThe new `Headers` interface defines an ordered collection of headers and is used to track all headers associated with a `ConnectRecord` (and thus `SourceRecord` and `SinkRecord`). This does allow multiple headers with the same key. The `Headers` contains methods for adding, removing, finding, and modifying headers. Convenience methods allow connectors and transforms to easily use and modify the headers for a record.\r\n\r\nA new `HeaderConverter` interface is also defined to enable the Connect runtime framework to be able to serialize and deserialize headers between the in-memory representation and Kafka’s byte[] representation. A new `SimpleHeaderConverter` implementation has been added, and this serializes to strings and deserializes by inferring the schemas (`Struct` header values are serialized without the schemas, so they can only be deserialized as `Map` instances without a schema.) The `StringConverter`, `JsonConverter`, and `ByteArrayConverter` have all been extended to also be `HeaderConverter` implementations. Each connector can be configured with a different header converter, although by default the `SimpleHeaderConverter` is used to serialize header values as strings without schemas.\r\n\r\nUnit and integration tests are added for `ConnectHeader` and `ConnectHeaders`, the two implementation classes for headers. Additional test methods are added for the methods added to the `Converter` implementations. Finally, the `ConnectRecord` object is already used heavily, so only limited tests need to be added while quite a few of the existing tests already cover the changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

changes the Struct's equals and hashCode method to use Arrays#deepEquals and Arrays#deepHashCode, respectively. This resolves a problem where two structs with values of type byte[] would not be considered equal even though the byte arrays' contents are equal. By using deepEquals, the byte arrays' contents are compared instead of ther identity.\r\n\r\nSince this changes the behavior of the equals method for byte array values, the behavior of hashCode must change alongside it to ensure the methods still fulfill the general contract of \"equal objects must have equal hashCodes\".\r\n\r\nTest rationale:\r\nAll existing unit tests for equals were untouched and continue to work. A new test method was added to verify the behavior of equals and hashCode for Struct instances that contain a byte array value. I verify the reflixivity and transitivity of equals as well as the fact that equal Structs have equal hashCodes\r\nand not-equal structs do not have equal hashCodes. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

This will reduce efficient of consumer.poll() by asking user to call more poll() to get the same amount of data.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we observe that for users who naively sleep a constant time after each consumer.poll(), some partition will lag behind after they switch from plaintext to ssl. Here is the explanation why this can happen.\r\n\r\nSay there are 1 partition of 1MB/sec and 9 partition of 32KB/sec. Leaders of these partitions are all different and consumer is consuming these 10 partitions. Let's also assume that socket read buffer size is large enough and consume sleeps 1 sec between consumer.poll(). 1 sec is long enough for consumer to receive the FetchResponse back from broker.\r\n\r\nWhen consumer uses plaintext, each consumer.poll() will read all data from the socket buffer and it means 1 MB data is read from each partition.\r\n\r\nWhen consumer uses ssl, each consumer.poll() is likely to find that there is some data available in the memory. In this case consumer only reads 16 KB data from other sockets, particularly the socket for the broker with the large partition. Then the throughput of the large partition will be limited to 16KB/sec.\r\n\r\nArguably user should not sleep 1 sec if its consumer is lagging behind. But on Kafka dev side it is nice to keep the previous behavior and optimize consumer.poll() to read as much data from socket as possible.","created_at":"2017-11-22T07:14:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T19:14:53Z","closed_at":"2017-12-18T19:18:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd55ec6a18ea9a0dc5a8db3ad5c63a18811fb70a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1826b325c201e318588d0d70e74614e581f93f46","head":{"label":"lindong28:KAFKA-6258","ref":"KAFKA-6258","sha":"1826b325c201e318588d0d70e74614e581f93f46","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21054638,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTA1NDYzOA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"lindong28/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28/kafka","description":"Mirror
