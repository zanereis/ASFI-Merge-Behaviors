The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set, and multiple members\nare started simultaneously. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21510\">#21510</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster was unresponsive when you perform a health check to see the members are in the safe state;\ncluster members were hanging in the <code>REPLICA_NOT_SYNC</code> state during such health checks. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21208\">#21208</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the list of members in the cluster was reset to an empty list when the UUID of a cluster changes after its restart:\nthis was causing startup failures since Hazelcast could not manage the events due to the empty member list after a restart. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21178\">#21178</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21107\">#21107</a></li>\n<li>Fixed a data race in <code>SingleProtocolEncoder</code>; while one method of this interface is called from the input thread,\nanother one is called from the output thread which was causing the race. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20994\">#20994</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the automatic module name in <code>hazelcast-5.x.jar</code> could not be detected using Gradle. The reason was\n<code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> not being the first or second entry in the JAR file; now this manifest file is the second entry. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20976\">#20976</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.1.1</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.1 release.

A new warning explaining that the source configuration directory will be modified is now displayed when generate features is toggled on using the <code>g</code> hotkey and when <code>dev</code> mode is started with the <code>generateFeatures</code> flag set to <code>true</code>.  For more information, refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/dev.md\">dev goal</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/generate-features.md\">generate-features goal</a> documentation.</p>\n<h2>Additional Fixes</h2>\n<p>The following fixes are also included in this release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An improved dev mode startup message and help menu to make the hotkeys stand out more</li>\n<li>Run generate features (if enabled) after a conflicting feature is removed from server configuration</li>\n<li>If toggling on generate features using the <code>g</code> hotkey creates the <code>configDropins/overrides</code> directory, the generated features are now installed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven/compare/liberty-maven-3.6...liberty-maven-3.6.1\">commit log</a> for the full set of the changes since the previous milestone release.</p>\n<p>The Liberty Maven Plugin 3.6.1 release is available on the <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.openliberty.tools/liberty-maven-plugin/3.6.1/maven-plugin\">Maven Central</a> repository.</p>\n<h2>Liberty Maven Plugin 3.6 Release</h2>\n<p>Version 3.6 of the Liberty Maven Plugin is a minor release that contains new functionality, plus some minor fixes.</p>\n<p>The new functionality includes the <code>generate-features</code> goal. This goal creates a Liberty configuration file, <code>generated-features.xml</code>, containing the Liberty features required by the application. Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/generate-features.md\">generate-features</a> goal for more information.</p>\n<p>With the new <code>generate-features</code> goal comes new behavior for Liberty <code>dev</code> mode. By default, <code>dev</code> mode will invoke the <code>generate-features</code> goal both at start-up and whenever code or configuration changes are detected. Users can toggle feature generation on and off with the new <code>g</code> hotkey. Users can also optimize the generated feature list using the new <code>o</code> hotkey.</p>\n<h2>Additional Fixes</h2>\n<p>The following additional fixes are also included in this release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed loose app ejb type in war <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/issues/1527\">#1527</a> <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/issues/1521\">#1521</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

`jetty.version` from 9.4.34.v20201102 to 11.0.0.\nUpdates `jetty-maven-plugin` from 9.4.34.v20201102 to 11.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases\">jetty-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>11.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Eclipse Jetty 11.x Highlights</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetty 11.x has a minimum Java requirement of Java 11.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x modules are proper JPMS modules with <code>module-info.class</code>.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x supports the following technology specs (from the Jakarta EE 9 effort):\n<ul>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet</code> - 5.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp</code> - 3.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.el</code> - 4.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.websocket</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x is the first major version of Jetty to support the <code>jakarta.servlet</code> namespace.<br />\nUse Jetty 10.x for the older (now outdated) <code>javax.servlet</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic jetty logging facade has been replaced with slf4j-api usage</li>\n<li>There is no longer a <code>jetty-distribution</code>, use <code>jetty-home</code> with a proper <code>${jetty.base}</code> instead.<br />\nSee: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/10.0.0/operations-guide/index.html#og-begin-arch\">Operations Guide: Architecture</a>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>demo</code> jetty-start module exists to replace the old demo-base functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove jetty-all uber artifact</li>\n<li>Managing <code>Configuration</code> within a <code>WebAppContext</code> has a new API.<br />\n(They are now self ordering and do not require knowledge of Jetty internals to use successfully)</li>\n<li>Complete WebSocket refactoring, those using the Jetty APIs or embedded-jetty will need to update their code.\n<ul>\n<li>Support for WebSocket over HTTP/2 (client and server)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty HttpClient has been improved.\n<ul>\n<li>Supports dynamic protocol upgrade (http/2 and http/1.1).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Session management has been refactored as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a
