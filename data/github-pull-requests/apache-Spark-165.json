for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove TimestampNTZ type support in the production code of Spark 3.2. \r\nTo archive the goal, this PR adds the check \"Utils.isTesting\" in the following code branches:\r\n- keyword \"timestamp_ntz\" and \"timestamp_ltz\" in parser\r\n- New expressions from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662\r\n- Using java.time.localDateTime as the external type for TimestampNTZType\r\n- `SQLConf.timestampType` which determines the default timestamp type of Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nThis is to minimize the code difference between the master branch. So that future users won't think TimestampNTZ is already available in Spark 3.2.\r\nThe downside is that users can still find TimestampNTZType under package `org.apache.spark.sql.types`. There should be nothing left other than this.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs of now, there are some blockers for delivering the TimestampNTZ project in Spark 3.2:\r\n\r\n- In the Hive Thrift server, both TimestampType and TimestampNTZType are mapped to the same timestamp type, which can cause confusion for users.\r\n- For the Parquet data source, the new written TimestampNTZType Parquet columns will be read as TimestampType in old Spark releases. Also, we need to decide the merge schema for files mixed with TimestampType and TimestampNTZ type.\r\n- The type coercion rules for TimestampNTZType are incomplete. For example, what should the data type of the in clause \"IN(Timestamp'2020-01-01 00:00:00', TimestampNtz'2020-01-01 00:00:00') be.\r\n- It is tricky to support TimestampNTZType in JSON/CSV data readers. We need to avoid regressions as possible as we can.\r\n\r\nThere are 10 days left for the expected 3.2 RC date. So, I propose to **release the TimestampNTZ type in Spark 3.3 instead of Spark 3.2**. So that we have enough time to make considerate designs for the issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting Unit tests + manual tests from spark-shell to validate the changes are gone.\r\nNew functions \r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"select

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize some treeAggregates in MLlib by delaying allocating (thus not sending around) large arrays of zeroes\r\nThis uses the same idea as in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23600/files\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllocating huge arrays of zeroes takes additional memory and network I/O which is unnecessary in some cases. It can cause operations to run out of memory that might otherwise succeed. Specifically, this should prevent the 'zero' value from having to be (pointlessly) checked for serializability, which can fail when passing through the default JavaSerializer; it would also prevent allocating and sending large 'zero' values for an empty partition in the aggregate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the `NullType.simpleString` to \"void\" to set \"void\" as the formal type name of `NullType`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR is intended to address the type name discussion in PR #28833. Here are the reasons:\r\n1. The type name of NullType is displayed everywhere, e.g. schema string, error message, document. Hence it's not possible to hide it from users, we have to choose a proper name\r\n2. The \"void\" is widely used as the type name of \"NULL\", e.g. Hive, pgSQL\r\n3. Changing to \"void\" can enable the round trip of `toDDL`/`fromDDL` for NullType. (i.e. make `from_json(col, schema.toDDL)`) work\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the type name of \"NULL\" is changed from \"null\" to \"void\". for example:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select null as a, 1 as b\").schema.catalogString\r\nres5: String = struct<a:void,b:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting test

Spark should turn a non-nullable schema into nullable when using API `spark.read.json()` by default.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  val schema = StructType(Seq(StructField(\"value\",\r\n    StructType(Seq(\r\n      StructField(\"x\", IntegerType, nullable = false),\r\n      StructField(\"y\", IntegerType, nullable = false)\r\n    )),\r\n    nullable = true\r\n  )))\r\n\r\n  val testDS = Seq(\"\"\"{\"value\":{\"x\":1}}\"\"\").toDS\r\n  spark.read\r\n    .schema(schema)\r\n    .json(testDS)\r\n    .printSchema()\r\n\r\n  spark.read\r\n    .schema(schema)\r\n    .format(\"json\")\r\n    .load(\"/tmp/json/t1\")\r\n    .printSchema()\r\n  // root\r\n  //  |-- value: struct (nullable = true)\r\n  //  |    |-- x: integer (nullable = true)\r\n  //  |    |-- y: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```\r\n// output of spark.read.json()\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- x: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- y: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n// output of spark.read.json()\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- x: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- y: integer (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `spark.read.csv()` also has the same problem.\r\n- Datasource API `spark.read.format(\"json\").load(\"path\")` do this logical when resolve relation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c77acf0bbc25341de2636649fdd76f9bb4bdf4ed/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L415-L421\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, `spark.read.json()` and `spark.read.csv()` not respect the user-given schema and always turn it into a nullable schema by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a re-work of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30003, here we add support for writing Hive bucketed table with Parquet/ORC file format (data source v1 write path and Hive hash as the hash function). Support for Hive's other file format will be added in follow up PR.\r\n\r\nThe changes are mostly on:\r\n\r\n* `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala`: When converting hive table relation to data source relation, pass bucket info (BucketSpec) and other hive related info as options into `HadoopFsRelation` and `LogicalRelation`, which can be later accessed by `FileFormatWriter` to customize bucket id and file name.\r\n\r\n* `FileFormatWriter.scala`: Use `HiveHash` for `bucketIdExpression` if it's writing to Hive bucketed table. In addition, Spark output file name should follow Hive/Presto/Trino bucketed file naming convention. Introduce another parameter `bucketFileNamePrefix` and it introduces subsequent change in `FileFormatDataWriter`.\r\n\r\n* `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol`: Implement the new file name APIs introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33012, and change its sub-class `PathOutputCommitProtocol`, to make Hive bucketed table writing work with all commit protocol (including S3A commit protocol).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Spark write other-SQL-engines-compatible bucketed table. Currently Spark bucketed table cannot be leveraged by other SQL engines like Hive and Presto, because it uses a different hash function (Spark murmur3hash) and different file name scheme. With this PR, the Spark-written-Hive-bucketed-table can be efficiently read by Presto and Hive to do bucket filter pruning, join, group-by, etc. This was and is blocking several companies (confirmed from Facebook, Lyft, etc) migrate bucketing workload from Hive to Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, any Hive bucketed table (with Parquet/ORC format) written by Spark, is properly bucketed and can be efficiently processed by Hive and Presto/Trino.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n* Added unit test in BucketedWriteWithHiveSupportSuite.scala, to verify bucket file names and each row in each bucket is written properly.\r\n* Tested by Lyft Spark team (Shashank Pedamallu) to read Spark-written bucketed table from Trino, Spark and Hive.","created_at":"2021-07-20T05:33:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T18:08:15Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T06:29:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aeada5aea25db2272cfd5f9aa5f98e6f39587efc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e66c1d50ff986074049eda85797d7474bb3eb072","head":{"label":"c21:hive-bucket-v1","ref":"hive-bucket-v1","sha":"e66c1d50ff986074049eda85797d7474bb3eb072","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename:\r\n\r\n- Rename `*Reader`/`*reader` to `*Read`/`*read` for rules and execution plan (user-facing doc/config name remain untouched)\r\n  - `*ShuffleReaderExec` ->`*ShuffleReadExec`\r\n  - `isLocalReader` -> `isLocalRead`\r\n  - ...\r\n- Rename `CustomShuffle*` prefix to `AQEShuffle*`\r\n- Rename `OptimizeLocalShuffleReader` rule to `OptimizeShuffleWithLocalRead`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are multiple problems in the current naming:\r\n\r\n- `CustomShuffle*` -> `AQEShuffle*`\r\n    it sounds like it is a pluggable API. However, this is actually only used by AQE.\r\n- `OptimizeLocalShuffleReader` -> `OptimizeShuffleWithLocalRead`\r\n    it is the name of a rule but it can be misread as a reader, which is counterintuative\r\n- `*ReaderExec` -> `*ReadExec`\r\n    Reader execution reads a bit odd. It should better be read execution (like `ScanExec`, `ProjectExec` and `FilterExec`). I can't find the reason to name it with something that performs an action. See also the generated plans:\r\n\r\n    Before:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n    * HashAggregate (12)\r\n       +- CustomShuffleReader (11)\r\n          +- ShuffleQueryStage (10)\r\n             +- Exchange (9)\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    After:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n    * HashAggregate (12)\r\n       +- AQEShuffleRead (11)\r\n          +- ShuffleQueryStage (10)\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change changes the type annotations for `pyspark.sql.types.Row`'s `__new__` and `__init__` methods when invoked without keyword arguments (_i.e._, `*args` rather than `**kwargs`) from `str` to `Any`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen creating a [Row](https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/pyspark.sql.types.Row.html) with unnamed fields which are not of type `str` (_e.g._, `row1 = Row(\"Alice\", 11)` appears in the `Row` documentation) type checkers produce an error.\r\n\r\nThe implementation doesn't assume the arguments are of type `str`, and in fact the documentation includes an example where non-`str` types are provided in this way (see [the final example here](https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/api/pyspark.sql.types.Row.html)).\r\n\r\nAn example of the type error produced by [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is\r\n```\r\nerror: No overloads for \"__init__\" match the provided arguments\r\n    Argument types: (Literal['Alice'], Literal[11]) (reportGeneralTypeIssues)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt changes the python type annotation for `Row`, which is user facing. The change makes the type annotation more general, and should not be a breaking change in any sense.\r\n\r\nThe previous type annotation behaves like so:\r\n```python\r\n# Will not produce type errors:\r\nRow(\"Alice\", \"Bob\")\r\n# Will produce type errors:\r\nRow(\"Alice\", 11)\r\n```\r\nAfter this change, both lines will be accepted by a type checker.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] MyPy tests of PySpark source code\r\n    ```\r\n    mypy --no-incremental --config python/mypy.ini python/pyspark\r\n    ```\r\n    For me, this currently fails on `master` with the following errors:\r\n    ```\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/tree.pyi:29: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/tree.pyi:38: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:34: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:42: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:48: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:54: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:76: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:124: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/feature.pyi:165: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/clustering.pyi:45: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/clustering.pyi:72: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/classification.pyi:39: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    python/pyspark/mllib/classification.pyi:52: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types\r\n    Found 13 errors in 4 files (checked 314 source files)\r\n    ```\r\n    Re-running after my change doesn't introduce any new errors.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreserve the insertion order of columns in Dataset.withColumns\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is the expected behavior. We preserve insertion order in all other places.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Currently Dataset.withColumns is not actually used anywhere to insert more than one column. This change is to make sure it behaves as expected when it is used for that purpose in future.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces a helper class that simplifies usage of `Dataset.observe()` for batch datasets:\r\n\r\n    val observation = Observation(\"name\")\r\n    val observed = ds.observe(observation, max($\"id\").as(\"max_id\"))\r\n    observed.count()\r\n    val metrics = observation.get\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, users are required to implement the `QueryExecutionListener` interface to retrieve the metrics, as well as apply some knowledge on threading and locking to pull the metrics over to the main thread. With the helper class, metrics can be retrieved from batch dataset processing with three lines of code (the action on the observed dataset does not count as a line of code here).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, one new class and one `Dataset`` method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdds a unit test to `DataFrameSuite`, similar to `\"get observable metrics by callback\"` in `DataFrameCallbackSuite`.","created_at":"2021-07-19T15:09:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T08:12:51Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T08:57:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8199ccfb93e7c46c3dc271f6ea7a9aa344755217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b2d9ae8800b639e91cc53a44d662c7f72e0157b","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-observation","ref":"branch-observation","sha":"3b2d9ae8800b639e91cc53a44d662c7f72e0157b","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisables the daily build and test job introduced in #33358 for fork repos.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith #33358 there is a daily build and test job that runs on **all** forks of Spark. This is of little use for fork repos but it will eventually become active on thousands of Spark fork repos and run there every day. Lets save Github some computation resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTrivial change, same solution as in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `DataFrame.to_csv` has `mode` arguments both in pandas and pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nHowever, pandas allows the string \"w\", \"w+\", \"a\", \"a+\" where as pandas-on-Spark allows \"append\", \"overwrite\", \"ignore\", \"error\" or \"errorifexists\".\r\n\r\nWe should map them while `mode` can still accept the existing

TimestampNTZ type from/to Avro's Local timestamp type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDocking TimestampNTZ type in Spark and Local timestamp in Avro.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nSpark will read/write the TimestampNTZ/Local timestamp in Avro.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-19T06:09:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T06:31:57Z","closed_at":"2021-07-29T12:35:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5c808197fd73300e51f8d658e147b1c0b8d8031","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e18b8b2b56b8f1b2ac83c0a9a8ebf3d42d37ffde","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-36175","ref":"SPARK-36175","sha":"e18b8b2b56b8f1b2ac83c0a9a8ebf3d42d37ffde","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a simple followup from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33376:\r\n- It simplifies a bit by removing the default Scala version in the testing script (so we don't have to change here in the future when we change the Scala default version).\r\n- Call `change-scala-version.sh` script (when `SCALA_PROFILE` is explicitly specified)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMore refactoring. In addition, this change will be used at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33410\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nScala 2.13 daily job was added but ideally we should deduplicate it. This PR targets to deduplicate it by creating one more job (`configure-jobs`) that the main job depends on.\r\n\r\n`configure-jobs` will properly set the branch, envs, etc. to run the main build properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the maintenance easier \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to set `MaxMetaspaceSize` to `2g` because it's increasing the native memory consumption unlimitedly by default. The unlimited increasing memory causes GitHub Action flakiness. The value I observed during `hive` module test was over 1.8G and growing.\r\n\r\n- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/gctuning/other-considerations.htm#JSGCT-GUID-BFB89453-60C0-42AC-81CA-87D59B0ACE2E\r\n> Starting with JDK 8, the permanent generation was removed and the class metadata is allocated in native memory. The amount of native memory that can be used for class metadata is by default unlimited. Use the option -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize to put an upper limit on the amount of native memory used for class metadata.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I increased the following memory limit to 4g consistently from two places.\r\n```xml\r\n- <jvmArg>-Xms2048m</jvmArg>\r\n- <jvmArg>-Xmx2048m</jvmArg>\r\n+ <jvmArg>-Xms4g</jvmArg>\r\n+ <jvmArg>-Xmx4g</jvmArg>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n- javaOptions += \"-Xmx3g\",\r\n+ javaOptions ++= \"-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2g\".split(\" \").toSeq,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will reduce the flakiness in CI environment by limiting the memory usage explicitly.\r\n\r\nWhen we limit it with `1g`, Hive module fails with `OOM` like the following.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace\r\nError: Exception in thread \"dispatcher-event-loop-110\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. This pr add a new logical plan visitor named `DistinctAttributesVisitor` to find out all the distinct attributes in current logical plan. For example:\r\n   ```scala\r\n   spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t(a int, b int, c int) using parquet\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"SELECT a, b, a % 10, a AS aliased_a, max(c), sum(b) FROM t GROUP BY a, b\").queryExecution.analyzed.distinctKeys\r\n   ```\r\n   The output is: {a#1, b#2}, {b#2, aliased_a#0}.\r\n\r\n2. Enhance `RemoveRedundantAggregates` to remove the aggregation from left semi/anti join if the same aggregation has already been done on left side. For example:\r\n   ```sql\r\n   set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1; -- avoid PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin\r\n   create table t1 using parquet as select id a, id as b from range(10);\r\n   create table t2 using parquet as select id as a, id as b from range(8);\r\n   select t11.a, t11.b from (select distinct a, b from t1) t11 left semi join t2 on (t11.a = t2.a) group by t11.a, t11.b;\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch removes an ignored test from `RocksDBSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe removed test is now ignored. The test itself doesn't look making sense. For example, the condition for capturing exception is never matched. The test runs updates to RocksDB instances at same remote dir with same versions. This doesn't look like a case it will run through in practice.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-07-16T21:30:23Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:27:16Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T09:05:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7aa3f199d899b143701c78fca3da282aa4cb9019","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, two AQE rules `OptimizeLocalShuffleReader` and `OptimizeSkewedJoin` run `EnsureRequirements` at the end to check if there are extra shuffles in the optimized plan and revert the optimization if extra shuffles are introduced.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to run `ValidateRequirements` instead, which is much simpler than `EnsureRequirements`. This PR also moves this check to `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`, so that it's centralized instead of in each rule. After centralization, the batch name of optimizing the final stage is the same as normal stages, which makes more sense.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`EnsureRequirements` is a big rule and even contains optimizations (remove unnecessary shuffles). `ValidateRequirements` is much faster to run and can avoid potential bugs as it has no optimization and is a pure check.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip the CRAN check in old branches (than the latest version uploaded to CRAN)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCRAN check in branch-3.0 fails as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInsufficient package version (submitted: 3.0.4, existing: 3.1.2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because CRAN doesn't allow lower version then the latest version. We can't upload so should better just skip the CRAN check.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate either the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` or/and Parquet option `datetimeRebaseMode` to `ParquetFilters`. The `ParquetFilters` class uses the settings in conversions of dates/timestamps instances from datasource filters to values pushed via `FilterApi` to the `parquet-column` lib.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, date/timestamp values expressed as days/microseconds/milliseconds are interpreted as offsets in Proleptic Gregorian calendar, and pushed to the parquet library as is. That works fine if timestamp/dates values in parquet files were saved in the `CORRECTED` mode but in the `LEGACY` mode, filter's values could not match to actual values.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, timestamp/dates values of filters pushed down to parquet libs such as `FilterApi.eq(col1, -719162)` are rebased according the rebase settings. For the example, if the rebase mode is `CORRECTED`, **-719162** is pushed down as is but if the current rebase mode is `LEGACY`, the number of days is rebased to **-719164**. For more context, the PR description https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28067 shows the diffs between two calendars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug portrayed by the following example from SPARK-36034:\r\n```scala\r\nIn [27]: spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\n>>> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date = '0001-01-01'\").show()\r\n+----+\r\n|date|\r\n+----+\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\nThe result must have the date value `0001-01-01`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. Query results can be different in some cases. For the example above:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date = '0001-01-01'\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|0001-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new grammar `EXPLAIN FINAL XXX` to explain final plan in AQE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe executed plan will be changed during running in AQE, however the current implementation of explain does not support this.\r\n\r\nAs the AQE is enabled by default, user may want to get the final plan using query, so it should make sense to add a new grammar to support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, new grammar.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

stage-level resource scheduling, the allocated 3rd party resources can be obtained in TaskContext using resources() interface, however there is no API to get how many cpus are allocated for the task. Will add a cpus() interface to TaskContext to complement resources(). Althrough the task cpu requests can be got from profile, it's more convenient to get it inside the task code without the need to pass profile from driver side to the executor side. \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd cpus() interface in TaskContext and modify relevant code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTaskContext has resources() to get 3rd party resources allocated. the is no API to get CPU allocated for the task.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd cpus() interface for TaskContext\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChange `HiveShim.getPartitionsByFilter` to always fallback to use `getAllPartitionsMethod` even if `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` is set to true in the remote HMS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment `getPartitionsByFilter` in `HiveShim` only fallback to use `getAllPartitionsMethod` when `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` is disabled in the remote HMS, and will fail the query otherwise. However, in certain cases the remote HMS will fallback to use ORM (which only support string type for partition columns) to query the underlying RDBMS **even if this config is set to true**. In this scenario, currently Spark will not be able to recover from the exception and will just fail the query.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we encountered this bug [HIVE-21497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-21497) in HMS running Hive 3.1.2, and Spark was not able to pushdown filter for date column.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now if Spark is querying partitions from a remote HMS which throws exception even if `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` is set to true, Spark will fallback to list all partitions and do the pruning on client side, instead of failing the query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested locally with a HMS instance running 3.1.2. It's pretty hard to add a unit test for this since we don't have a mock HMS.","created_at":"2021-07-16T02:28:55Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T00:31:23Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T23:49:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"857c1dc9600a894b9459b2f2b59433d23a128219","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32fc0054a6f71565f9e44d3a542310392ab3bd77","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-36137-direct-sql","ref":"SPARK-36137-direct-sql","sha":"32fc0054a6f71565f9e44d3a542310392ab3bd77","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe tnit-to-unit interval literals and the unit list interval literals are converted to ANSI interval types but quoted interval literals are still converted to CalendarIntervalType.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- Unit list interval literals\r\nspark-sql> select interval 1 year 2 month;\r\n1-2\r\n-- Quoted interval literals\r\nspark-sql> select interval '1 year 2 month';\r\n1 years 2 months\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but the following sentence in `sql-migration-guide.md` seems to cover this change.\r\n```\r\n  - In Spark 3.2, the unit list interval literals can not mix year-month fields (YEAR and MONTH) and day-time fields (WEEK, DAY, ..., MICROSECOND). \r\nFor example, `INTERVAL 1 day 1 hour` is invalid in Spark 3.2. In Spark 3.1 and earlier,\r\nthere is no such limitation and the literal returns value of `CalendarIntervalType`.\r\nTo restore the behavior before Spark 3.2, you can set `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled` to `true`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified existing tests and add new tests.","created_at":"2021-07-16T02:00:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T09:23:47Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T09:23:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccb650c746b324390d1322fbcc75bc80c6d7e168","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68a372b5eec11b1f329f7fb66d5e93884a4d55f5","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-interval-constructor","ref":"fix-interval-constructor","sha":"68a372b5eec11b1f329f7fb66d5e93884a4d55f5","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `broadcast` functions in `pyspark.pandas` is duplicated to `DataFrame.spark.hint` with `\"broadcast\"`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# The below 2 lines are the same\r\ndf.spark.hint(\"broadcast\")\r\nps.broadcast(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, we should remove `broadcast` in the future, and show deprecation warning for now.\r\n\r\nAnd the `num_files` argument doesn't actually manage the number of files, but specifying the partition number.\r\n\r\nSo, we should deprecate the `num_files` argument and encourage users to use `DataFrame.spark.repartition` API instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor deduplication of functions and arguments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThey see the deprecation warning when using `broadcast` in `pyspark.pandas`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.broadcast(df)\r\nFutureWarning: `broadcast` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. use `DataFrame.spark.hint` with 'broadcast' for `name` parameter instead.\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso see the deprecation warning when using `num_files`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBelow 2 bugs were introduced with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32140\r\n1. Instead of requesting the local-dirs for push-merged-local blocks from the ESS, `PushBasedFetchHelper` requests it from other executors. Push-based shuffle is only enabled when the ESS is enabled so it should always fetch the dirs from the ESS and not from other executors which is not yet supported.\r\n2. The size of the push-merged blocks is logged incorrectly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the above mentioned bugs and is needed for push-based shuffle to work properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested this by running an application on the cluster. The UTs mock the call `hostLocalDirManager.getHostLocalDirs` which is why didn't catch (1) with the UT. However, the fix is trivial and checking this in the UT will require a lot more effort so I haven't modified it in the UT.\r\nLogs of the executor with the bug\r\n```\r\n21/07/15 15:42:46 WARN ExternalBlockStoreClient: Error while trying to get the host local dirs for [shuffle-push-merger]\r\n21/07/15 15:42:46 WARN PushBasedFetchHelper: Error while fetching the merged dirs for push-merged-local blocks: shuffle_0_-1_13.

blocks.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-15T23:11:48Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T05:29:20Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T05:27:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4de3c97efe3e71b9d7a83ef2d8c2f08e60b0ff09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b7ae49bc6e3c229951c8ec2e9e114e82fd8161da","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-32922-followup","ref":"SPARK-32922-followup","sha":"b7ae49bc6e3c229951c8ec2e9e114e82fd8161da","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor Apache Spark 3.2, this PR aims to support Scala 2.13 test in `dev/run-tests.py` by adding `SCALA_PROFILE` and in `dev/run-tests-jenkins.py` by adding `AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_SCALA_PROFILE`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `test-dependencies.sh` is skipped for Scala 2.13 because we currently don't maintain the dependency manifests yet. This will be handled after Apache Spark 3.2.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo test Scala 2.13 with `dev/run-tests.py`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual. The following is the result. Note that this PR aims to **run** Scala 2.13 tests instead of **passing** them. We will have daily GitHub Action job via #33358 and will fix UT failures if exists.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n\r\n$ SCALA_PROFILE=scala2.13

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate either the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` or/and Parquet option `datetimeRebaseMode` to `ParquetFilters`. The `ParquetFilters` class uses the settings in conversions of dates/timestamps instances from datasource filters to values pushed via `FilterApi` to the `parquet-column` lib.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, date/timestamp values expressed as days/microseconds/milliseconds are interpreted as offsets in Proleptic Gregorian calendar, and pushed to the parquet library as is. That works fine if timestamp/dates values in parquet files were saved in the `CORRECTED` mode but in the `LEGACY` mode, filter's values could not match to actual values.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, timestamp/dates values of filters pushed down to parquet libs such as `FilterApi.eq(col1, -719162)` are rebased according the rebase settings. For the example, if the rebase mode is `CORRECTED`, **-719162** is pushed down as is but if the current rebase mode is `LEGACY`, the number of days is rebased to **-719164**. For more context, the PR description https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28067 shows the diffs between two calendars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug portrayed by the following example from SPARK-36034:\r\n```scala\r\nIn [27]: spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\n>>> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date = '0001-01-01'\").show()\r\n+----+\r\n|date|\r\n+----+\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\nThe result must have the date value `0001-01-01`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. Query results can be different in some cases. For the example above:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date = '0001-01-01'\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|0001-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite `ParquetFilterSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetV1FilterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetV2FilterSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport comparison between a Categorical and a scalar.\r\nThere are 3 main changes:\r\n- Modify `==` and `!=` from comparing **codes** of the Categorical to the scalar to comparing **actual values** of the Categorical to the scalar.\r\n- Support `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` between a Categorical and a scalar.\r\n- TypeError message fix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\npandas supports comparison between a Categorical and a scalar, we should follow pandas' behaviors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype\r\n>>> pser = pd.Series(pd.Categorical([1, 2,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two issues highlighted in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36163:\r\n- JDBC connection provider propagates incorrect connection properties.\r\n- Ambiguity when more than one JDBC connection provider is available.\r\n\r\nI updated `BasicConnectionProvider` to use `jdbcOptions.asConnectionProperties` to remove JDBC data source specific options.\r\n\r\nI also added `connectionProvider` data source option that specifies the name of the provider, e.g. `db2`, `presto`, to allow enforcing this specific provider in case of ambiguity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers can leverage `spark.sql.sources.disabledJdbcConnProviderList` but it is cumbersome and requires them to disable all other providers which could be problematic when using ambiguous providers in two or more different JDBC queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\nPROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\r\nThis introduces new JDBC data source option `connectionProvider` that allows users to select a specific JDBC connection provider based on the short name. I updated the SQL guide doc and README.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the only way to resolve ambiguity was SQL conf to blacklist all of the other JDBC connection providers. After this change users will be able to specify the exact connection provider they need per data source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI updated the existing `ConnectionProviderSuite` and added a new `BasicConnectionProviderSuite`.","created_at":"2021-07-15T14:48:40Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T08:50:50Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T08:48:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"883ab34ebde5e968013c994ce9d10400cde55fcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e94cf0cc507fe31f26651587a257a36db16763fc","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-jdbc-conn-provider","ref":"fix-jdbc-conn-provider","sha":"e94cf0cc507fe31f26651587a257a36db16763fc","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the application of the operators for TimeWindow, from project -> filter, to filter -> project.\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark applies project, and filter, while filter is not dependent on project. That said, if the input rows are going to be filtered out via filter predicate, applying projection on these input rows are simply waste of time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a simple improvement requiring changes from a couple of lines.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the error message for wrong type when calling dropDuplicates in pyspark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current error message is cryptic and can be unclear to less experienced users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds a type error for when a user gives the wrong type to dropDuplicates\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere is currently no testing for error messages in pyspark dataframe

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemoves outer join if it only references the streamed side and the uniqueness can be guaranteed on the buffered side.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table t1(id int, name varchar(255)) using parquet;\r\ncreate table t2(id int, name varchar(255)) using parquet;\r\nselect t1.name from t1 left join (select distinct id from t2) t21 on t1.id = t21.id;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [name#1]\r\n+- Join LeftOuter, (id#0 = id#2)\r\n   :- Relation default.t1[id#0,name#1] parquet\r\n   +- Aggregate [id#2], [id#2]\r\n      +- Project [id#2]\r\n         +- Filter isnotnull(id#2)\r\n            +- Relation default.t2[id#2,name#3] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove both `PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite` and `PrunePartitionSuiteBase` to the package `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources`. Did a few refactoring to enable this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently both `PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite` and `PrunePartitionSuiteBase` are in package `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution` which doesn't look correct as these tests are not specific to Hive. Therefore, it's better to move them into `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources`, the same place where the rule `PruneFileSourcePartitions` is at.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's just test refactoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsing existing tests:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/testOnly *PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"hive/testOnly *PruneHiveTablePartitionsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-07-15T00:26:05Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T16:38:20Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T20:04:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"914d5ae3f100dcd3a1eaff9820db6d57306e9788","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6fa7a504944212337150147be86540730ff4346","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-36136-partitions-suite","ref":"SPARK-36136-partitions-suite","sha":"d6fa7a504944212337150147be86540730ff4346","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `CatalogFileIndex.filterPartitions`, check the config `spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruning` and don't pushdown predicates to remote HMS if it is false. Instead, fallback to the `listPartitions` API and do the filtering on the client side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the config `spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruning` is only effective for Hive tables, and for non-Hive tables we'd always use the `listPartitionsByFilter` API from HMS client. On the other hand, by default all data source tables also manage their partitions through HMS, when the config `spark.sql.hive.manageFilesourcePartitions` is turned on. Therefore, it seems reasonable to extend the above config for non-Hive tables as well.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the remote HMS service could throw exceptions when using the `listPartitionsByFilter` API, which, on the Spark side, is unrecoverable at the current state. Therefore it would be better to allow users to disable the API by using the above config. \r\n\r\nFor instance, HMS only allow pushdown date column when direct SQL is used instead of JDO for interacting with the underlying RDBMS, and will throw exception otherwise. Even though the Spark Hive client will attempt to recover itself when the exception happens, it only does so when the config `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` from remote HMS is `false`. There could be cases where the value of `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` is true but remote HMS still throws exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes now the config `spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruning` is extended for non-Hive tables which use HMS to manage their partition metadata.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate either the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` or/and Parquet option `datetimeRebaseMode` to `ParquetFilters`. The `ParquetFilters` class uses the settings in conversions of dates/timestamps instances from datasource filters to values pushed via `FilterApi` to the `parquet-column` lib.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, date/timestamp values expressed as days/microseconds/milliseconds are interpreted as offsets in Proleptic Gregorian calendar, and pushed to the parquet library as is. That works fine if timestamp/dates values in parquet files were saved in the `CORRECTED` mode but in the `LEGACY` mode, filter's values could not match to actual values.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, timestamp/dates values of filters pushed down to parquet libs such as `FilterApi.eq(col1, -719162)` are rebased according the rebase settings. For the example, if the rebase mode is `CORRECTED`, **-719162** is pushed down as is but if the current rebase mode is `LEGACY`, the number of days is rebased to **-719164**. For more context, the PR description https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28067 shows the diffs between two calendars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug portrayed by the following example from SPARK-36034:\r\n```scala\r\nIn [27]: spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\n>>> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date = '0001-01-01'\").show()\r\n+----+\r\n|date|\r\n+----+\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\nThe result must have the date value `0001-01-01`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. Query results can be different in some cases. For the example above:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"LEGACY\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT DATE '0001-01-01' AS date\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\")\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"date_written_by_spark3_legacy\").where(\"date =
