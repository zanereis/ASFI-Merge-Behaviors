a visualization: Spider/Radar chart (using D3) \r\n\r\nIt has options to 'group by' selected columns, and compare the categories on a single metric for all of those columns. The comparisons are shown on the axis of the graph, each axis represents a category. \r\n\r\nThere is also functionality to set the max value of the graph (outermost circle), this 'stretches' the axes on which the metric's values are plotted. \r\n\r\nI have not added any tests, as I am unsure of what I need to test, and how I need to do this - more than happy to add, just need some help there.

PR does some major refactoring of the current Dashboard builder branch to significantly improve react/redux performance and completely delete the v1 `GridCell` + `GridLayout` üéâ . \r\n\r\n**Stats** for the Births default dashboard\r\nThe improved render numbers are at their optimum given the data that updates.\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/39079980-50069bfa-44da-11e8-8220-addeca7d0ce0.png\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n**Perf architecture details**\r\nPreviously, actual instances of `GridCell` components were passed from the top-level `<Dashboard />` component through the `<DashboardComponent />` tree as props. These were _all_ updated whenever a component changed query status or a chart was resized, causing massive render cascades.\r\n\r\nTo minimize component updates, it's better to connect leaf `<Chart />` nodes to redux, so state changes for a given chart only affect that component cause. \r\n\r\nThis PR also \r\n- adds support for a custom `react-dnd` drag layer preview which is used in the new component side pane because the standard browser preview doesn't seem to work with a fixed layout (ie `react-virtualized`).\r\n- adds stricter rules to the Dashboard app with a new `.eslintrc`; we can move these to the rest of Superset in the future.\r\n- adds prettier to the dashboard app, which auto-fixes eslint rules when possible on save (you need to configure your code editor to do this); we can add this to the rest of Superset in the future.\r\n- merges the `dashboard/v2/` folder into `dashboard/`\r\n- moves connected `component/*Container` components => into proper `containers/*` folder\r\n\r\n**TODO before merge**\r\n- [x] add support for custom drag layer\r\n- [x] add prettier + fix linting errors from stricter rules\r\n- [x] remove unused libraries + files\r\n- [x] clean up directory structure (merge `v2/` into `dashboard/`)\r\n- [ ] [maybe] fix tests, may do this in another PR\r\n\r\n@graceguo-supercat please üëÄ and feel free to pull this to play with the perf yourself

Pandas [read_sql](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.22.0/pandas/io/sql.py#L335-L416) method either reads a SQL query _or_ a database table (we require only the former) into a DataFrame. This results in an additional query (for non-SQLite databases) to determine whether the `sql` object represents a SQL query or table name. This is unnecessary as the `sql` object is always a SQL statement when called from `get_df`. \r\n\r\nThis PR uses the [read_sql_query](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.22.0/pandas/io/sql.py#L273-L332) method instead which merely reads the SQL query into a DataFrame thus saving us executing an unnecessary statement. \r\n\r\nNote for context about 15% of all our Presto queries originating from PyHive represented the now obsolete query.","created_at":"2018-04-20T00:47:41Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T17:01:44Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T21:36:21Z","merged_at":"2018-04-20T21:36:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"89347172d22688d110e24df3cfc35efe77dce45c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

number of y-axis ticks (to ~5), there is no need for ~10+ that nvd3 sets by default\r\n- rich tooltip => false by default, this makes tooltips look pretty bad, you can still hover over individual lines to see their values, or toggle on rich tooltips if you want them.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @hughhhh @john-bodley @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @fabianmenges

are a few cases where we are using d3.html() which intentionally doesn't escape html. In these cases if a user has data with html tags we are not escaping it so some js can be executed. For example if a group by column in a table has an html tag with an onerror, the onerror will get executed in the browser when the table renders.\r\n\r\nInitially I tried to do this in some central place so that we didn't have to go into individual files in /visualizations but when looking into it more, it seems to happen when we are using d3.html(). Let me know if there's a better way to do this. I may have missed a few cases, mainly trying to quickly get a fix out for the most used visualizations.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @graceguo-supercat

[0.21.0](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/0.21.0/) Pandas has dropped support for Python 3.4 which is now causing problems with Travis CI. I speculate the issue is only now surfacing with the release of `pip` version `10.0` per [this](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/20697) thread. \r\n\r\nIt seems other applications are dropping support for Python 3.4 and I was wondering whether we should do the same (and adding Python 3.6 as a replacement) as opposed to having to write specific logic to handle different Pandas versions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updated the Travis CI matrix to include both Python 2.7 and 3.6 which ensures that the `nosetests` run in the Python version specified by Travis, and that both `flake8` and `pylint` run for all Python versions (previously these ran only for Python 2.7).\r\n\r\nto: @fabianmenges @mistercrunch \r\ncc: @timifasubaa

PR enables sqllab to load queries early after the first 100 rows are available. Since this uses fetchmany, it should be possible for all our dbs but this PR implements it for just Presto.  \r\n\r\nThis has the benefit of makingusers wait less before seeing questy results and also enabling them iterate on their query quicker and also visualize much earlier on in the process. \r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30888507/38958237-8b95026c-4311-11e8-9ed0-8eca6b4bbe70.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses #4588 \r\n\r\nAt a high level, the celery worker loads the first 100 results into an s3 bicket and loads it.

PR standardizes the configuration logic following the [suggestions](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/config/#configuring-from-files) defined in the Flask documentation.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Uses the recommended Flask approach.\r\n- Reduces the number of configuration options and environment variables from three (`PYTHONPATH`, `SUPERSET_CONFIG`, `SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH`) to one (`SUPERSET_CONFIG_FILE`). Note I renamed `SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH` to `SUPERSET_CONFIG_FILE` as it is more intuitive that it refers to a file as opposed to either a directory or file path.\r\n- Raises an error for ill-defined config files (which is handled by Flask). Note previously neither of the `PYTHONPATH` or `SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH` approaches would raise an error if the config file was ill-formed which meant it wasn't apparent what state the configuration was in. We've been caught out by this issue a few times in the past.\r\n- Reduces the code footprint.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Breaking change. The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable needs to be replaced with the `SUPERSET_CONFIG_FILE`.\r\n\r\nto: @fabianmenges

PR adds a new viz type, `line_multi`. It's similar to the Deck.gl multi, in that it combines different saved charts (of lines) into a single chart.

PR adds several improvements to the dashboard builder\r\n\r\n**redux state**\r\n  - changed layout key from `dashboard` => `dashboardLayout` for clarity\r\n  - added `editMode` state + actions/reducers\r\n  - added `messageToasts` state + actions/reducers\r\n\r\n**UX improvements**\r\n- added `<ToastPresenter />` + `<Toast />` components for general messaging\r\n  <img

toast\r\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/38339612-f7ec2128-3823-11e8-87d5-e93bbf5bbc8f.gif\" width=\"500\" />\r\n- several tweaks to improve drag and drop UX\r\n\r\n**UI improvements**\r\n- propagated `editMode` prop to all `DashboardComponent`s so that they render in both editable + static mode (for when the dashboard is in view mode)\r\n- removed `Spacer` component as it added too much complexity\r\n- added improved transparent indicator\r\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4496521/38339528-83778792-3823-11e8-8fee-25207ed9a698.png\" width=\"300\" />\r\n- resizable container + header style fixes to ensure that headers are always multiples of the grid base unit \r\n\r\n**Cleanup / bug fix**\r\n- removed grid gutter components, instead added margins between row and column contents\r\n- fixed a bug with resizable containers that resulted in compressed component width when too many elements were in a row\r\n\r\n@graceguo-supercat @elibrumbaugh\r\ncc @hughhhh @mistercrunch

feature allows users to ‚Äúpublish‚Äù dashboards which essentially adds a notion of dashboards being public or private. The goal of this is to reduce the clutter that comes from a whole organization creating dashboards, many of which are not relevant to other users (or only a subset, whom they can share with selectively). The changes affect the following contexts:\r\n\r\nOn creating a dashboard:\r\n\t- Add a boolean published column to the dashboard model and allow the owners of a given dashboard to toggle this field in the UI.\r\n\r\nOn listing dashboards:\r\n\t- Don‚Äôt show all dashboards but instead only list dashboards with the following properties\r\n\t\t1. Dashboards the current user owns\r\n\t\t2. Dashboards that have been published (by any user)\r\n\t\t3. Dashboards which the user has favorited\r\n\r\nRegarding point (3) above ‚Äì The idea here was that no dashboard is strictly ‚Äúprivate‚Äù in that it cannot be viewed if it is not published. This means that if a user creates an unpublished dashboard, they should still be able to send the link to others to share it with them. However, since the dashboard is unpublished the visitor wouldn‚Äôt see it in the list so they would need to keep the link around which isn‚Äôt a very friendly user experience. So to get around this we allow the user to favorite the dashboard and then it will show up in their list of dashboards.\r\n\r\nissues which might be relevant to this: #1799 #2792 #4002\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Add the 'published' column to the dashboard model and generate alembic migration file\r\n- [x] Don't show unpublished dashboards on listing all dashboards.\r\n- [x] Expose endpoint for toggling published status.\r\n- [x] Protect published endpoint by allowing only owners to change the status.\r\n- [x] Create React component on dashboards to represent and toggle status. \r\n- [x] Show error in the UI if somebody tries to toggle published on a dashboard which they don't own\r\n- [x] Show Users favorited dashboards in the dashboard list even if they're not published\r\n- [x] Write unit tests for dashboard visibility\r\n- [x] Show interactions with the feature in this

DBAPI isn't super clear and homogeneous on the\r\ncursor.description specification, and this PR attempts to improve\r\ninferring the datatypes returned in the cursor.\r\n\r\nThis work started around Presto's TIMESTAMP type being mishandled as\r\nstring as the database driver (pyhive) returns it as a string. The work\r\nhere fixes this bug and does a better job at inferring MySQL and Presto types.\r\nIt also creates a new method in db_engine_specs allowing for other\r\ndatabases engines to implement and become more precise on type-inference\r\nas needed.\r\n\r\nNote that the role of `SupersetDataFrame` isn't super clear here. I think the original intent was to derive pandas.DataFrame but this isn't allowed by the pandas lib. So it became more of a wrapper around `pandas.DataFrame`.\r\n\r\nNow its role becomes even less clear here after the PR.\r\n\r\nThe longer term vision is probably to make this class a pandas DataFrame-related utility wrapper, meaning it would know how to get a dataframe give a query & cursor and will be able to do things like type-inference or other operation that are dataframe related.","created_at":"2018-03-30T20:53:57Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T17:00:48Z","closed_at":"2018-06-28T04:35:13Z","merged_at":"2018-06-28T04:35:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"777d876a523590be0e18f573eab02137fa989fa3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è
