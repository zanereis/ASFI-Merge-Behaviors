What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen there is an operation between Decimals and the result is a number which is not representable exactly with the result's precision and scale, Spark is returning `NULL`. This was done to reflect Hive's behavior, but it is against SQL ANSI 2011, which states that \"If the result cannot be represented exactly in the result type, then whether it is rounded or truncated is implementation-defined\". Moreover, Hive now changed its behavior in order to respect the standard, thanks to HIVE-15331.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the PR propose to:\r\n - update the rules to determine the result precision and scale according to the new Hive's ones introduces in HIVE-15331;\r\n - round the result of the operations, when it is not representable exactly with the result's precision and scale, instead of returning `NULL`\r\n - introduce a new config `spark.sql.decimalOperations.allowPrecisionLoss` which default to `true` (ie. the new behavior) in order to allow users to switch back to the previous one.\r\n\r\nHive behavior reflects SQLServer's one. The only difference is that the precision and scale are adjusted for all the arithmetic operations in Hive, while SQL Server is said to do so only for multiplications and divisions in the documentation. This PR follows Hive's behavior.\r\n\r\nA more detailed explanation is available here: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/spark-dev/201712.mbox/%3CCAEorWNAJ4TxJR9NBcgSFMD_VxTg8qVxusjP%2BAJP-x%2BJV9zH-yA%40mail.gmail.com%3E.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmodified and added UTs. Comparisons with results of Hive and SQLServer.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-19T16:41:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T13:28:08Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T13:28:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31854e7654f91998f2e89d0535201d7bbbade99b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b4b0350dea09db897b70485ef1fad41a742eae30","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-22036","ref":"SPARK-22036","sha":"b4b0350dea09db897b70485ef1fad41a742eae30","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPassing global variables to the split method is dangerous, as any mutating to it is ignored and may lead to unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, one approach is to make sure no expression would output global variables: Localizing lifetime of mutable states in expressions.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is, when calling `ctx.splitExpression`, make sure we don't use children's output as parameter names.\r\n\r\nApproach 1 is actually hard to do, as we need to check all expressions and operators that support whole-stage codegen. Approach 2 is easier as the callers of `ctx.splitExpressions` are not too many.\r\n\r\nBesides, approach 2 is more flexible, as children's output may be other stuff that can't be parameter name: literal, inlined statement(a + 1), etc.\r\n\r\nclose https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19865\r\nclose https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19938\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the task memory manager throws an OutofMemory error when there is an IO exception happens in spill() - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/memory/TaskMemoryManager.java#L194. Similarly there any many other places in code when if a task is not able to acquire memory due to an exception we throw an OutofMemory error which kills the entire executor and hence failing all the tasks that are running on that executor instead of just failing one single task.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

are two main changes to speed up rendering of the tasks list\r\nwhen rendering the stage page.\r\n\r\nThe first one makes the code only load the tasks being shown in the\r\ncurrent page of the tasks table, and information related to only\r\nthose tasks. One side-effect of this change is that the graph that\r\nshows task-related events now only shows events for the tasks in\r\nthe current page, instead of the previously hardcoded limit of \"events\r\nfor the first 1000 tasks\". That ends up helping with readability,\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nTo make sorting efficient when using a disk store, the task wrapper\r\nwas extended to include many new indices, one for each of the sortable\r\ncolumns in the UI, and metrics for which quantiles are calculated.\r\n\r\nThe second changes the way metric quantiles are calculated for stages.\r\nInstead of using the \"Distribution\" class to process data for all task\r\nmetrics, which requires scanning all tasks of a stage, the code now\r\nuses the KVStore \"skip()\" functionality to only read tasks that contain\r\ninteresting information for the quantiles that are desired.\r\n\r\nThis is still not cheap; because there are many metrics that the UI\r\nand API track, the code needs to scan the index for each metric to\r\ngather the information. Savings come mainly from skipping deserialization\r\nwhen using the disk store, but the in-memory code also seems to be\r\nfaster than before (most probably because of other changes in this\r\npatch).\r\n\r\nTo make subsequent calls faster, some quantiles are cached in the\r\nstatus store. This makes UIs much faster after the first time a stage\r\nhas been loaded.\r\n\r\nWith the above changes, a lot of code in the UI layer could be simplified.","created_at":"2017-12-18T22:04:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T19:49:38Z","closed_at":"2018-01-11T11:44:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68900e93d031ca5883ef9b68cb743151d016fd88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34d02b2c05f42a7992de85b7d0c447bba738d2a8","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20657","ref":"SPARK-20657","sha":"34d02b2c05f42a7992de85b7d0c447bba738d2a8","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

change adds a new configuration option and support code that limits\r\nhow much disk space the SHS will use. The default value is pretty generous\r\nso that applications will, hopefully, only rarely need to be replayed\r\nbecause of their disk stored being evicted.\r\n\r\nThis works by keeping track of how much data each application is using.\r\nAlso, because it's not possible to know, before replaying, how much space\r\nwill be needed, it's possible that usage will exceed the configured limit\r\ntemporarily. The code uses the concept of a \"lease\" to try to limit how\r\nmuch the SHS will exceed the limit in those cases.\r\n\r\nActive UIs are also tracked, so they're never deleted. This works in\r\ntandem with the existing option of how many active UIs are loaded; because\r\nunused UIs will be unloaded, their disk stores will also become candidates\r\nfor deletion. If the data is not deleted, though, re-loading the UI is\r\npretty quick.","created_at":"2017-12-18T21:29:44Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T19:21:38Z","closed_at":"2017-12-29T16:43:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e5855f2e147fba57fd8f7d28ff3d8ec5af1ecb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/931b2d262aa02880631ca4c693a84fa4c4d12318","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20654","ref":"SPARK-20654","sha":"931b2d262aa02880631ca4c693a84fa4c4d12318","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`testthat` 2.0.0 is released and AppVeyor now started to use it instead of 1.0.2. And then, we started to have R tests failed in AppVeyor. See - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/build/1967-master\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in get(name, envir = asNamespace(pkg), inherits = FALSE) : \r\n  object 'run_tests' not found\r\nCalls: ::: -> get\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems because we rely on internal `testthat:::run_tests` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/r-lib/testthat/blob/v1.0.2/R/test-package.R#L62-L75\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dc4c351837879dab26ad8fb471dc51c06832a9e4/R/pkg/tests/run-all.R#L49-L52\r\n\r\nHowever, seems it was removed out from 2.0.0.  I tried few other exposed APIs like `test_dir` but I failed to make a good compatible fix.\r\n\r\nSeems we better fix the `testthat` version first to make the build passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn choosing a Partitioner to use for a cogroup-like operation between a number of RDDs, the default behaviour was if some of the RDDs already have a partitioner, we choose the one amongst them with the maximum number of partitions.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour, in some cases, could hit the 2G limit (SPARK-6235). To illustrate one such scenario, consider two RDDs:\r\nrDD1: with smaller data and smaller number of partitions, alongwith a Partitioner.\r\nrDD2: with much larger data and a larger number of partitions, without a Partitioner.\r\n\r\nThe cogroup of these two RDDs could hit the 2G limit, as a larger amount of data is shuffled into a smaller number of partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a safety-check wherein the Partitioner is chosen only if either of the following conditions are met:\r\n1. if the number of partitions of the RDD associated with the Partitioner is greater than or equal to the max number of upstream partitions; or \r\n2. if the number of partitions of the RDD associated with the Partitioner is less than and within a single order of magnitude of the max number of upstream partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests in PartitioningSuite and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [the environment where `/usr/sbin/lsof` does not exist](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19695#issuecomment-342865001),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe format of event logs uses a redundant representation for storage\r\nlevels, for instance, StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY is represented as\r\n\r\n    {\"Use Disk\":true,\"Use Memory\":false,\"Deserialized\":false,\"Replication\":1}\r\n\r\nwhich is 64 bytes more. This commit changes the event log representation\r\nof the StorageLevel to predefined constants: NONE, DISK_ONLY, etc. The\r\nchange is fully backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

`FeatureHasher` always treats numeric type columns as numbers and never as categorical features. It is quite common to have categorical features represented as numbers or codes in data sources.\r\n\r\nIn order to hash these features as categorical, users must first explicitly convert them to strings which is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nAdd a new param `categoricalCols` which specifies the numeric columns that should be treated as categorical features.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19681 we introduced a new interface called `AppStatusPlugin`, to register listeners and set up the UI for both live and history UI.\r\n\r\nHowever I think it's an overkill for live UI. For example, we should not register `SQLListener` if users are not using SQL functions. Previously we register the `SQLListener` and set up SQL tab when `SparkSession` is firstly created, which indicates users are going to use SQL functions. But in #19681 , we register the SQL functions during `SparkContext` creation. The same thing should apply to streaming too.\r\n\r\nI think we should keep the previous behavior, and only use this new interface for history server.\r\n\r\nTo reflect this change, I also rename the new interface to `SparkHistoryUIPlugin`\r\n\r\nThis PR also refines the tests for sql listener.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike `Parquet`, users can use `ORC` with Apache Spark structured streaming. This PR adds `orc()` to `DataStreamReader`(Scala/Python) in order to support creating streaming dataset with ORC file format more easily like the other file formats. Also, this adds a test coverage for ORC data source and updates the document.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.readStream.schema(\"a int\").orc(\"/tmp/orc_ss\").writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\r\n<console>:24: error: value orc is not a member of org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.DataStreamReader\r\n       spark.readStream.schema(\"a int\").orc(\"/tmp/orc_ss\").writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.readStream.schema(\"a int\").orc(\"/tmp/orc_ss\").writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQuery =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR added the missing service metadata for `KubernetesClusterManager`. Without the metadata, the service loader couldn't load `KubernetesClusterManager`, and caused the driver to fail to create a `ExternalClusterManager`, as being reported in SPARK-22778. The PR also changed the `k8s:` prefix used to `k8s://`, which is what existing Spark on k8s users are familiar and used to. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing verified that

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPR closed with all the comments -> https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19793\r\n\r\nIt solves the problem when submitting a wrong CreateSubmissionRequest to Spark Dispatcher was causing a bad state of Dispatcher and making it inactive as a Mesos framework.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22574\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll spark test passed successfully.\r\n\r\nIt was tested sending a wrong request (without appArgs) before and after the change. The point is easy, check if the value is null before being accessed.\r\n\r\nThis was before the change, leaving the dispatcher inactive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"Thread-22\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-22550 which fixes 64KB JVM bytecode limit problem with elt, `buildCodeBlocks` is used to split codes. However, we should use `splitExpressionsWithCurrentInputs` because it considers both normal and wholestage codgen (it is not supported yet, so it simply doesn't split the codes).\r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a multi-shuffle sorter which supports asynchronous spilling during a shuffle external sort.  The benefit is that we can insert and sort/spill in parallel, reducing the overall latency for jobs that are heavy on shuffling. The multi-shuffle sorter is added between the UnsafeShuffleWriter and ShuffleExternalSorter such that few changes are needed outside of this component, and as such, we can see clearly there is little room for regressing other code paths.\r\n\r\nThe multi-shuffle sorter is enabled via a configuration flag, spark.shuffle.async.num.sorter (default 1)  If the value is 1, then the multi-shuffle sorter is not used, it must be configured to have multiple\r\nsorters (>=2)\r\n\r\nThere is a design spec here attached to the jira.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests specifically for the MultiShuffleSorter to exercise under various spill and insert conditions.\r\nExtended the UnsafeShuffleWriterSuite to run against a single ShuffleExternalSorter or multiple via the MultiShuffleSorter to ensure no regressions.\r\nRan against production work loads and observed gains and validated based on logging.\r\nOne of the larger jobs went from ~6030 cpu-hr to ~4298 cpu-hr which was a total aggregate reduction of ~29%.  For larger jobs, this provides a great tuning option to reduce job time.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-12T22:15:21Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T02:15:05Z","closed_at":"2019-10-11T02:15:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16b789f47a4bd3edc02286ed081c2d3f07d62630","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the Kubernetes mode to be able to use remote dependencies on http/https endpoints, GCS, S3, etc. It adds steps for configuring and appending the Kubernetes init-container into the driver and executor pods for downloading remote dependencies. \r\n[Init-containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/), as the name suggests, are containers that are run to completion before the main containers start, and are often used to perform initialization tasks prior to starting the main containers. We use init-containers to localize remote application dependencies before the driver/executors start running. The code that the init-container runs is also included. This PR also adds a step to the driver and executors for mounting user-specified secrets that may store credentials for accessing data storage, e.g., S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS), into the driver and executors. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* The patch contains unit tests which are passing.\r\n* Manual testing: `./build/mvn -Pkubernetes clean package` succeeded.\r\n* Manual testing of the following cases:\r\n  * [x] Running SparkPi using container-local spark-example jar.\r\n  * [x] Running SparkPi using container-local spark-example jar with user-specific secret

#15663\r\nCurrently Spark history server will stop parsing on unknown events or unrecognized properties. We may still see part of the UI data.\r\nFor better compatibility, we can ignore unknown events and parse through the log file.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the number of executors is big, and YarnSchedulerBackend.stopped=False after YarnSchedulerBackend.stop() is running, some executor is stoped, and YarnSchedulerBackend.onDisconnected() will be called, then the problem is exists. So i change the code, when removing executor, add this executorId to executorsPendingToRemove, So the YarnSchedulerBackend.onDisconnected() will not send message to executor\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the previous PRs, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17832 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17835 , we convert `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` and `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` to `TIMESTAMP` for all the JDBC sources. However, this conversion could be risky since it does not respect our SQL configuration `spark.sql.session.timeZone`. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each vendor might have different semantics for these two types. For example, Postgres simply returns `TIMESTAMP` types for `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. For such supports, we should do it case by case. This PR reverts the general support of `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` and `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` for JDBC sources, except ORACLE Dialect.\r\n\r\nWhen supporting the ORACLE's `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`, we only support it when the JVM default timezone is the same as the user-specified configuration `spark.sql.session.timeZone` (whose default is the JVM default timezone). Now, we still treat `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` as `TIMESTAMP` when fetching the values via the Oracle JDBC connector, whose client converts the timestamp values with time zone to the timestamp values using the local JVM default timezone (a test case is added to `OracleIntegrationSuite.scala` in this PR for showing the behavior). Thus, to avoid any future behavior change, we will not support it if JVM default timezone is different from `spark.sql.session.timeZone`\r\n\r\nNo regression because the previous two PRs were just merged to be unreleased master branch. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the test cases","created_at":"2017-12-10T07:29:30Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T00:35:50Z","closed_at":"2017-12-12T00:35:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68c6b22879c1b7b2ba44f959a302327a656fd964","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cbd991f7eef04f56744de03ef47c8b3e9e24493","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:timezoneUpdate","ref":"timezoneUpdate","sha":"7cbd991f7eef04f56744de03ef47c8b3e9e24493","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR localizes lifetime of mutable states, which are used for `isNull` and `value` of aggregation results, in generated code by `HashAggregateExec`. \r\n\r\nThese status are passed to successor operations thru `consume()` method. It may violate this assumption at #19865 when operations that uses these variables are split.  In the following example, `agg_localBufValue` and `agg_localBufisNull` are passed to an successor operation (`projection`). Lifetime of mutable states `agg_bufValue` and `agg_bufIsNull` are ended at Line 120.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on @cloud-fan 's

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reduce the number of global mutable variables in generated code of `SortMergeJoin`.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, global mutable variables are used to extend lifetime of variables in the nested loop. This can be achieved by declaring variable at the outer most loop level where the variables are used.  \r\nIn the following example, `smj_value8`, `smj_value8`, and `smj_value9` are declared as local variable at lines 145-147 in `With this PR`. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes potential assertion error by #19865. Without this PR, a global mutable variable is potentially passed to arguments in generated code of split function.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR\r\n```\r\n/* 010 */   int smj_value8;\r\n/* 011 */   boolean

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to print warnings before creating local by `java.io.File`. \r\n\r\nI think we can't just simply disallow and throw an exception for such cases of `hdfs:/tmp/foo` case because it might break compatibility. Note that `hdfs:/tmp/foo` creates a directory called `hdfs:/`.\r\n\r\nThere were many discussion here about whether we should support this in other file systems or not; however, since the JIRA targets \"Spark's local dir should accept only local paths\", here I tried to resolve it by simply printing warnings. \r\n\r\nI think we could open another JIRA and design doc if this is something we should support, separately. Another note, for your information, [SPARK-1529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1529) is resolved as `Won't Fix`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=file:/a/b/c\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a local directory as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n file:/\r\n└── a\r\n    └── b\r\n        └── c\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=file:/a/b/c\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it prints a warning as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n17/12/09 21:58:49 WARN Utils: The configured local directories are not expected to be URIs; however, got suspicious values [file:/a/b/c]. Please check your configured local directories.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=file:/a/b/c,/tmp/a/b/c,hdfs:/a/b/c\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also works with comma-separated ones:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n17/12/09 22:05:01 WARN Utils: The configured local directories are not expected to be URIs; however, got suspicious values [file:/a/b/c, hdfs:/a/b/c]. Please check your configured local directories.\r\n...\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n Manually tested:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=C:\\\\a\\\\b\\\\c\r\n ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=/tmp/a/b/c\r\n ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.local.dir=a/b/c\r\n ./bin/spark-shell --conf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-20586 the flag `deterministic` was added to Scala UDF, but it is not available for python UDF. This flag is useful for cases when the UDF's code can return different result with the same input. Due to optimization, duplicate invocations may be eliminated or the function may even be invoked more times than it is present in the query. This can lead to unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the deterministic flag, via the `asNondeterministic` method, to let the user mark the function as non-deterministic and therefore avoid the optimizations which might lead to strange behaviors.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests:\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUntil 2.2.1, with the default configuration, Apache Spark returns incorrect results when ORC file schema is different from metastore schema order. This is due to Hive 1.2.1 library and some issues on `convertMetastoreOrc` option.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(1 -> 2).toDF(\"c1\", \"c2\").write.format(\"orc\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/tmp/o\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE o(c2 INT, c1 INT) STORED AS orc LOCATION '/tmp/o'\")\r\nscala> spark.table(\"o\").show    // This is wrong.\r\n+---+---+\r\n| c2| c1|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"/tmp/o\").show  // This is correct.\r\n+---+---+\r\n| c1| c2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter [SPARK-22279](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19499), the default configuration doesn't have this bug. Although Hive 1.2.1 library code path still has the problem, we had better have a test coverage on what we have now in order to prevent future regression on it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch
