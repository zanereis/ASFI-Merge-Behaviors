Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-19T06:10:50Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T06:14:38Z","closed_at":"2018-10-19T06:14:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6db6277a5aa3a81bacc3eb33b4ee1207bb02e1ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b7238372a2f65d03517693a0a99ce63e2c03cc42","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b7238372a2f65d03517693a0a99ce63e2c03cc42","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

B, B, C, C, C,     ..........]\r\n\r\nBut we want it to be:\r\n[A, B, C, B, C, C,           A, B, C, B, C, C,         A, B, C, B, C, C,     ..........]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich has been discuss before for performance: #2578 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nreimplement `RoundRobinLoadBalance` and its unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWe will get more strictly balance result in unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-16T13:10:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T05:27:19Z","closed_at":"2018-10-26T05:27:18Z","merged_at":"2018-10-26T05:27:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"910b261a00066478f3e0d1dc8023771564981cfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/591cce93fbce18cd2e25e524d9b6e38ed97b4e11","head":{"label":"jasonjoo2010:SmoothWRR","ref":"SmoothWRR","sha":"591cce93fbce18cd2e25e524d9b6e38ed97b4e11","user":{"login":"jasonjoo2010","id":17573073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTczMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17573073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141798980,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3OTg5ODA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"jasonjoo2010/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jasonjoo2010","id":17573073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTczMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17573073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-10T03:03:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T05:48:24Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T05:48:24Z","merged_at":"2018-10-10T05:48:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"d73831895bc8dc9e85d6818571d6fa17a27ba404","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7296bbdca28759deb27dc7092f2d23639ecd5e89","head":{"label":"diecui1202:issue-1641-master","ref":"issue-1641-master","sha":"7296bbdca28759deb27dc7092f2d23639ecd5e89","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-09T10:18:56Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T12:10:41Z","closed_at":"2018-10-11T12:10:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abae7fd7d398df581135d059c79c033b4983872f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5b1e68bdeb945c4161620f16ad199bfed8a94e17","head":{"label":"dugenkui03:LRUCache-optimization","ref":"LRUCache-optimization","sha":"5b1e68bdeb945c4161620f16ad199bfed8a94e17","user":{"login":"dugenkui03","id":18216266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18216266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03","html_url":"https://github.com/dugenkui03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ccce69e75fd34a48f02899cb5a61c07742c17c43","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor issue: #2030\r\n\r\nURL works as the carrier for Dubbo internal data transfer at runtime, and is also works as a protocol integrating with the external system: registration center, service query, service management, etc., resulting in serious coupling between the configuration and the registration center, and the data load pushed by the registration center is too large.\r\n\r\nKeep URL unchanged at runtime, and even enrich the runtime URL; Keep the immutability of the URL during a single invoke from start to end.\r\nSimplify Registry url as much as possible.\r\nRefactor the way of doing service configuration, rely on Registry currently, switch to third-party Config Center while keeping compatible with old Overrides protocol.\r\nSome data in URL are for service query purpose, we should register this part to another place instead of Registry. And it should be realized as extensible and users can decide to enable it or not.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Add unit test \r\n* Simplify the class info and store metadata into servicestore\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-09T09:56:35Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T01:22:03Z","closed_at":"2018-10-15T01:22:03Z","merged_at":"2018-10-15T01:22:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"59dd98a06b6faf3d4e4a856d6b43f59b65da3d8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1dc5d3566b1de36fe60af75c08423526528ef8ec","head":{"label":"cvictory:dev-metadata","ref":"dev-metadata","sha":"1dc5d3566b1de36fe60af75c08423526528ef8ec","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-09T06:42:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T03:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T03:00:00Z","merged_at":"2018-10-10T03:00:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b94b35992259747611ffae2d807f87b4ed4b705","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/21/labels","id":3637379,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzYzNzM3OQ==","number":21,"title":"2.6.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":17,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-10T03:16:06Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T09:48:26Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-01-15T09:48:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e4b3f0eec112fe0d3f97d5fd6947d29b1130fc90","head":{"label":"diecui1202:issue-1641","ref":"issue-1641","sha":"e4b3f0eec112fe0d3f97d5fd6947d29b1130fc90","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nclose #1983\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThis Protobuf support is based on [Protostuff](https://github.com/protostuff/protostuff), so we don't need to write proto files by hand.\r\n\r\nAnd this PR is based on @vangoleo 's demo [here](https://github.com/vangoleo/incubator-dubbo/tree/protobuf).\r\n\r\nMaybe some benchmarks will be helpful, and I will add them later.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n^No tests written for this small contribution.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n^ both tasks fail on branch 2.6.x \r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n^ This is a small contribution.","created_at":"2018-10-08T15:04:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T02:26:22Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T00:50:29Z","merged_at":"2018-10-09T00:50:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4eb4e8ceb14965f2abd881b70ba6f1f994d3940","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/99babae7ff6e947059fee14cc2425aead46e6be8","head":{"label":"cbolgiano:remove-java9-travis-issue-2605","ref":"remove-java9-travis-issue-2605","sha":"99babae7ff6e947059fee14cc2425aead46e6be8","user":{"login":"cbolgiano","id":7445503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDU1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7445503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano","html_url":"https://github.com/cbolgiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152094403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTIwOTQ0MDM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"cbolgiano/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cbolgiano","id":7445503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDU1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7445503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano","html_url":"https://github.com/cbolgiano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbolgiano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cbolgiano/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T09:53:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T00:49:49Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T00:49:49Z","merged_at":"2018-10-09T00:49:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"046bc3081f7a98d539f9fb1b9af375ad80868ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef087aa991d52f2ac7698f527526268225f69b1f","head":{"label":"diecui1202:add-javadoc-plugin","ref":"add-javadoc-plugin","sha":"ef087aa991d52f2ac7698f527526268225f69b1f","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

@Method and @Argument annotation for MethodConfig and ArgumentConfig.\r\n* Make these annotation effecient. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T08:14:50Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T13:32:18Z","closed_at":"2019-02-25T13:32:17Z","merged_at":"2019-02-25T13:32:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c528d56b6e947fab85a6ec772ae50d0db2491cb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9bff5de0acd083122d474dd20df94cf14ee8c4ab","head":{"label":"cvictory:2.6.x_issue_2298","ref":"2.6.x_issue_2298","sha":"9bff5de0acd083122d474dd20df94cf14ee8c4ab","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T08:13:51Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T08:38:30Z","closed_at":"2018-10-08T08:38:30Z","merged_at":"2018-10-08T08:38:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"79ea2acba862ed31dec2615220e0accac49c3dfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0a14970af6b224da910f86664536c418a6d32d99","head":{"label":"diecui1202:add-javadoc-to-dubbo-all","ref":"add-javadoc-to-dubbo-all","sha":"0a14970af6b224da910f86664536c418a6d32d99","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-30T16:37:20Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:22:11Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T09:22:11Z","merged_at":"2018-10-30T09:22:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a116aa957a81478234076997426cfb6296c2040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/575192e9ecc59a2c933ddec706538ddc3fc4bb78","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:FailbackRegister-test","ref":"FailbackRegister-test","sha":"575192e9ecc59a2c933ddec706538ddc3fc4bb78","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"393ffce5df5ac94a209914623d9a10bf94ef3b13","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-30T03:10:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T03:55:10Z","closed_at":"2018-10-11T03:55:10Z","merged_at":"2018-10-11T03:55:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"adb5b0e3ed2a785b83b5bb48b9fdb7e63fa5ae30","assignee":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/58290c4e34ab3602dbe17b0f5b09e4997d9fbfd7","head":{"label":"gudegg:opt_roundrobin","ref":"opt_roundrobin","sha":"58290c4e34ab3602dbe17b0f5b09e4997d9fbfd7","user":{"login":"gudegg","id":13344666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ0NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13344666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg","html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":150834463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTA4MzQ0NjM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"gudegg/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gudegg","id":13344666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ0NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13344666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg","html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFor below two situations, the provider & consumer cache in ApplicationModel is not unique. \r\n\r\n1. create two ReferenceConfig for same service with different

interface=\"com.alibaba.dubbo.DemoService\" async=\"true\">\r\n</dubbo:reference>\r\n2. create two ServiceConfig for same service with different implementation.\r\n<bean id=\"demoService\"

uses interface+group+version for the cache unique serviceName. To support above two scenario, we are going to add hashCode for the unique serviceName.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-27T08:29:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-27T10:23:49Z","closed_at":"2018-09-27T09:48:09Z","merged_at":"2018-09-27T09:48:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"2faf5e71f8cdb732e0234359594c668f39d82157","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2f8dfa12db46139103e97f922ad0d8637880d97d","head":{"label":"x-ultimate:master","ref":"master","sha":"2f8dfa12db46139103e97f922ad0d8637880d97d","user":{"login":"x-ultimate","id":18657682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU3Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18657682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate","html_url":"https://github.com/x-ultimate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"755bbf92741d4fcfed52bf314a5971a53c46b00c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\norg.apache.dubbo.registry.supportAbstractRegistryFactory\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-26T14:36:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-27T16:14:24Z","closed_at":"2018-09-27T16:14:24Z","merged_at":"2018-09-27T16:14:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"040343b917a3989fe6fba30a6deddb8974a68bb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2bba4fadd8866615377cf03e6fd588e6be015b31","head":{"label":"356082462:master","ref":"master","sha":"2bba4fadd8866615377cf03e6fd588e6be015b31","user":{"login":"356082462","id":18222358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjIyMzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18222358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462","html_url":"https://github.com/356082462","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/356082462/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cd7ba294b22a9b392030fe5c6ee06247fc7868c1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-25T07:26:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T09:46:30Z","closed_at":"2018-09-25T09:46:30Z","merged_at":"2018-09-25T09:46:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fd352b6c3c4027c312b35b7b49ac82bf320f0ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f39fa8406398bdda8082044ee0fabb4c16c2c2b1","head":{"label":"diecui1202:issue2533","ref":"issue2533","sha":"f39fa8406398bdda8082044ee0fabb4c16c2c2b1","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-25T06:37:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T07:08:10Z","closed_at":"2018-09-25T07:08:09Z","merged_at":"2018-09-25T07:08:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d20194cadada4f131395e9d0fff0a89ca2fe3bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d712d546331202e69f754865e2f99bb537b36af6","head":{"label":"diecui1202:issue-2532","ref":"issue-2532","sha":"d712d546331202e69f754865e2f99bb537b36af6","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-20T02:53:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T03:32:09Z","closed_at":"2018-09-20T03:32:09Z","merged_at":"2018-09-20T03:32:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"b411a777b3d3111dcdea0cd6d88151b3358665b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce94d5b94c1e991465be8c353fbd14b7d35f3648","head":{"label":"diecui1202:issue-2534","ref":"issue-2534","sha":"ce94d5b94c1e991465be8c353fbd14b7d35f3648","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-09-18T03:00:11Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T01:04:01Z","closed_at":"2018-09-19T01:04:01Z","merged_at":"2018-09-19T01:04:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d3a6ab0c19b8182d8a8b0d907d0ed758e65c2a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4823c8f478f4c5ca4fb0a061195afb0317c21a5a","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue2507","ref":"issue2507","sha":"4823c8f478f4c5ca4fb0a061195afb0317c21a5a","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"10f08f2130c5323e8a93e298102103c344a2f5be","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-18T02:47:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T08:17:38Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T09:59:19Z","merged_at":"2018-09-21T09:59:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"84410f79602a561b26957dc5149f599efd44aa2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3c5bb0b0ae1d8f097f6fc43ddc20a83351841b40","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue235","ref":"issue235","sha":"3c5bb0b0ae1d8f097f6fc43ddc20a83351841b40","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"10f08f2130c5323e8a93e298102103c344a2f5be","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nput time-to-response badge in README\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-12T08:01:19Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T08:01:29Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T08:01:26Z","merged_at":"2018-09-12T08:01:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffed96faa95ddb7ad349cb9c1408fb4d19566063","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8c4a8cb83dbd3472b9682c761d400a59f33ec328","head":{"label":"beiwei30:readme","ref":"readme","sha":"8c4a8cb83dbd3472b9682c761d400a59f33ec328","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e1e6978bec999562cff96fd8fbc9506b1047a7f5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-11T14:26:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T01:49:21Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T01:35:21Z","merged_at":"2018-09-12T01:35:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1e6978bec999562cff96fd8fbc9506b1047a7f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5e3c1b806b7b451c72c5bd24635bb6c10dd49760","head":{"label":"kun-song:update-readme","ref":"update-readme","sha":"5e3c1b806b7b451c72c5bd24635bb6c10dd49760","user":{"login":"kun-song","id":4010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song","html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131380726,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzODA3MjY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"kun-song/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kun-song","id":4010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song","html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor issue: #2030\r\n\r\nURL works as the carrier for Dubbo internal data transfer at runtime, and is also works as a protocol integrating with the external system: registration center, service query, service management, etc., resulting in serious coupling between the configuration and the registration center, and the data load pushed by the registration center is too large.\r\n\r\nKeep URL unchanged at runtime, and even enrich the runtime URL; Keep the immutability of the URL during a single invoke from start to end.\r\nSimplify Registry url as much as possible.\r\nRefactor the way of doing service configuration, rely on Registry currently, switch to third-party Config Center while keeping compatible with old Overrides protocol.\r\nSome data in URL are for service query purpose, we should register this part to another place instead of Registry. And it should be realized as extensible and users can decide to enable it or not.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Define a new SPI for store service data.  ServiceStore & ServiceStoreFactory\r\n* Remove some parameter from registry . Make it simple.  Refer to : https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2030#issuecomment-418938829\r\n* Implement the SPI with zookeeper as an example.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-07T08:18:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T08:53:47Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T08:53:47Z","merged_at":"2018-09-07T08:53:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"f27c5a7383784188ecc6f6a04c414521279e1bfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2465/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2465/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2465/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c919579d48dd7817f0ae44e8a58042663d4bd910","head":{"label":"gongchangwangpi:master","ref":"master","sha":"c919579d48dd7817f0ae44e8a58042663d4bd910","user":{"login":"gongchangwangpi","id":13031640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDMxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13031640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi","html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146415553,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY0MTU1NTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"gongchangwangpi/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gongchangwangpi","id":13031640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDMxNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13031640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi","html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangwangpi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangwangpi/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDubbo By default, all service calls between a Provider and a Consumer instance share a tcp connection. In high concurrency situations, there will be a 40ms network delay, which is caused by the tcp throughput algorithm related restrictions (note, Dubbo has closed Nagel). So in order to avoid this network delay, dubbo supports separate tcp connection configuration for some services (for example, configure connections=\"2\" in dubbo:reference to use two separate tcp connections for the service call). Why not change the default shared 1 tcp connection to dynamic configuration?

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn
