What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the metric response for non executable commands (and the executedPlan generation)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSQL command can be of 2 types:\r\n1) Executable (i.e. `show tables`). They are eagerly executed and return a response. The execution can generate metrics that should be returned to the user.\r\n2) Non executable. They are lazy and are not executed. As such they should not generate metrics.\r\nWe currently generate a executedPlan for both command & relations to attach the metrics. This is a performance concern for relations as generating the optimized & physical can take some time. Furthermore, streaming SQL relations cannot generate a physical plan in the same way (i.e. they need to use read / write stream). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, SQL non-executable commands will no longer return a metric response.

Closing this in favor of #43851\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis illustrates a bug in Spark Connect when we run an SQL command on streaming temp view.\r\nThat fix here avoids triggering physical plan on streaming dataframes (as a result does not include metrics in response).\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").option(\"numPartitions\", \"1\").load()\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"temp_view\")\r\n\r\nview_df = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM temp_view\") # FAILS\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes a regression in Spark Connect compared to legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Added a pyspark test.\r\n - Manually with repro code above\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new rule to remove redundant shuffles from the Spark plan if it and its child is not reused.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduce shuffle to improve query performance. The use case is user add a repartition to increase parallelism for broadcast join, but this is useless for shuffle join.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `Python 3.10` to Infra docker images.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a preparation to add a daily `Python 3.10` GitHub Action job later for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nNote that Python 3.10 is installed at the last step to avoid the following issues which happens when we install Python 3.9 and 3.10 at the same stage by package manager.\r\n```\r\n#21 13.03 ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'blinker'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.\r\n#21 ERROR: process \"/bin/sh -c python3.9 -m pip install numpy 'pyarrow>=14.0.0' 'pandas<=2.1.3' scipy unittest-xml-reporting plotly>=4.8 'mlflow>=2.3.1' coverage matplotlib openpyxl 'memory-profiler==0.60.0' 'scikit-learn==1.1.*'\" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. I verified that the Python CI is not affected and still use Python 3.9.5 only.\r\n```\r\n========================================================================\r\nRunning PySpark tests\r\n========================================================================\r\nRunning PySpark tests. Output is in /__w/spark/spark/python/unit-tests.log\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python3.9']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-errors']\r\npython3.9 python_implementation is CPython\r\npython3.9 version is: Python 3.9.5\r\nStarting test(python3.9): pyspark.errors.tests.test_errors (temp output: /__w/spark/spark/python/target/fd967f24-3607-4aa6-8190-3f8d7de522e1/python3.9__pyspark.errors.tests.test_errors___zauwgy1.log)\r\nFinished test(python3.9): pyspark.errors.tests.test_errors (0s)\r\nTests passed in 0 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Pass `Base Image Build` step for new Python 3.10.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 10 53 37 AM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/9700541/6bbb3461-c5f0-4d60-94f6-7cd8df0594ed)\r\n\r\n3. Since new Python 3.10 is not used in CI, we need to validate like the following. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/dongjoon-hyun/apache-spark-ci-image:master-6895105871 python3.10

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43797\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nGROUP BY ordinal is not idempotent today. If the ordinal points to another integer literal and the plan get analyzed again, we will re-do the ordinal resolution which can lead to wrong result or index out-of-bound error. This PR fixes it by using a hack: if the ordinal points to another integer literal, don't replace the ordinal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor advanced users or Spark plugins, they may manipulate the logical plans directly. We need to make the framework more reliable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43797\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nGROUP BY ordinal is not idempotent today. If the ordinal points to another integer literal and the plan get analyzed again, we will re-do the ordinal resolution which can lead to wrong result or index out-of-bound error. This PR fixes it by using a hack: if the ordinal points to another integer literal, don't replace the ordinal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor advanced users or Spark plugins, they may manipulate the logical plans directly. We need to make the framework more reliable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nno","created_at":"2023-11-16T09:05:34Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T16:19:04Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T16:19:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a84ad160dfcb17fec6a7ddf951e54547df0ee85b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f947e38f42b7ace2aeefb094424ee2c7447afac5","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:3.4-port","ref":"3.4-port","sha":"f947e38f42b7ace2aeefb094424ee2c7447afac5","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

If the ordinal points to another integer literal and the plan get analyzed again, we will re-do the ordinal resolution which can lead to wrong result or index out-of-bound error. This PR fixes it by using a hack: if the ordinal points to another integer literal, don't replace the ordinal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor advanced users or Spark plugins, they may manipulate the logical plans directly. We need to make the framework more reliable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR mainly does two things:\r\n1. It revert a line of code in `IvyTestUtils.scala` that was mistakenly deleted in SPARK-45506 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43354 to ensure that the `ivy.xml` file generated by `IvyTestUtils#createIvyDescriptor` is complete. Before this PR, the generated `ivy.xml` file would missing the `</ivy-module>` end tag, which would cause two test cases in `MavenUtilsSuite` to fail. We can reproduce the problem by executing the `build/sbt \"common-utils/test\"` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] MavenUtilsSuite:\r\n[info] - incorrect maven coordinate throws error (8 milliseconds)\r\n[info] -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make single-pod Spark jobs respect `spark.app.id` in K8s environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.4.0, SPARK-42190 allows users to run single-pod Spark jobs in K8s environment by utilizing `LocalSchedulerBackend` in the driver pod. However, `LocalSchedulerBackend` doesn't respect `spark.app.id` while `KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend` does. This PR aims to improve K8s UX by reducing the behavior difference between single-pod Spark jobs and multi-pod Spark jobs in K8s environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but it's more consistent with the existing general K8s jobs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-16T07:36:04Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T08:32:14Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T08:32:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5741851a4cc3d54dda81c0779caa6bd6f57dd777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43833/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43833/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43833/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a87662c9a93185552e7f10a27b5ca797e47a4af8","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-45948","ref":"SPARK-45948","sha":"a87662c9a93185552e7f10a27b5ca797e47a4af8","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

When we run the streaming query, state store is being initialized in to the executor, and registration is performed against the coordinator in driver. The lifecycle of the state store provider is not strictly tied to the the lifecycle of the streaming query - the executor closes the state store provider when coordinator indicates to the executor that the state store provider is no longer valid, which is not immediately after the streaming query has stopped. The lifecycle of the state store provider can overlap among tests.\r\n\r\nThis means maintenance task against the provider can run after test A. We are clearing the temp directory in test A after the test A has completed, which can break the operation being performed against state store provider being used in test A. E.g. directory no longer exists while maintenance task is running.\r\n\r\nThis won't be an issue in practice because we do not expect the checkpoint location to be temporary, but it is indeed an issue for how we setup and cleanup env for tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo deflake the test.","created_at":"2023-11-16T05:50:07Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T22:29:18Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T22:27:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"731f45405e60b195866a0250f0f58c32291b9cb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c08ad8163d0281b670b2310a05a827ef25b727a","head":{"label":"chaoqin-li1123:fix_state_reader_suite","ref":"fix_state_reader_suite","sha":"7c08ad8163d0281b670b2310a05a827ef25b727a","user":{"login":"chaoqin-li1123","id":55518381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55518381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":538626126,"node_id":"R_kgDOIBrITg","name":"spark","full_name":"chaoqin-li1123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaoqin-li1123","id":55518381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55518381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change in this PR is to augment the trait of SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering by adding two new methods\r\n`default boolean equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters(Scan other) {\r\n    return this.equals(other);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default int hashCodeIgnoreRuntimeFilters() {\r\n    return this.hashCode();\r\n  }`\r\n\r\nwhich the underlying V2 Scan should implement.\r\nThe BatchScanExec also gets modified accordingly where it invokes this two methods to check the equality of the Scan.\r\n\r\nPls note that this PR includes code of 2 other PRs too\r\n1) [SPARK-45658](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43737)\r\nThis PR though not required per se, but is good to have for correctness ( & my other PR for broadcast var pushdown relies on this  fix)\r\n2) [SPARK-45926](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43808)\r\nThis PR is necessary to reproduce the issue and hence its code is needed for this PR to show the issue.\r\n\r\n**Also for this test to pass the code of DataSourceV2Relation.computeStats should disable throwing assertion error in testing, as that is a separate bug which gets hit, when the bug test for this PR is run.. So for now to allow the bug test to pass, I have modified the Utils.isTesting to avoid hitting the IllegalStateException**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is need IMO to fix the issue of re-use of exchange not happening when DPP filters are pushed to the scan level.\r\nThe issue is this:\r\nIn certain types of queries for eg TPCDS Query 14b, the reuse of exchange does not happen in AQE , resulting in perf degradation.\r\nThe spark TPCDS tests are unable to catch the problem, because the InMemoryScan used for testing do not implement the equals & hashCode correctly , in the sense , that they do take into account the pushed down run time filters.\r\n\r\nIn concrete Scan implementations, for eg iceberg's SparkBatchQueryScan , the equality check , apart from other things, also involves Runtime Filters pushed ( which is correct).\r\n\r\nBelow is description of how this issue surfaces.\r\nFor a given stage being materialized, just before materialization starts, the run time filters are confined to the BatchScanExec level.\r\nOnly when the actual RDD corresponding to the BatchScanExec, is being evaluated, do the runtime filters get pushed to the underlying Scan.\r\n\r\nNow if a new stage is created and it checks in the stageCache using its canonicalized plan to see if a stage can be reused, it fails to find the r-usable stage even if the stage exists, because the canonicalized spark plan present in the stage cache, has now the run time filters pushed to the Scan , so the incoming canonicalized spark plan does not match the key as their underlying scans differ . that is incoming spark plan's scan does not have runtime filters , while the canonicalized spark plan present as key in the stage cache has the scan with runtime filters pushed.\r\n\r\nThe fix as I have worked is to provide, two methods in the SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering interface ,\r\ndefault boolean equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters(Scan other)\r\n\r\n{ return this.equals(other); }\r\ndefault int hashCodeIgnoreRuntimeFilters()\r\n\r\n{ return this.hashCode(); }\r\nIn the BatchScanExec, if the scan implements SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering, then instead of batch.equals, it should call scan.equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters\r\n\r\nAnd the underlying Scan implementations should provide equality which excludes run time filters.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the hashCode of

However, there is an edge case: when a streaming query is stopped on the driver, it interrupts the stream execution thread. If the streaming query is doing memory store operations on driver and performs doPutIterator at the same time, the [unroll process will be broken](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39fc6108bfaaa0ce471f6460880109f948ba5c62/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/memory/MemoryStore.scala#L224) and [returns used memory](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39fc6108bfaaa0ce471f6460880109f948ba5c62/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/memory/MemoryStore.scala#L245-L247).\r\n\r\nThis can result in closeChannelException as it falls into this [case clause](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/aa646d3050028272f7333deaef52f20e6975e0ed/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManager.scala#L1614-L1622) which opens an I/O channel and persists the data into the disk. However, because the thread is interrupted, the channel will be closed at the begin: https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/nio/channels/spi/AbstractInterruptibleChannel.java#L172 and throws out closeChannelException\r\n\r\nOn executors, [the task will be killed if the thread is interrupted](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39fc6108bfaaa0ce471f6460880109f948ba5c62/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/memory/MemoryStore.scala#L374), however, we don't do it on the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark has a (long-standing) overflow bug in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\nConsider the following operations:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE foo (l LONG);\")\r\nspark.sql(s\"INSERT INTO foo VALUES (${Long.MaxValue});\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT sequence(0, l) FROM foo;\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of these operations will be:\r\n```\r\nArray[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([WrappedArray()])\r\n```\r\nan unintended consequence of overflow.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is applied to values `0` and `Long.MaxValue` with a step size of `1` which uses a length computation defined [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3451). In this calculation, with `start = 0`, `stop = Long.MaxValue`, and `step = 1`, the calculated `len` overflows to `Long.MinValue`. The computation, in binary looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n- 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n/ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n+ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following [check](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3454) passes as the negative `Long.MinValue` is still `<= MAX_ROUNDED_ARRAY_LENGTH`. The following cast to `toInt` uses this representation and [truncates the upper bits](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3457) resulting in an empty length of `0`.\r\n\r\nOther overflows are similarly problematic.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by checking numeric operations in the length computation for overflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a correctness bug from overflow in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark has a (long-standing) overflow bug in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\nConsider the following operations:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE foo (l LONG);\")\r\nspark.sql(s\"INSERT INTO foo VALUES (${Long.MaxValue});\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT sequence(0, l) FROM foo;\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of these operations will be:\r\n```\r\nArray[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([WrappedArray()])\r\n```\r\nan unintended consequence of overflow.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is applied to values `0` and `Long.MaxValue` with a step size of `1` which uses a length computation defined [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3451). In this calculation, with `start = 0`, `stop = Long.MaxValue`, and `step = 1`, the calculated `len` overflows to `Long.MinValue`. The computation, in binary looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n- 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n/ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n+ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following [check](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3454) passes as the negative `Long.MinValue` is still `<= MAX_ROUNDED_ARRAY_LENGTH`. The following cast to `toInt` uses this representation and [truncates the upper bits](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3457) resulting in an empty length of `0`.\r\n\r\nOther overflows are similarly problematic.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by checking numeric operations in the length computation for overflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a correctness bug from overflow in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests added in

In this calculation, with `start = 0`, `stop = Long.MaxValue`, and `step = 1`, the calculated `len` overflows to `Long.MinValue`. The computation, in binary looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n- 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n/ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n+ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following [check](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3454) passes as the negative `Long.MinValue` is still `<= MAX_ROUNDED_ARRAY_LENGTH`. The following cast to `toInt` uses this representation and [truncates the upper bits](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3457) resulting in an empty length of `0`.\r\n\r\nOther overflows are similarly problematic.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by checking numeric operations in the length computation for overflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a correctness bug from overflow in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe common type of decimal(x, 0) and string is double. But the common type of int/bigint and string are int/bigint.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `PromoteStrings` make the common type of decimal(x, 0) and string is decimal(x, 0).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Make decimal(x, 0) behave the same as int/bigint in `PromoteStrings`.\r\n2. Reduce one cast in binary comparison so we may use bucket read. For example: `cast(stringCol as double) = cast(decimalCol as double)` vs `cast(stringCol as decimal(x, 0)) = decimalCol`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The result type of decimal(x, 0) and string is decimal(x, 0) in binary comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR supports non-deterministic UDFs in MapInPandas and MapInArrow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, MapInPandas and MapInArrow do not support non-deterministic UDFs. The analyzer will fail with this error:\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [INVALID_NON_DETERMINISTIC_EXPRESSIONS] The operator expects a deterministic expression, but the actual expression is \"pyUDF()\"`.\r\n\r\nThis is needed for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43791.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Users cannot directly create a non-deterministic UDF in PySpark to be used in MapInPandas/MapInArrow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplementing equals and hashCode in the InMemoryBatchScan and  InMemoryV2FilterBatchScan so that the pushed runtime filters are taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese test classes need the change so that the issue of re-use of exchange not happening in AQE when runtime filters are pushed to scan levels,  can be reproduced. Currently either the tests are not actually validating the reuse of exchange happening when dynamic pruning expressions are pushed to scan levels in partitioned key based joins, or they are false passing because the equality of the test scans are not taking into account runtime filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is test class change., It is possibe that the existing tests may fail till the dependent fixes are made in source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplementing equals and hashCode in SubqueryBroadcastExec so that it is made equivalent to SubqueryAdaptiveBroadcastExec . During the bug testing and fix for re-use of exchange in AQE, it turned out that the first exchange got created with SubqueryAdaptiveBroadcastExec, while another incoming exchange which is as such identical to the existing one, but differed as it was having SubqueryBroadcastExec, which contributed to re-use of exchange not happening.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNeeded so that reuse of exchange happens correctly in AQE\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test for checking the equivalence with SubqueryAdaptiveBroadcastExec.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change introduces a new functionality in the `parquet` method of the DataFrameWriter class to handle the writing of empty DataFrames to Parquet files, particularly when using partitioning. Previously, writing an empty DataFrame with partitions specified did not create any output in the target directory, which could lead to issues in subsequent jobs expecting files with the defined schema. Now, `parquet` method will check if the DataFrame is empty and if partitions are specified. If both conditions are true, private method `_write_empty_partition` is called to handle the empty DataFrame write operation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change addresses the issue reported in [SPARK-45908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45908) regarding the handling of empty DataFrames with partitions in PySpark's Parquet writing functionality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGROUP BY ordinal is not idempotent today. If the ordinal points to another integer literal and the plan get analyzed again, we will re-do the ordinal resolution which can lead to wrong result or index out-of-bound error. This PR fixes it by using a hack: if the ordinal points to another integer literal, don't replace the ordinal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Remove trailing slash from Conda cheat sheet URL in 'Using Conda' section.\r\n- Correct the Miniconda documentation URL by removing the trailing slash.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn addition to removing the trailing slash from the Conda cheat sheet URL in the 'Using Conda' section, this update also corrects the Miniconda documentation URL in the same section by removing the trailing slash. These modifications are intended to resolve the 404 errors that occur when the current URLs with the trailing slashes are accessed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are necessary because the existing URLs with trailing slashes lead to 404 errors, hindering users' access to the Conda cheat sheet and Miniconda documentation. Removing the slashes will ensure the links direct users to the correct webpages, improving the documentation's usability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This change only affects the documentation and does not alter the functionality of the Spark software itself.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBoth documentation fixes were visually inspected to ensure the corrected URLs resolve to the intended webpages without 404 errors. No additional code testing is necessary as these changes are strictly within the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to hide the internal attributes from errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should expose only user APIs to the surface, e.g. `getErrorClass`, `getMessageParameters` and `getSqlState`, but currently there are some internal attributes such as `error_reader`, `message`, `error_class` and `message_parameters` are exposed as an user API as below:\r\n<img width=\"680\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 9 09 54 AM\"

change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the internal attributes are explicitly marked as private from user space:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"676\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 9 17 41 AM\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR clarifies that collect_list and collect_set return a standard [ArrayType ](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.types.ArrayType.html)s and not some new special list or set type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current description causes confusion about what type this function returns. This change makes it more in line with [the Databricks versions for collect_list](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/collect_list.html) and [collect_set ](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/collect_set.html) as well. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt improves the documentation\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43630 which proposes to support Python Data Source can be with SQL (in favour of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43949), SparkR and all other exiting combinations by wrapping the Python Data Source by DSv2 interface (but yet uses `V1Table` interface).\r\n\r\nThe approach is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. PySpark registers a Python Data Source with its short name.\r\n2. Later, when the Data Sources are looked up, JVM creates a class that inherits DSv2 class dynamically that has the same short name as registered in Python.\r\n3. The returned class invokes Python Data Source, and works wherever it works with DSv2 even including SparkR, Scala, all SQL places.\r\n\r\nSelf-contained working example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.datasource import DataSource, DataSourceReader, InputPartition\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSourceReader(DataSourceReader):\r\n    def __init__(self, options):\r\n        self.options = options\r\n    def partitions(self):\r\n        return [InputPartition(i) for i in range(3)]\r\n    def read(self, partition):\r\n        yield partition.value, str(partition.value)\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSource(DataSource):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def name(cls):\r\n        return \"test\"\r\n    def schema(self):\r\n        return \"x INT, y STRING\"\r\n    def reader(self, schema) -> \"DataSourceReader\":\r\n        return TestDataSourceReader(self.options)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.dataSource.register(TestDataSource)\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE tblA USING test\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * from tblA\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  x|  y|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  0|  0|\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  2|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n_There are limitations and followups to make:_\r\n\r\n1. ~~We should change the dynamically generated classname from `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.PythonTableScan` to something else that maps to individual Python Data Source so the classes are not confused.~~\r\n2. Whenever you load Python Data Source, it creates a new class dynamically generated. Should probably cache. (SPARK-45916)\r\n3. If you save this table after you restart your driver, the table cannot be loaded because the dynamically generated class does not exist anymore. Should figure out the way of reloading them (SPARK-45916 and SPARK-45917)\r\n4. ~~Multi-paths are not supported (inherited from DSv1). Relates to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16611~~, resolved by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43809\r\n5. ~~Using a wrapper of DSv1 might be a blocker to implement commit protocol in Python Data Source.~~. From my code reading, it'd be still possible.\r\n6. Statically loading Python Data Sources is still not supported (SPARK-45917)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for Python Data Source to be able to be used in all other place including SparkR, Scala together.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users can register their Python Data Source, and use them in SQL, SparkR, etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and manually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCloses

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20023 .\r\n\r\nIt's simply wrong to cut the decimal precision to 38 if a wider decimal type exceeds the max precision, which drops the integral digits and makes the decimal value very likely to overflow.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20023 , we fixed this issue for arithmetic operations, but many other operations suffer from the same issue: Union, binary comparison, in subquery, create_array, coalesce, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all the remaining operators, without the min scale limitation, which should be applied to division and multiple only according to the SQL server doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/precision-scale-and-length-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo produce reasonable wider decimal type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the final data type of these operators will be changed if it's decimal type and its precision exceeds the max and the scale is not 0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the Python UDF error messages to be more actionable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSuppose you face a segfault error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nimport ctypes\r\nspark.range(1).select(udf(lambda x: ctypes.string_at(0))(\"id\")).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current error message is not actionable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  ...\r\nget_return_value\r\n    raise Py4JJavaError(\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o82.collectToPython.\r\n: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 15 in stage 1.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 15.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 31) (192.168.123.102 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException:\r\nPython worker exited unexpectedly (crashed)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, it fixes the error message as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  ...\r\nget_return_value\r\n    raise Py4JJavaError(\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error

0.0 (TID 15) (192.168.123.102 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException:\r\nPython worker exited unexpectedly (crashed). Consider setting 'spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.faulthandler.enabled'\r\nor 'spark.python.worker.faulthandler.enabled' configuration to 'true' forthe better Python traceback.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you can try this out\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nimport ctypes\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.faulthandler.enabled\", \"true\")\r\nspark.range(1).select(udf(lambda x: ctypes.string_at(0))(\"id\")).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat now shows where the segfault happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Python worker exited unexpectedly (crashed): Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault\r\n\r\nCurrent thread 0x00007ff84ae4b700 (most recent call first):\r\n  File

as above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-13T04:41:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:21Z","closed_at":"2023-11-13T08:40:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94a9c7f49aea4acafc9616740f15e5d9a4606918","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfb0be2dbd92c54548fb4cb6d7cd365524f5cbc6","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-error-improvement","ref":"minor-error-improvement","sha":"cfb0be2dbd92c54548fb4cb6d7cd365524f5cbc6","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Therefore, for element types `Option[Seq/Date/Timestamp/BigDecimal]`, `ValidateExternalType` will try to validate that the element is of the contained type (e.g., `BigDecimal`) rather than of type `Option`. Since the element type is of type `Option`, the validation fails.\r\n\r\nValidation currently works by accident for element types `Option[Map/<primitive-type]`, simply because in that case `ValidateExternalType` ignores that passed expected type and tries to validate based on the encoder's `clsTag` field (which, for the `OptionEncoder`, will be class `Option`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this

For example, the existing `zookeeper`-related configuration in `Configuration -> Deploy` section although it's only applicable in `Spark Standalone` cluster. In addition, it's partially described. We had better move it to `Spark Standalone` page.\r\n    - From: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#deploy\r\n    - To: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html\r\n\r\n2. Add missing configurations.\r\n    - spark.dead.worker.persistence\r\n\r\n3. Revise the default value\r\n   - spark.deploy.defaultCores\r\n\r\n3. Add all Spark 4.0.0 configurations.\r\n    - spark.deploy.maxDrivers\r\n    - spark.deploy.appNumberModulo\r\n    - spark.deploy.driverIdPattern\r\n    - spark.deploy.appIdPattern\r\n    -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43427\r\n\r\n\r\nProtobuf supports unsigned integer types, including uint32 and uint64. When deserializing protobuf values with fields of these types, `from_protobuf` currently transforms them to the spark types of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuint32 => IntegerType\r\nuint64 => LongType\r\n```\r\n\r\nIntegerType and LongType are [signed](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html) integer types, so this can lead to confusing results. Namely, if a uint32 value in a stored proto is above 2^31 or a uint64 value is above 2^63, their representation in binary will contain a 1 in the highest bit, which when interpreted as a signed integer will be negative (I.e. overflow). No information is lost, as `IntegerType` and `LongType` contain 32 and 64 bits respectively, however their representation can be confusing.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add an option (`upcast.unsigned.ints`) to allow upcasting unsigned integer types into a larger integer type that can represent them natively, i.e. \r\n\r\n```\r\nuint32 => LongType\r\nuint64 => Decimal(20, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added an option so that it doesn't break any existing clients.\r\n\r\n**Example of current behavior**\r\n\r\nConsider a protobuf message like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\n\r\nmessage Test {\r\n  uint64 val = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we compile the above and then generate a message with a value for `val` above 2^63:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport test_pb2\r\n\r\ns = test_pb2.Test()\r\ns.val = 9223372036854775809 # 2**63 + 1\r\nserialized = s.SerializeToString()\r\nprint(serialized)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis generates the binary representation:\r\n\r\nb'\\x08\\x81\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x01'\r\n\r\nThen, deserializing this using `from_protobuf`, we can see that it is represented as a negative number. I did this in a notebook so its easier to see, but could reproduce in a scala test as well:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1002986/7144e6a9-3f43-455e-94c3-9065ae88206e)\r\n\r\n**Precedent**\r\nI believe that unsigned integer types in parquet are deserialized in a similar manner, i.e. put into a larger type so that the unsigned representation natively fits. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34817 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31921. So an option to get similar behavior would be useful.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove unsigned integer deserialization behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds a new option.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit Testing\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Rewrite catalog table APIs to use unresolved logical plan (i.e. UnresolvedTableOrView) and return the result based on the analyzed logical plans.\r\n- Remove the Hive index table support for `getTable` and `tableExists` APIs (i.e. throws AnalyzeException instead) since [indexing is removed since 3.0](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/hive/languagemanual+indexing) so that the behavior is consistent with SQL (e.g. DESCRIBE TABLE). Though `listTables` still works for the Hive index tables\r\n- Put the entire view metadata in ResolvedTempView and ResolvedPersistentView.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Less duplicate logics. We should not directly invoke catalog APIs, but go through analyzer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating a serializer for a `Map` or `Seq` with an element of type `Option`, pass an expected type of `Option`  to `ValidateExternalType` rather than the `Option`'s type argument.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn 3.4.1, 3.5.0, and master, the following code gets an error:\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq(Seq(Some(Seq(0)))).toDF(\"a\")\r\nval df = Seq(Seq(Some(Seq(0)))).toDF(\"a\")\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [EXPRESSION_ENCODING_FAILED] Failed to encode a value of the expressions: mapobjects(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -1), mapobjects(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -2), assertnotnull(validateexternaltype(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -2), IntegerType, IntegerType)), unwrapoption(ObjectType(interface scala.collection.immutable.Seq), validateexternaltype(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -1), ArrayType(IntegerType,false), ObjectType(class scala.Option))), None), input[0, scala.collection.immutable.Seq, true], None) AS value#0 to a row. SQLSTATE: 42846\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: scala.Some is not a valid external type for schema of array<int>\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.MapObjects_0$(Unknown Source)\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, this code works in 3.3.3.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, this code gets an error:\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq(Seq(Some(java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(\"2023-01-01 00:00:00\")))).toDF(\"a\")\r\nval df = Seq(Seq(Some(java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(\"2023-01-01 00:00:00\")))).toDF(\"a\")\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [EXPRESSION_ENCODING_FAILED] Failed to encode a value of the expressions: mapobjects(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -1), staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtils$, TimestampType, fromJavaTimestamp, unwrapoption(ObjectType(class java.sql.Timestamp), validateexternaltype(lambdavariable(MapObject, ObjectType(class java.lang.Object), true, -1), TimestampType, ObjectType(class scala.Option))), true, false, true), input[0, scala.collection.immutable.Seq, true], None) AS value#0 to a row. SQLSTATE: 42846\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: scala.Some is not a valid external type for schema of timestamp\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs with the first example, this code works in 3.3.3.\r\n\r\n`SerializerBuildHelper#validateAndSerializeElement` will construct `ValidateExternalType` with an expected type of the `Option`'s type parameter. Therefore, for element types `Option[Seq/Date/Timestamp/BigDecimal]`, `ValidateExternalType` will try to validate that the element is of the contained type (e.g., `BigDecimal`) rather than of type `Option`. Since the element type is of type `Option`, the validation fails.\r\n\r\nValidation currently works by accident for element types `Option[Map/<primitive-type]`, simply because in that case `ValidateExternalType` ignores that passed expected type and tries to validate based on the encoder's `clsTag` field (which, for the `OptionEncoder`, will be class `Option`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOther than fixing the bug, no.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-22548 fixed incorrect nested AND expression pushed down to JDBC data source. But Parquet/ORC data sources do not need that fix because they always keep the `Filter` node.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>For example</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE parquet_table (name string, theid int) using parquet;\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM parquet_table WHERE (THEID > 0 AND TRIM(NAME) = 'mary') OR (NAME = 'fred');\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- Before SPARK-22548\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Filter (((THEID#21 > 0) && (trim(NAME#20) = mary)) || (NAME#20 = fred))\r\n+- *FileScan parquet default.parquet_table[name#20,theid#21] PushedFilters: [Or(GreaterThan(theid,0),EqualTo(name,fred))]\r\n\r\n-- After SPARK-22548(Actually we can push down [Or(GreaterThan(theid,0),EqualTo(name,fred))] to data source)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Filter (((THEID#21 > 0) && (trim(NAME#20) = mary)) || (NAME#20 = fred))\r\n+- *FileScan parquet default.parquet_table[name#20,theid#21] PushedFilters: []\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a function parameter(named `canPartialPushDown`) to `DataSourceStrategy.translateFilter`. The caller side can set it to true if caller side always keep the `Filter` node to push down more filters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPushdown more filters to improve query performance. This is a very common case and can significantly improve query performance. For example:\r\n```sql\r\n1. id IN (1677950,1468757,2059706,2053742,2047936,5387,2046791) OR (id=2351460 and very_heavy_udf(very_large_column, 'key') = 'EXPC')\r\n2. (id IN (4279154) AND very_heavy_udf(very_large_column, 'key') IS NOT NULL) OR\r\n(id = 3914 AND very_heavy_udf(very_large_column, 'sid') = 'p.2380')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test:\r\nBefore | After\r\n-- | --\r\n<img width=\"435\" alt=\"image\"

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the scenario of hive table scan, by configuring the hadoop.mapred.max.split.size parameter, you can increase the parallelism of the scan hive table stage, thereby reducing the running time.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a large table and a small table are in the same query, if only a separate hadoop.mapred.max.split.size parameter is configured, some stages will run a very large number of tasks, and some stages will The number of tasks running is very small. For runtime tasks, the hadoop.mapred.max.split.size parameter can be set separately for each hive table to ensure this balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf a large table and a small table are in the same query, if only a separate hadoop.mapred.max.split.size parameter is configured, some stages will run a very large number of tasks, and some stages will The number of tasks running is very small. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44001\r\n\r\nUnder com.google.protobuf, there are some [well known primitive wrapper types](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto), useful for distinguishing between absence of primitive fields and their default values, as well as for use within `google.protobuf.Any` types. These types are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDoubleValue\r\nFloatValue\r\nInt64Value\r\nUint64Value\r\nInt32Value\r\nUint32Value\r\nBoolValue\r\nStringValue\r\nBytesValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we deserialize these from a serialized protobuf into a spark struct, we expand them as if they were normal messages. Concretely, if we have\r\n\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\n\r\nimport \"google/protobuf/wrappers.proto\"\r\n\r\nmessage WktExample {\r\n  google.protobuf.BoolValue bool_val = 1;\r\n  google.protobuf.Int32Value int32_val = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a message like\r\n\r\n```\r\nWktExample(true, 100)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the behavior today is to deserialize this as.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"bool_val\": {\"value\": true}, \"int32_val\": {\"value\": 100}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is quite difficult to work with and not in the spirit of the wrapper type, so it would be nice to have an option to unwrap them when deserializing, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"bool_val\": true, \"int32_val\": 100}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also the default behavior by other popular deserialization libraries, including java protobuf util [Jsonformat](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/92619cdd433c5eed314d6b871060ac2340f52906/java/util/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf/util/JsonFormat.java#L761-L777) and golangs [jsonpb](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/f67b8970b736e53dbd7d0a27146c8f1ac52f74e5/jsonpb/jsonpb.go#L207-L214).\r\n\r\nSo for consistency with other libraries and improved usability, I add a deserialization option, `unwrap.protobuf.wkt` to enable this behavior. I add an option to avoid breaking any existing clients.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved usability and consistency with other deserialization libraries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, deserialization of well known types will change from the struct format to the inline format.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test testing every well known type deserialization explicitly, as well as testing roundtrip.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is an upgrade ticket to bump the Jetty version from 9 to 10.\r\nThis PR aims to bring incremental Jetty upgrades to Spark, as Jetty 9 support already reached EOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nJetty 9 is already beyond EOL, which means that we won't receive any security fix onward for Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, SNI host check is now defaulted to true on embedded Jetty, hence set it back to false to maintain backward compatibility.\r\nDespite the redirect behaviour changed for trailing /, but modern browser should be able to pick up the 302 status code and perform redirect accordingly, hence there is no impact on user level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nJunit test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

the 'Using Conda' section of the Spark documentation, the cheat sheet URL includes a trailing slash, causing a 404 error when accessed. \r\n\r\nThis commit removes the trailing slash to ensure the URL correctly directs to the intended page.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe proposed change removes the trailing slash from the Conda cheat sheet URL in the 'Using Conda' section of the Spark documentation. This modification is intended to resolve the 404 error that occurs when the current URL with the trailing slash is accessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is necessary because the existing URL with a trailing slash leads to a 404 error, hindering users' access to the Conda cheat sheet. Removing the slash will ensure the link directs users to the correct webpage, improving the documentation's usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This change only affects the documentation and does not alter the functionality of the Spark software itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis documentation fix was visually inspected to ensure the corrected URL resolves to the intended webpage without a 404 error. No additional code testing is necessary as this change is strictly within the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

to fix 404 error\r\n\r\nIn the 'Using Conda' section of the Spark documentation, the cheat sheet URL includes a trailing slash, causing a 404 error when accessed. \r\n\r\nThis commit removes the trailing slash to ensure the URL correctly directs to the intended page.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe proposed change removes the trailing slash from the Conda cheat sheet URL in the 'Using Conda' section of the Spark documentation. This modification is intended to resolve the 404 error that occurs when the current URL with the trailing slash is accessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is necessary because the existing URL with a trailing slash leads to a 404 error, hindering users' access to the Conda cheat sheet. Removing the slash will ensure the link directs users to the correct webpage, improving the documentation's usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This change only affects the documentation and does not alter the functionality of the Spark software itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis documentation fix was visually inspected to ensure the corrected URL resolves to the intended webpage without a 404 error. No additional code testing is necessary as this change is strictly within the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-11T06:59:32Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T07:00:55Z","closed_at":"2023-11-11T07:00:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a30808c10f4718ffad1afd7674bcfb73646707e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db4457843c9168ddbdfe5675725bb05b192949f9","head":{"label":"wonseokyang-de:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"db4457843c9168ddbdfe5675725bb05b192949f9","user":{"login":"wonseokyang-de","id":62360849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzYwODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62360849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de","html_url":"https://github.com/wonseokyang-de","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wonseokyang-de/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b501a223bfcf4ddbcb0b2447aa06c549051630b0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an correctness issue while enabling AQE for SQL Cache. This issue was caused by AQE coalescing the top-level shuffle in the physical plan of InMemoryTableScan and wrongfully reported the output partitioning of that InMemoryTableScan as HashPartitioning as if it had not been coalesced. The caller query of that InMemoryTableScan in turn failed to align the partitions correctly and output incorrect join results.\r\n\r\nThe fix addresses the issue by disabling coalescing in InMemoryTableScan for shuffles in the final stage. This fix also guarantees that AQE enabled for SQL cache vs. disabled would always be a performance win, since AQE optimizations are applied to all non-top-level stages and meanwhile no extra shuffle would be introduced between the parent query and the cached relation (if coalescing in top-level shuffles of InMemoryTableScan was not disabled, an extra shuffle would end up being added on top of the cached relation when the cache is used in a join query and the partition key matches the join key in order to avoid the correctness issue).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix correctness issue and to avoid potential AQE perf regressions in queries using SQL cache.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the implementation of interpretation mode, and make it consistent to codegen. Both implementation raise the same error with new error class `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.CHARSET`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make codegen and non-codegen of the `Encode` expression consistent. So, users will observe the same behaviour in both modes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user code depends on error from `encode()`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the following test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z string-functions.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to include all available stack traces in DataFrame context to the `callSite` field and apparently to the `summary`. For now, DataFrame context contains only one item of stack trace, but later we'll add a config to control the number of items in stack traces (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43695).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL while debugging some issue. Users can see all available stack trace, and see from where the issue comes in user code from.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, should not. Even if user's code parses the summary.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryContextSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-10T10:50:58Z","updated_at":"2023-11-12T22:28:51Z","closed_at":"2023-11-12T22:28:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea0d8bd146126c909727ac391b77ebb2aa8710aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9a3ee4c9a153cb87423cdd7590fff333a23ed1c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:output-stack-trace","ref":"output-stack-trace","sha":"d9a3ee4c9a153cb87423cdd7590fff333a23ed1c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport multiple retry policies defined at the same time. Each policy determines which error types it can retry and how exactly those should be spread out.\r\n\r\nScala parity for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43591\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDifferent error types should be treated differently For instance, networking connectivity errors and remote resources being initialized should be treated separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo (as long as user doesn't poke within client internals).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, some hand testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-10T10:46:37Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T10:41:45Z","closed_at":"2023-11-16T10:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"822da81a3d7025cdcde8593fbf0c1d5e55d1b49f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7e20d0b5272a228c49d3a5e04b79fa4db76cd21","head":{"label":"cdkrot:SPARK-45851-scala-multiple-policies","ref":"SPARK-45851-scala-multiple-policies","sha":"d7e20d0b5272a228c49d3a5e04b79fa4db76cd21","user":{"login":"cdkrot","id":5040764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDA3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5040764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot","html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659205820,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ0quvA","name":"apache_spark","full_name":"cdkrot/apache_spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cdkrot","id":5040764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDA3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5040764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot","html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdkrot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cdkrot/apache_spark","description":"Apache
