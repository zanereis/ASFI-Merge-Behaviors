Interpreted expression evaluation is used when codegen was not able to work, for example complex schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we only do subexpression elimination for codegen. For some reasons, we may need to run interpreted expression evaluation. For example, codegen fails to compile and fallbacks to interpreted mode, or complex input/output schema of expressions. It is commonly seen for complex schema from expressions that is possibly caused by the query optimizer too, e.g. SPARK-32945.\r\n\r\nWe should also support subexpression elimination for interpreted evaluation. That could reduce performance difference when Spark fallbacks from codegen to interpreted expression evaluation, and improve Spark usability.\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark\r\n\r\nUpdate `SubExprEliminationBenchmark`:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_265-b01 on Mac OS X 10.15.6\r\n Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n from_json as subExpr:                      Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsubexpressionElimination on, codegen off           24707          25688         903          0.0   247068775.9       1.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_265-b01 on Mac OS X 10.15.6\r\n Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n from_json as subExpr:                      Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nsubexpressionElimination on, codegen off            2360           2435          87          0.0    23604320.7      11.2X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

#30303 to 3.0**\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following query produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nSELECT date_trunc('minute', '1769-10-17 17:10:02')\r\n```\r\nSpark currently incorrectly returns\r\n```\r\n1769-10-17 17:10:02\r\n```\r\nagainst the expected return value of\r\n```\r\n1769-10-17 17:10:00\r\n```\r\n**Steps to repro** \r\nRun the following commands in spark-shell:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT date_trunc('minute', '1769-10-17 17:10:02')\").show()\r\n```\r\nThis happens as `truncTimestamp` in package `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtils` incorrectly assumes that time zone offsets can never have the granularity of a second and thus does not account for time zone adjustment when truncating the given timestamp to `minute`. \r\nThis assumption is currently used when truncating the timestamps to `microsecond, millisecond, second, or minute`. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue and always uses time zone knowledge when truncating timestamps regardless of the truncation unit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite` which previously failed and pass now.","created_at":"2020-11-11T18:12:52Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T23:08:24Z","closed_at":"2020-11-11T22:46:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58e256c0d28684bd9d76ae7b6ba02abb151ce64f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d7ebab955e16f486b8925402b27d8f0f5a62c5a","head":{"label":"utkarsh39:date_trunc_fix_3.0","ref":"date_trunc_fix_3.0","sha":"3d7ebab955e16f486b8925402b27d8f0f5a62c5a","user":{"login":"utkarsh39","id":10495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk1MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311491719,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTE0OTE3MTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"utkarsh39/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"utkarsh39","id":10495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk1MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39/spark","description":"Apache

In it the ignoreTimeZone method will judge CastBase. If it does not need timeZone, timeZone will be forced to be removed。\r\n```\r\nobject Canonicalize extends Logging{\r\n    def execute(e: Expression): Expression = {\r\n      expressionReorder(ignoreTimeZone(ignoreNamesTypes(e)))\r\n    }\r\n    private[expressions] def ignoreTimeZone(e: Expression): Expression = e match {\r\n    case c: CastBase if c.timeZoneId.nonEmpty && !c.needsTimeZone =>\r\n      logDebug(s\"e:${e} ignoreTimeZone\")\r\n      c.withTimeZone(null)\r\n    case _ => e\r\n  }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2.The CastBase#needsTimeZone method will call the Cast#needsTimeZone method to judge,\r\n```\r\n  def needsTimeZone(from: DataType, to: DataType): Boolean = (from, to) match {\r\n            case (StringType, TimestampType | DateType) => true\r\n            case (DateType, TimestampType) => true\r\n            case (TimestampType, StringType) => true\r\n            case (TimestampType, DateType) => true\r\n            case (ArrayType(fromType, _), ArrayType(toType, _)) => needsTimeZone(fromType, toType)\r\n            case (MapType(fromKey, fromValue, _), MapType(toKey, toValue, _)) =>\r\n              needsTimeZone(fromKey, toKey) || needsTimeZone(fromValue, toValue)\r\n            case (StructType(fromFields), StructType(toFields)) =>\r\n              fromFields.length == toFields.length &&\r\n                fromFields.zip(toFields).exists {\r\n                  case (fromField, toField) =>\r\n                    needsTimeZone(fromField.dataType, toField.dataType)\r\n                }\r\n            case _ => false\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can be seen here that if from DateType to StringType, the judgment result is false, indicating that cast(DateTyte as String) does not require Timezone\r\n\r\n\r\n3. But the conversion from Datetype to String in Cast requires Timezone, as following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabstract class CastBase extends UnaryExpression with TimeZoneAwareExpression with NullIntolerant {\r\n        private lazy val dateFormatter = DateFormatter(zoneId)\r\n\r\n        private[this] def cast(from: DataType, to: DataType): Any => Any = {\r\n            if (DataType.equalsStructurally(from, to)) {\r\n              identity\r\n            } else if (from == NullType) {\r\n              _ => throw new SparkException(s\"should not directly cast from NullType to $to.\")\r\n            } else {\r\n              to match {\r\n                case dt if dt == from => identity[Any]\r\n                case StringType => castToString(from)\r\n                case BinaryType => castToBinary(from)\r\n                case DateType => castToDate(from)\r\n                case decimal: DecimalType => castToDecimal(from, decimal)\r\n                case TimestampType => castToTimestamp(from)\r\n                case CalendarIntervalType => castToInterval(from)\r\n                case BooleanType => castToBoolean(from)\r\n                case ByteType => castToByte(from)\r\n                case ShortType => castToShort(from)\r\n                case IntegerType => castToInt(from)\r\n                case FloatType => castToFloat(from)\r\n                case LongType => castToLong(from)\r\n                case DoubleType => castToDouble(from)\r\n                case array: ArrayType =>\r\n                  castArray(from.asInstanceOf[ArrayType].elementType, array.elementType)\r\n                case map: MapType => castMap(from.asInstanceOf[MapType], map)\r\n                case struct: StructType => castStruct(from.asInstanceOf[StructType], struct)\r\n                case udt: UserDefinedType[_]\r\n                  if udt.userClass == from.asInstanceOf[UserDefinedType[_]].userClass =>\r\n                  identity[Any]\r\n                case _: UserDefinedType[_] =>\r\n                  throw new SparkException(s\"Cannot cast $from to $to.\")\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            private[this] def castToString(from: DataType): Any => Any = from match {\r\n              case CalendarIntervalType =>\r\n                buildCast[CalendarInterval](_, i => UTF8String.fromString(i.toString))\r\n              case BinaryType => buildCast[Array[Byte]](_, UTF8String.fromBytes)\r\n              case DateType => buildCast[Int](_, d => UTF8String.fromString(dateFormatter.format(d)))\r\n              case TimestampType => buildCast[Long](_,\r\n                t => UTF8String.fromString(DateTimeUtils.timestampToString(timestampFormatter, t)))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n trait TimeZoneAwareExpression extends Expression {\r\n          def timeZoneId: Option[String]\r\n          def withTimeZone(timeZoneId: String): TimeZoneAwareExpression\r\n\r\n          @transient lazy val zoneId: ZoneId = DateTimeUtils.getZoneId(timeZoneId.get)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n4. So we should add judge in Cast#needsTimeZone as following:\r\n```\r\ndef needsTimeZone(from: DataType, to: DataType): Boolean = (from, to) match {\r\n            case (StringType, TimestampType | DateType) => true\r\n            case (DateType, TimestampType) => true\r\n            case (DateType, StringType) => true\r\n            case (TimestampType, StringType) => true\r\n            case (TimestampType, DateType) => true\r\n            case (ArrayType(fromType, _), ArrayType(toType, _)) => needsTimeZone(fromType, toType)\r\n            case (MapType(fromKey, fromValue, _), MapType(toKey, toValue, _)) =>\r\n              needsTimeZone(fromKey, toKey) || needsTimeZone(fromValue, toValue)\r\n            case (StructType(fromFields), StructType(toFields)) =>\r\n              fromFields.length == toFields.length &&\r\n                fromFields.zip(toFields).exists {\r\n                  case (fromField, toField) =>\r\n                    needsTimeZone(fromField.dataType, toField.dataType)\r\n                }\r\n            case _ => false\r\n          }\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

`or` expressions when pruning Hive partitions. That will cause Hive metastore stack over flow if there are a lot of values.\r\n\r\nThis pr rewrite `InSet` predicate to `GreaterThanOrEqual` min value and `LessThanOrEqual ` max value when pruning Hive partitions to avoid Hive metastore stack overflow.\r\n\r\nFrom our experience, `spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruningInSetThreshold` should be less than 10000.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix the behaviour of query filters in `TPCDSQueryBenchmark`. We can use an option `--query-filter` for selecting TPCDS queries to run, e.g., `--query-filter q6,q8,q13`. But, the current master has a weird behaviour about the option. For example, if we pass `--query-filter q6` so as to run the TPCDS q6 only, `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` runs `q6` and `q6-v2.7` because the `filterQueries` method does not respect the name suffix. So, there is no way now to run the TPCDS q6 only. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `SHOW CREATE TABLE` works only with a v1 table and a permanent view, and not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes allow consistent resolution behavior when resolving the table identifier. For example, the following is the current behavior:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 1\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE db\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t (key INT, value STRING) USING hive\")\r\nsql(\"USE db\")\r\nsql(\"SHOW CREATE TABLE t AS SERDE\") // Succeeds\r\n```\r\nWith this change, `SHOW CREATE TABLE ... AS SERDE` above fails with the following:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view not table or permanent view.; line 1 pos 0\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.$anonfun$applyOrElse$43(Analyzer.scala:883)\r\n  at scala.Option.map(Option.scala:230)\r\n```\r\n, which is expected since temporary view is resolved first and `SHOW CREATE TABLE ... AS SERDE` doesn't support a temporary view.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no behavior change for `SHOW CREATE TABLE` without `AS SERDE` since it was already resolving to a temporary view first. See below for more detail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `SHOW CREATE TABLE t AS SERDE` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of table `db.t` in the above scenario.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no behavior change for `SHOW CREATE TABLE` without `AS SERDE`, but the exception message changes from `SHOW CREATE TABLE is not supported on a temporary view` to `t is a temp view not table or permanent view`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Applies the SQL changes in SPARK-33230 to SparkHadoopWriter, so that `rdd.saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` passes in a unique job UUID in `spark.sql.sources.writeJobUUID`\r\n1. `SparkHadoopWriterUtils.createJobTrackerID` generates a JobID by appending a random long number to the supplied timestamp to ensure the probability of a collision is near-zero.\r\n1. With tests of uniqueness, round trips and negative jobID rejection.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this, if more than one job is started in the same second *and the committer expects application attempt IDs to be unique* is at risk of clashing with other jobs.\r\n\r\nWith the fix,\r\n\r\n* those committers which use the ID set in `spark.sql.sources.writeJobUUID` as a priority ID will pick that up instead and so be unique.\r\n* committers which use the Hadoop JobID for unique paths and filenames will get the randomly generated jobID.  Assuming all clocks in a cluster in sync, the probability of two jobs launched in the same second has dropped from 1 to 1/(2^63)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\nThere's a new test suite SparkHadoopWriterUtilsSuite which creates jobID, verifies they are unique even for the same timestamp and that they can be marshalled to string and parsed back in the hadoop code, which contains some (brittle) assumptions about the format of job IDs.\r\n\r\nFunctional Integration Tests\r\n\r\n1. Hadoop-trunk built with [HADOOP-17318], publishing to local maven repository\r\n1. Spark built with hadoop.version=3.4.0-SNAPSHOT to pick up these JARs.\r\n1. Spark + Object store integration tests at [https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration](https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration) were built against that local spark version\r\n1. And executed against AWS london.\r\n\r\nThe tests were run with `fs.s3a.committer.require.uuid=true`, so the s3a committers fail fast if they don't get a job ID down. This showed that `rdd.saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` wasn't setting the UUID option. It again uses the current Date value for an app attempt -which is not guaranteed to be unique.\r\n\r\nWith the change applied to spark, the relevant tests work, therefore the committers are getting unique job

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake a special case in `ResolveReferences`, which resolves `OverwriteByExpression`'s condition expression based on the table relation instead of the input query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe condition expression is passed to the table implementation at the end, so we should resolve it using table schema. Previously it works because we have a hack in `ResolveReferences` to delay the resolution if `outputResolved == false`. However, this hack doesn't work for tables accepting any schema like https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/521 . We may wrongly resolve the delete condition using input query's outout columns which don't match the table column names.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests and updated test in v2

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBroadcastNestedLoopJoin does not support cancel. It will continue to run until the end of the loop even if the job is killed. And some checks to support real job cancel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMost of the spark tasks support cancel, we have many checks in iterator. But broadcastNestedLoopJoin does not support cancel and usually this kind of join is very slow, so we need to interrupt it after we kill the job\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nSimple change. Test it in local environment and a TaskKilledException is raised after the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for Converting Java Enums on CatalystTypeConverters.  This is a backport to 2.4.X branch of the changes introduced in #30236\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33330\r\n\r\nGiven that:\r\n\r\nJavaTypeInference maps [Enums to StringType ](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/JavaTypeInference.scala#L135)\r\nThe converter for [StringType is StringConverter](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/CatalystTypeConverters.scala#L64)\r\nStringConverter is [unable to convert an Enums to UTF8String](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/55105a0784459331d5506eee9f37c2e655a2a6a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/CatalystTypeConverters.scala#L294), failing with an InvalidArgumentException\r\n \r\n\r\nIt can be argued that CatalystTypeConverters should align with the exprectations set by JavaTypeInference and convert enums to their string representation. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n~~No~~  Yes. Adds support for Java enum handling. Project to demonstrate the bug here https://github.com/malduarte/testEnum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded  \"convert Enum to String\" test on

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the shuffle writer side change where executors can push data to remote shuffle services. This is needed for push-based shuffle - SPIP [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n- This adds support for executors to push shuffle blocks after map tasks complete writing shuffle data.\r\n- This also introduces a timeout specifically for creating connection to remote shuffle services. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- These changes are needed for push-based shuffle. Refer to the SPIP in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\n- The main reason to create a separate connection creation timeout is because the existing `connectionTimeoutMs` is overloaded and is used for connection creation timeouts as well as connection idle timeout. The connection creation timeout should be much lower than the idle timeouts. The default for `connectionTimeoutMs` is 120s. This is quite high for just establishing the connections.  If a shuffle server node is bad then the connection creation will fail within few seconds. However, an overloaded shuffle server may take much longer to respond to a request and the channel can stay idle for a much longer time which is expected.  Another reason is that with push-based shuffle, an executor may be fetching shuffle data and pushing shuffle data (next stage) simultaneously. Both these tasks will share the same connections with the shuffle service. If there is a bad shuffle server node and the connection creation timeout is very high then both these tasks end up waiting a long time time eventually impacting the performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR introduces client-side configs for push-based shuffle. If push-based shuffle is turned-off then the users will not see any change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\nThe reference PR with the consolidated changes covering the complete implementation is also provided in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\nWe have already verified the functionality and the improved performance as documented in the SPIP doc.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen mshen@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Chandni Singh chsingh@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Ye Zhou

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to simplify the exception messages from Python UDFS. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the exception message from Python UDFs is as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf; spark.range(10).select(udf(lambda x: x/0)(\"id\")).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

f(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <lambda>\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, almost all cases, users only care about `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`. We don't really have to show the internal stuff in 99% cases. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a configuration `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.simplifiedException.enabled` (disabled by default) that hides the internal tracebacks related to Python worker, (de)serialization, etc.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/.../python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 427, in show\r\n    print(self._jdf.showString(n, 20, vertical))\r\n  File \"/.../python/lib/py4j-0.10.9-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1305, in __call__\r\n  File \"/.../python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 127, in deco\r\n    raise_from(converted)\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 3, in raise_from\r\npyspark.sql.utils.PythonException:\r\n  An exception was thrown from Python worker in the executor:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <lambda>\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trackback will be shown from the point when any non-PySpark file is seen in the traceback.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this configuration. such internal tracebacks are exposed to users directly especially for shall or notebook users in PySpark. 99% cases people don't care about the internal Python worker, (de)serialization and related tracebacks. It just makes the exception more difficult to read. For example, one statement of `x/0` above shows a very long traceback and most of them are unnecessary. \r\n\r\nThis configuration enables the ability to show simplified tracebacks which users will likely be most interested in.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nBy default, no. It adds one configuration that simplifies the exception message. See the example above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pyspark --conf spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.simplifiedException.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf; spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"FATAL\"); spark.range(10).select(udf(lambda x: x/0)(\"id\")).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nand unittests were also added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-10T05:17:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:24Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T05:15:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e73e73f505c65db51f3cbd3db92d59995e0f16ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f04af73fab996ce619aea1372e5a00fc405b181","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33407","ref":"SPARK-33407","sha":"0f04af73fab996ce619aea1372e5a00fc405b181","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nApache Arrow 2.0.0 was released with some improvements from Java side, so it's better to upgrade Spark to the new version.\r\nNote that the format version in Arrow 2.0.0 is still 1.0.0 so API should still be compatible between 1.0.1 and 2.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following query produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nSELECT date_trunc('minute', '1769-10-17 17:10:02')\r\n```\r\nSpark currently incorrectly returns\r\n```\r\n1769-10-17 17:10:02\r\n```\r\nagainst the expected return value of\r\n```\r\n1769-10-17 17:10:00\r\n```\r\n**Steps to repro** \r\nRun the following commands in spark-shell:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT date_trunc('minute', '1769-10-17 17:10:02')\").show()\r\n```\r\nThis happens as `truncTimestamp` in package `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtils` incorrectly assumes that time zone offsets can never have the granularity of a second and thus does not account for time zone adjustment when truncating the given timestamp to `minute`. \r\nThis assumption is currently used when truncating the timestamps to `microsecond, millisecond, second, or minute`. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue and always uses time zone knowledge when truncating timestamps regardless of the truncation unit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite` which previously failed and pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request tries to normalize the SortOrder properly to prevent unnecessary sort operators. Currently the sameOrderExpressions are not normalized as part of AliasAwareOutputOrdering.\r\n\r\nExample: consider this join of three tables:\r\n\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n        |SELECT t2id, t3.id as t3id\r\n        |FROM (\r\n        |    SELECT t1.id as t1id, t2.id as t2id\r\n        |    FROM t1, t2\r\n        |    WHERE t1.id = t2.id\r\n        |) t12, t3\r\n        |WHERE t1id = t3.id\r\n      \"\"\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan for this looks like:\r\n\r\n      *(8) Project [t2id#1059L, id#1004L AS t3id#1060L]\r\n      +- *(8) SortMergeJoin [t2id#1059L], [id#1004L], Inner\r\n         :- *(5) Sort [t2id#1059L ASC NULLS FIRST ], false, 0         <-----------------------------\r\n         :  +- *(5) Project [id#1000L AS t2id#1059L]\r\n         :     +- *(5) SortMergeJoin [id#996L], [id#1000L], Inner\r\n         :        :- *(2) Sort [id#996L ASC NULLS FIRST ], false, 0\r\n         :        :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#996L, 5), true, [id=#1426]\r\n         :        :     +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         :        +- *(4) Sort [id#1000L ASC NULLS FIRST ], false, 0\r\n         :           +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#1000L, 5), true, [id=#1432]\r\n         :              +- *(3) Range (0, 20, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         +- *(7) Sort [id#1004L ASC NULLS FIRST ], false, 0\r\n            +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#1004L, 5), true, [id=#1443]\r\n               +- *(6) Range (0, 30, step=1, splits=2)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this plan, the marked sort node could have been avoided as the data is already sorted on \"t2.id\" by the lower SortMergeJoin.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo remove unneeded Sort operators.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify SparkSQLCLIDriver.scala to move ahead calling the cli.printMasterAndAppId method before process file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEven though in SPARK-25043 it has already brought in the printing application id feature. But the process file situation seems have not been included. This small change is to make spark-sql will also print out application id when process file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request tries to remove unneeded exchanges/sorts by normalizing the output partitioning and sortorder information correctly with respect to aliases.\r\n\r\nExample: consider this join of three tables:\r\n\r\n     |SELECT t2id, t3.id as t3id\r\n     |FROM (\r\n     |    SELECT t1.id as t1id, t2.id as t2id\r\n     |    FROM t1, t2\r\n     |    WHERE t1.id = t2.id\r\n     |) t12, t3\r\n     |WHERE t1id = t3.id\r\n\r\nThe plan for this looks like:\r\n\r\n      *(9) Project [t2id#1034L, id#1004L AS t3id#1035L]\r\n      +- *(9) SortMergeJoin [t1id#1033L], [id#1004L], Inner\r\n         :- *(6) Sort [t1id#1033L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n         :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(t1id#1033L, 5), true, [id=#1343]   <------------------------------\r\n         :     +- *(5) Project [id#996L AS t1id#1033L, id#1000L AS t2id#1034L]\r\n         :        +- *(5) SortMergeJoin [id#996L], [id#1000L], Inner\r\n         :           :- *(2) Sort [id#996L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n         :           :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#996L, 5), true, [id=#1329]\r\n         :           :     +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         :           +- *(4) Sort [id#1000L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n         :              +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#1000L, 5), true, [id=#1335]\r\n         :                 +- *(3) Range (0, 20, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         +- *(8) Sort [id#1004L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n            +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#1004L, 5), true, [id=#1349]\r\n               +- *(7) Range (0, 30, step=1, splits=2)\r\n\r\nIn this plan, the marked exchange could have been avoided as the data is already partitioned on \"t1.id\". This happens because AliasAwareOutputPartitioning class handles aliases only related to HashPartitioning. This change normalizes all output partitioning based on aliasing happening in Project.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo remove unneeded exchanges.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT added.\r\n\r\nOn TPCDS 1000 scale, this change improves the performance of query 95 from 330 seconds to 170 seconds by removing the extra

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes CreateViewCommand/AlterViewAsCommand capturing runtime SQL configs and store them as view properties. These configs will be applied during the parsing and analysis phases of the view resolution. Users can set `spark.sql.legacy.useCurrentConfigsForView` to `true` to restore the behavior before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR is a sub-task of [SPARK-33138](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33138) that proposes to unify temp view and permanent view behaviors. This PR makes permanent views mimicking the temp view behavior that \"fixes\" view semantic by directly storing resolved LogicalPlan. For example, if a user uses spark 2.4 to create a view that contains null values from division-by-zero expressions, she may not want that other users' queries which reference her view throw exceptions when running on spark 3.x with ansi mode on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT + existing UTs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30277\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix PySpark to officially support Python 3.9. The main codes already work. We should just note that we support Python 3.9.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes some minor fixes into the test codes.\r\n- `Thread.isAlive` is removed in Python 3.9, and `Thread.is_alive` exists in Python 3.6+, see https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html#removed\r\n- Fixed `TaskContextTestsWithWorkerReuse.test_barrier_with_python_worker_reuse` and `TaskContextTests.test_barrier` to be less flaky. This becomes more flaky in Python 3.9 for some reasons.\r\n\r\nNOTE that PyArrow does not support Python 3.9 yet.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo officially support Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it officially supports Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$  ./run-tests --python-executable=python\r\nRunning PySpark tests. Output is in /.../spark/python/unit-tests.log\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-core', 'pyspark-ml', 'pyspark-mllib', 'pyspark-resource', 'pyspark-sql', 'pyspark-streaming']\r\npython python_implementation is CPython\r\npython version is: Python 3.9.0\r\nStarting test(python):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to gather common `SHOW TABLES` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.ShowTablesSuite`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.ShowTablesSuite` and `v2.ShowTablesSuite`. Also tests for parsing `SHOW TABLES` are extracted to `ShowTablesParserSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The unification will allow to run common `SHOW TABLES` tests for both DSv1 and DSv2\r\n- We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suites:\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.v1.ShowTablesSuite`\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.v2.ShowTablesSuite`\r\n- `ShowTablesParserSuite`","created_at":"2020-11-07T18:40:45Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:30Z","closed_at":"2020-11-11T05:27:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1a973e38505a7922f3e4cc17355e907c34327d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8108cb1b5879b7873e3bfa43058ec3db7feba148","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:unify-dsv1_v2-tests","ref":"unify-dsv1_v2-tests","sha":"8108cb1b5879b7873e3bfa43058ec3db7feba148","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis removes the `sharesHadoopClasses` flag from `IsolatedClientLoader` in Hive module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, when initializing `IsolatedClientLoader`, users can set the `sharesHadoopClasses` flag to decide whether the `HiveClient` created should share Hadoop classes with Spark itself or not. In the latter case, the client will only load Hadoop classes from the Hive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons to remove this:\r\n1. this feature is currently used in two cases: 1) unit tests, 2) when the Hadoop version defined in Maven can not be found when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is equal to \"maven\", which could be very rare.\r\n2. when `sharesHadoopClasses` is false, Spark doesn't really only use Hadoop classes from Hive jars: we also download `hadoop-client` jar and put all the sub-module jars (e.g., `hadoop-common`, `hadoop-hdfs`) together with the Hive jars, and the Hadoop version used by `hadoop-client` is the same version used by Spark itself. As result, we're mixing two versions of Hadoop jars in the classpath, which could potentially cause issues, especially considering that the default Hadoop version is already 3.2.0 while most Hive versions supported by the `IsolatedClientLoader` is still using Hadoop 2.x or even lower.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis affects Spark users in one scenario: when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` is set to `maven` AND the Hadoop version specified in pom file cannot be downloaded, currently the behavior is to switch to _not_ share Hadoop classes, but with the PR it will share Hadoop classes with Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config spark.yarn.pyspark.archives to provide location of pyspark.zip and py4j.zip.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. If I have different version of `spark.yarn.archive` from current machine, then there is no way to provide matched pyspark version. This happens in version upgrade.\r\n2. This can save effort of uploading pyspark.zip and py4j.zip every time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Added in yarn doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-06T19:56:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T16:19:50Z","closed_at":"2020-11-10T16:19:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86866d35c050ec18aabebfb4a82b7308e47d65c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/545dab707de0138d216f812ef4eaa9925de4c573","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:33375","ref":"33375","sha":"545dab707de0138d216f812ef4eaa9925de4c573","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix PySpark to officially support Python 3.9. The main codes already work. We should just note that we support Python 3.9.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes some minor fixes into the test codes.\r\n- `Thread.isAlive` is removed in Python 3.9, and `Thread.is_alive` exists in Python 3.6+, see https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html#removed\r\n- Fixed `TaskContextTestsWithWorkerReuse.test_barrier_with_python_worker_reuse` and `TaskContextTests.test_barrier` to be less flaky. This becomes more flaky in Python 3.9 for some reasons.\r\n\r\nNOTE that PyArrow does not support Python 3.9 yet.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo officially support Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it officially supports Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$  ./run-tests --python-executable=python\r\nRunning PySpark tests.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen TableProvider.supportsExternalMetadata() is true, Spark will use the input Dataframe's schema in `DataframeWriter.save()`/`DataStreamWriter.start()` and skip schema/partitioning inference.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor all the v2 data sources which are not FileDataSourceV2, Spark always infers the table schema/partitioning on `DataframeWriter.save()`/`DataStreamWriter.start()`.\r\nThe inference of table schema/partitioning can be expensive. However, there is no such trait or flag for indicating a V2 source can use the input DataFrame's schema on `DataframeWriter.save()`/`DataStreamWriter.start()`. We can resolve the problem by adding a new expected behavior for the method `TableProvider.supportsExternalMetadata()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new behavior for the data source v2 API `TableProvider.supportsExternalMetadata()` when it returns true.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `LOAD DATA` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `LOAD DATA` is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes allow consistent resolution behavior when resolving the table identifier. For example, the following is the current behavior:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 1\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE db\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t (key INT, value STRING) USING hive\")\r\nsql(\"USE db\")\r\nsql(\"LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'examples/src/main/resources/kv1.txt' INTO TABLE t\") // Succeeds\r\n```\r\nWith this change, `LOAD DATA` above fails with the following:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view not table.; line 1 pos 0\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer$ResolveTempViews$$anonfun$apply$7.$anonfun$applyOrElse$39(Analyzer.scala:865)\r\n    at scala.Option.foreach(Option.scala:407)\r\n```\r\n, which is expected since temporary view is resolved first and `LOAD DATA` doesn't support a temporary view.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `LOAD DATA ... t` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of table `db.t` in the above scenario.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

current implementation of the `DAGScheduler` exhibits exponential runtime in DAGs with many `PartitionerAwareUnions`. The reason seems to be a mutual recursion between\r\n`PartitionerAwareUnion.getPreferredLocations` and `DAGScheduler.getPreferredLocs`.\r\n\r\nA minimal example reproducing the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject Example extends App {\r\n  val partitioner = new HashPartitioner(2)\r\n  val sc = new SparkContext(new SparkConf().setAppName(\"\").setMaster(\"local[*]\"))\r\n  val rdd1 = sc.emptyRDD[(Int, Int)].partitionBy(partitioner)\r\n  val rdd2 = (1 to 30).map(_ => rdd1)\r\n  val rdd3 = rdd2.reduce(_ union _)\r\n  rdd3.collect()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe whole app should take around one second to complete, as no actual work is done. However,  it takes more time to submit the job than I am willing to wait. \r\n\r\nThe underlying cause appears to be mutual recursion between `PartitionerAwareUnion.getPreferredLocations` and `DAGScheduler.getPreferredLocs`, which restarts graph traversal at each `PartitionerAwareUnion` with no memoization. Each node of the DAG is visited `O(n!)` (exponentially many) times.\r\n\r\nIn the pull-request I propose to call rdd.getPreferredLocations instead of DAGScheduler.getPreferredLocs inside PartitionerAwareUnion.","created_at":"2020-11-05T09:53:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T00:44:47Z","closed_at":"2021-02-15T00:44:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6eee496d43aa246d6e369374c9d40fcbb883383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/04fab75377b7d9c37a69a2223406615480e79700","head":{"label":"lucasbru:fixpaunion","ref":"fixpaunion","sha":"04fab75377b7d9c37a69a2223406615480e79700","user":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":310254763,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTAyNTQ3NjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"lucasbru/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn section 6.13 of the ANSI SQL standard, there are syntax rules for valid combinations of the source and target data types.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/98212874-17356f80-1ef9-11eb-8f2b-385f32db404a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing the ANSI CAST syntax rules with the current default behavior of Spark:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/98789831-b7870a80-23b7-11eb-9b5f-469a42e0ee4a.png)\r\n\r\nTo make Spark's ANSI mode more ANSI SQL Compatible，I propose to disallow the following casting in ANSI mode:\r\n```\r\nTimeStamp <=> Boolean\r\nDate <=> Boolean\r\nNumeric <=> Timestamp\r\nNumeric <=> Date\r\nNumeric <=> Binary\r\nString <=> Array\r\nString <=> Map\r\nString <=> Struct\r\n```\r\nThe following castings are considered invalid in ANSI SQL standard, but they are quite straight forward. Let's Allow them for now\r\n```\r\nNumeric <=> Boolean\r\nString <=> Binary\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBetter ANSI SQL compliance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the following castings will not be allowed in ANSI mode:\r\n```\r\nTimeStamp <=> Boolean\r\nDate <=> Boolean\r\nNumeric <=> Timestamp\r\nNumeric <=> Date\r\nNumeric <=> Binary\r\nString <=> Array\r\nString <=> Map\r\nString <=> Struct\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are two similar compilation warnings about procedure-like declaration in Scala 2.13:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] [Warn] /spark/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/HeartbeatReceiver.scala:70: procedure syntax is deprecated for constructors: add `=`, as in method definition\r\n```\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] [Warn] /spark/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManagerDecommissioner.scala:211: procedure syntax is deprecated: instead, add `: Unit =` to explicitly declare `run`'s return type\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis pr is the first part to resolve SPARK-33352：\r\n\r\n- For constructors method definition add `=` to convert to function syntax\r\n\r\n- For without `return type` methods definition add `: Unit =` to convert to function syntax\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEliminate compilation warnings in Scala 2.13 and this change should be compatible with Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30059 .\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `pre-built image` at Github Action PySpark jobs. To isolate the changes, `pyspark` jobs are split from the main job. The docker image is built by the following.\r\n\r\n| Item                   | URL                |\r\n| --------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Dockerfile         | https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/ApacheSparkGitHubActionImage/blob/main/Dockerfile |\r\n| Builder               | https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/ApacheSparkGitHubActionImage/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml |\r\n| Image Location | https://hub.docker.com/r/dongjoon/apache-spark-github-action-image |\r\n\r\nPlease note that.\r\n1. The community still will use `build_and_test.yml` to add new features like as we did until now. The `Dockerfile` will be updated regularly.\r\n2. When Apache Spark gets an official docker repository location, we will use it.\r\n3. Also, it's the best if we keep this docker file and builder script at a new Apache Spark dev branch instead of outside GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will reduce the Python and its package installation time.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE (branch-3.0)**\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-04 at 2 28 49

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate join type in stream static joins code examples in structured streaming programming guide.\r\n1) Scala, Java and Python examples have a common issue.\r\n    The join keyword is \"right_join\", it should be \"left_outer\".\r\n\r\n    _Reasons:_\r\n    a) This code snippet is an example of \"left outer join\" as the streaming df is on left and static df is on right. Also, right outer    join between stream df(left) and static df(right) is not supported.\r\n    b) The keyword \"right_join/left_join\" is unsupported and it should be \"right_outer/left_outer\".\r\n\r\nSo, all of these code snippets have been updated to \"left_outer\".\r\n\r\n2) R exmaple is correct, but the example is of \"right_outer\" with static df (left) and streaming df(right). \r\nIt is changed to \"left_outer\" to make it consistent with other three examples of scala, java and python.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the mistake in example code of documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it is a user-facing change (but documentation update only).\r\n\r\n**Screenshots 1:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a system.exit exception occurs during the process, the python worker exits abnormally, and then the executor task is still waiting for the worker for reading from socket, causing it to hang.\r\nThe system.exit exception may be caused by the user's error code, but spark should at least throw an error to remind the user, not get stuck\r\nwe can run a simple test to reproduce this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\ndef err(line):\r\n  raise SystemExit\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"test\").getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sparkContext.parallelize(range(1,2), 2).map(err).collect()\r\nspark.stop()\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nto make sure pyspark application won't hang if there's non-Exception error in python worker\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded a new test and also manually tested the case above","created_at":"2020-11-04T11:29:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T07:38:50Z","closed_at":"2020-11-10T10:39:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1f392cf7b43388efac3491ba56ceaca2536a668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5c33f0b28e58110de04e9dbc6e1d75bc59d53f0","head":{"label":"li36909:pyspark","ref":"pyspark","sha":"e5c33f0b28e58110de04e9dbc6e1d75bc59d53f0","user":{"login":"li36909","id":3632162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909","html_url":"https://github.com/li36909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114751824,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ3NTE4MjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"li36909/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"li36909","id":3632162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909","html_url":"https://github.com/li36909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li36909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/li36909/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently we skip subexpression elimination in branches of conditional expressions including `If`, `CaseWhen`, and `Coalesce`. Actually we can do subexpression elimination for such branches if the subexpression is common across all branches. This patch proposes to support subexpression elimination in branches of conditional expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe may miss subexpression elimination chances in branches of conditional expressions. This kind of subexpression is frequently seen. It may be written manually by users or come from query optimizer. For example, project collapsing could embed expressions between two `Project`s and produces conditional expression like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCASE WHEN jsonToStruct(json).a = '1' THEN 1.0 WHEN jsonToStruct(json).a = '2' THEN 2.0 ... ELSE 1.2 END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `jsonToStruct(json)` is time-expensive expression, we don't eliminate the duplication and waste time on running it repeatedly now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit
