NOTES\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two commits. The first one 3dc909d is mandatory.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd one 8ec8a25 improves 'disable directory listing' scenario. Before this commit, if directory listing was disabled and parent directory was not found, FetchSFTP did not try creating the missing parent directories. The 2nd commit made the processor to create parent directories. It affects to PutSFTP, too.\r\n\r\nI didn't create another JIRA for the 2nd commit, since these can be tested and reviewed easier at the same time. Please let me know if you, reviewer think it should be managed separately.\r\n\r\nI used following docker images for testing:\r\n- atmoz/sftp\r\n- stilliard/pure-ftpd:hardened\r\n\r\nA NiFi flow template is also available here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ijokarumawak/4fb05da103fd10f3ae6038f3388eb062\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for

closed\r\n\r\nDiscovered on Phoenix Database by using QueryDatabaseTable processor. The fix consists\r\non applying Matt Burgess' suggestion:\r\n\r\n\"I think we'd need a try/catch around the next() only to see if the result set is closed,\r\nand an inner try/catch around everything else, to catch other errors not related to\r\nthis behavior. \"\r\n\r\nThe solution was verified against Phoenix DB. Also added unit tests to cover the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
