on pattern-based binding rewriting work https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14446, I'm adding a new pass for combining parallel matmul sharing the same LHS into one. In contrast to the equivalent Relay pass which is based on dedicated pattern-matching algorithm (completely separate from dataflow pattern matcher), this pass is implemented in terms of the generic binding rewriting infra.\r\n\r\nWhen all matmul branches in a tree have the same set of fused ops, the fused ops are applied to the combined matmul output before slicing. So bias adds are also combined, for example. See the test cases. \r\n\r\nApplied to the SD UNet from web-stable-diffusion, it reduces the number of `R.matmul` from 200 to 100. See below for the IR comparison.\r\n\r\nBefore combining: https://gist.github.com/masahi/0dab4b8f53115da9c33f4352c9175a87\r\nAfter:

has type-annotations on variables, but not on each PrimExpr. Because some versions of LLVM (before LLVM 15) default to using typed pointers, passing LLVM validation may require correct pointer types. This is typically encountered in unpacking of PackedFunc arguments, where the LLVM type of a data array must be cast from `i8*` to a pointer to the buffer type.  These pointer-to-pointer casts are not expressible in TIR, because the `tir::CastNode` represents all pointers as `DataType::Handle()`, and so must be handled during codegen instead of earlier in the lowering

the `ObjectPath` utility allowed tracking of an object's location within a tree-like structure.  However, the base of the path structure was hard-coded to be the string `<root>`.  For use cases such as `StructuralEqual`, there is a clear root node.  However, other cases such as using `ObjectPath` to specify an object's location relative to a known variable, would require using that known variable's name as the root, rather than the hard-coded string `<root>`.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds an optional parameter to provide an alternative name for the root node, to allow for these use cases.","created_at":"2023-04-10T21:12:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T14:51:28Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T14:19:11Z","merged_at":"2023-04-12T14:19:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4c1995a98fc22a316a53c28b7eacb5240fc3f89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c485b3060d7984a1cf8dbdc52dda1df97322b99a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:objectpath_custom_name_of_root_obj","ref":"objectpath_custom_name_of_root_obj","sha":"c485b3060d7984a1cf8dbdc52dda1df97322b99a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR brings dynamic strided slice, which will be the first stab for data-dependent ops in Unity. \r\n\r\n### Overview \r\nIt consists of three parts (Op, TOPI, Legalization) and their test cases. \r\n\r\nData-dependent ops, like dynamic strided slice, could be tricky when we cannot automatically deduce their output shape. \r\nIn such cases, we cannot lower them since TE infra requires a concrete output shape, which should be defined with symbolic variables at least. Therefore, manual shape function registration is inevitable for those operators to let the compiler know how to compute their output shapes. \r\n\r\nWith this PR, users can register the shape func in TOPI and insert it with match cast mechanism during the legalization. \r\nIt's worth noting that for data-dependent ops, current TOPI creates symbolic variables whenever the shape value of certain dimension is unknown, then later mechanism handles the binding and so on. (see [link](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L672))\r\nHowever, with this PR, the legalizer would be in charge of creating symbolic variables and binding them explicitly, and then pass the output shape to TOPI so that TOPI can simply use it to define its compute. \r\n```Python\r\n@register_legalize(\"relax.dynamic_strided_slice\")\r\ndef _dynamic_strided_slice(bb: BlockBuilder, call: Call) -> Expr:\r\n    # 1. Insert shape function\r\n    output_shape = bb.normalize(\r\n        bb.call_te(\r\n            topi.shape_func_dynamic_strided_slice,\r\n            call.args[0],\r\n            call.args[1],\r\n            call.args[2],\r\n            call.args[3],\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    # 2. Convert tensor to shape and match cast with new symbolic vars\r\n    # Get shape length\r\n    ndim = int(output_shape.struct_info.shape[0])\r\n    output_shape = bb.emit(\r\n        Call(\r\n            ExternFunc(\"vm.builtin.tensor_to_shape\"),\r\n            [output_shape],\r\n            sinfo_args=[ShapeStructInfo(ndim=ndim)],\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    output_shape_vars = [tir.Var(\"s\", \"int64\") for i in range(ndim)]\r\n    bb.match_cast(output_shape, ShapeStructInfo(output_shape_vars))\r\n\r\n   # 3. Pass the output shape vars to TOPI\r\n    return bb.call_te(\r\n        topi.dynamic_strided_slice,\r\n        call.args[0],\r\n        call.args[1],\r\n        call.args[2],\r\n        call.args[3],\r\n        output_shape=output_shape_vars,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nThrough the internal discussion with @junrushao, we confirmed that this should comply with WIP PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14278. \r\nAlso, since this requires the change in existing `topi::dynamic_strided_slice` (see [link](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L709)),  this PR creates relax namespace and implements its own version. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n* Currently, in relax, we already have `relax.strided_slice` op that covers non-data-dependent scenarios. This is still useful since it can cover the current limitation of `relax.dynamic_strided_slice` op: its shape analysis may not be informative enough for its users like `tensor_to_shape`, which requires the known integer shape at compile-time.  \r\nWe will revisit their unification when we have a better understanding in the future. \r\n* This PR adapts the Relay's `topi::dynamic_strided_slice` to relax standards without fixing its current limitation. Therefore, it expects to perform preprocessing for `begin/end/strides` tensors to make them have the equal length with the dimension of `data` tensor.  PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14493 would be helpful for such pre-processing. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n* Currently, I named it \"dynamic\" strided slice only for simplicity and following the tradition. But, strictly speaking, data-dependent strided slice is more accurate since `relax.strided_slice` can already cover shape dynamism for `data` tensor. Any suggestion would be very helpful. \r\n* To maintain the relax version of TOPI, I created the relax namespace for now.

Introduction\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the high-level reverse-mode automatic differentiation pass  `Gradient` for Relax. It's the core component when we are trying training or fine-tuning in Relax IR.\r\n\r\nBefore upstreaming, this work is actively iterated and maintained in many forks like [mlc](https://github.com/mlc-ai/relax) and [relax-training](https://github.com/ACMClass-TVM-20/relax-training). Now it reaches a relatively stable version and it's time for us to upstream this important work to the unity branch.\r\n\r\nThe Python side API:\r\n- `Gradient(func_name: str, require_grads: Optional[Union[Var, List[Var]]] = None, target_index: int = 0) -> tvm.ir.transform.Pass`\r\n\r\nIt will transform the given funcion in the IRModule, and adds a new function that calculates the gradient with regard to the function's output.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n```\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main(\r\n        x: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\"), y: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    ) -> R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            lv1: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = R.add(x, y)\r\n            # use R.sum to reduce the tensor to a scalar\r\n            lv2: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\") = R.sum(lv1, axis=None, keepdims=False)\r\n            R.output(lv2)\r\n        return lv2\r\n\r\nAfter = relax.transform.Gradient(\"main\")(Module)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the transformed module `After` will be\r\n\r\n```\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass After:\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main(\r\n        x: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\"), y: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    ) -> R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            lv1: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = R.add(x, y)\r\n            lv2: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\") = R.sum(lv1, axis=None, keepdims=False)\r\n            R.output(lv2)\r\n        return lv2\r\n\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main_adjoint(\r\n        x: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\"), y: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    ) -> R.Tuple(\r\n        R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tuple(R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\"), R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\")),\r\n    ):\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            # original bindings\r\n            lv1: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = R.add(x, y)\r\n            lv2: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\") = R.sum(lv1, axis=None, keepdims=False)\r\n            # bindings w.r.t. intermediate variables\r\n            lv2_adjoint: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\") = R.ones((), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n            lv1_adjoint: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = R.broadcast_to(\r\n                lv2_adjoint, (3, 3)\r\n            )\r\n            # bindings w.r.t. parameters\r\n            x_adjoint: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = lv1_adjoint\r\n            y_adjoint: R.Tensor((3, 3), dtype=\"float32\") = lv1_adjoint\r\n            R.output(lv2, x_adjoint, y_adjoint)\r\n        # return value: (orig_return_values, tuple(adjoints))\r\n        return (lv2, (x_adjoint, y_adjoint))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we specify the target function `main` by its name. \r\nWe let the `require_grads` be default value (`None`) so it will calculate all inputs' adjoints (`x_adjoint`, `y_adjoint`) and return them. \r\nWe let the `target_index` be default value `0` so it will take the unique return value `lv2` as the target (the scalar we start to differentiate and propagating adjoints) of AD.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nMore details can be found in the following related links:\r\n- [Relax Training APIs Tutorial and Examples](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-training)\r\n   -

to this commit, the `bind_assign_value` implementation for TIR would treat assignment of constants (e.g. `j = 42`) as meta-variables to be inserted at their point of use.  This commit updates the parsing to treat `j = 42` as a shorthand for the TIR `LetStmt`, similar to the update made in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14320.  This behavior is more consistent with the other uses of `bind_assign_value` as assignment, with `j = T.meta_var(42)` used to represent meta-variables.","created_at":"2023-04-07T14:59:32Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T16:02:54Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T15:35:21Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T15:35:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddd2e81e491d047761cc53ad37dd6865218f5140","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/62e25bd51e2b0656815fac5dcc3de200a243680b","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_preserve_letstmt_of_constant","ref":"tvmscript_preserve_letstmt_of_constant","sha":"62e25bd51e2b0656815fac5dcc3de200a243680b","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Intro\r\n\r\nThis PR registers gradient functions for many high-level Relax operators. Similar with Relay, the gradient function is registered as an attribute `FPrimalGradient` (OpAttr) of corresponding Relax operators. But the function signature is different from Relay:\r\n```\r\nusing FPrimalGradient = runtime::TypedPackedFunc<tvm::Array<Expr>(\r\n    const Var& orig_var, const Call& orig_call, const Var& output_grad, const BlockBuilder& ctx)>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `orig_call` is the orginal call expr which we want to differentiate.\r\n\r\n- `output_grad` is the gradient of RHS.\r\n\r\n- `orig_var` is `y`. It is passed to saving some calculations.\r\n\r\n- `ctx` is the context which is not used right now. But we believe it is useful when it comes to dynamic shape cases and when we need to emit some bindings or do some normalizations.\r\n\r\nFor some complicate gradient functions, we introduce some high-level backward operators and put them under the namespace `op.grad.xxx`. All gradient functions are well tested (numerically). For more details please check Part 2 of [this document](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-training/blob/main/tutorial/Reverse_Mode_Automatic_Differentiation_in_Relax.md).\r\n\r\n### Others\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes two small problems about op:\r\n- `CumsumAttrs` isn't declared in the Python side.\r\n- A small problem in the implementation about legalizing op `variance`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Yixin

it has been assumed that when a fused function outputs a tuple, `TupleGetItem` needs to be attached to each output element to properly remap variables. But when an op that emits a tuple (e.g. `split`) is wrapped into a new function by this pass, that tuple can become the output of the fused function on its own. In such cases, a user of the output of such functions expects to get a tuple, so `TupleGetItem` must not be attached.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in the grouping algorithm, where `TupleGetItemPattern` that has been matched is not put into the matching group. \r\n\r\n@cyx-6

to this PR, the `ObjectRef::as<T>()` method could be used for any `T` that inherits from `tvm::Object`, and would return a `const T*` if the class could be cast to the specified type, or `nullptr` otherwise.  However, if the caller needed a `ObjectRef`, they would then need to call `GetRef<MyObjRef>` to convert from a `const T*`.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends `ObjectRef::as<T>` to operate on a `T` that inherits from `tvm::ObjectRef` as well.  In this case, the return type is `Optional<T>`, returning either an instance of the specified subclass, or `NullOpt` if the object was not an instance of the specified subclass.  Example usage of this new conversion, along with how it relates to existing functionality, is shown below.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Unconditionally convert, throwing an exception if the object isn't\r\n// of the specified type.  In contexts where the type of the object is\r\n// unknown, this shouldn't be used.\r\nPrimExpr expr = Downcast<PrimExpr>(obj);\r\n\r\n// Protect the Downcast from throwing an exception using IsInstance.\r\n// This avoids the error, but performs the type-checking twice.  In\r\n// addition, it requires the caller to specify both the ObjectRef\r\n// subclass and the Object subclass, even though these usually have a\r\n// 1:1 correspondence.\r\nif (obj->IsInstance<PrimExprNode>()) {\r\n  PrimExpr expr = Downcast<PrimExpr>(obj);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Perform both type-checking and downcasting with the ObjectRef::as()\r\n// method, then use GetRef to convert to an ObjectRef.  This avoids\r\n// double-checking the type, but still requires the caller to\r\nif (const PrimExprNode* ptr = obj.as<PrimExprNode>()) {\r\n  PrimExpr expr = GetRef<PrimExpr>(ptr);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// New method introduced by this PR.  The type-checking is only\r\n// performed once, and the Object subclass is inferred from the\r\n// ObjectRef subclass.\r\nif (Optional<PrimExpr> opt = obj.as<PrimExpr>()) {\r\n  PrimExpr expr = opt.value();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is implemented as two commits.  The first commit implements the new functionality, but makes no further changes.  The second commit looks for cases where `object_ref.as<TNode>()` was immediately followed by `GetRef<T>()`, replacing with either `object_ref.as<T>()` or with

to this PR, we first have a pass named `SimplifyNormInference` (https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14221), which is used to decompose `batch_norm` into simple operators for optimization during inference. And there are some follow-up changes:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14282 This PR introduces a policy to decompose `tensor_to_shape` op.\r\n- https://github.com/mlc-ai/relax/pull/170 In mlc, we make `SimplifyNormInference` support op simplification during training (Because `batch_norm` behaves differently in inference and training).\r\n- And in the future maybe there will be more operators needed to be decomposed.\r\n\r\nSo this PR polishes the changes in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14282 mainly in the following aspects:\r\n- Use one mutator (instead of two) to visit and decompose ops.\r\n- Separate inference and training by registering two passes (Adviced by TQ).\r\n- Shorten the name (DecomposeCompositeOps -> DecomposeOps)\r\n- Func Pass => Module Pass with `func_name` to specify the function we want to apply the pass (Or let it be `None` if we want to simplify all functions). This is because sometimes we only want to decompose operators in a specified function.\r\n\r\nNow the code is clear and easy to read. Now we use `if-else if-else if ...` pattern to recognize the op we want to decompose. In the future maybe we can introduce a map or register the decomposition policy in the op attribute, just like what we do in the `LegalizeOps` pass.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T17:44:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T16:53:11Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T16:53:11Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T16:53:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb479e66dd861151f363f6d959dcf24b5fbbee8e","assignee":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b6d670cabbfc2c864329b80b6837e2d50e1f152c","head":{"label":"SiriusNEO:unity-dev/2023-04-02-fix-decompose","ref":"unity-dev/2023-04-02-fix-decompose","sha":"b6d670cabbfc2c864329b80b6837e2d50e1f152c","user":{"login":"SiriusNEO","id":41781658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzgxNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41781658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO","html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":601263901,"node_id":"R_kgDOI9aPHQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"SiriusNEO/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SiriusNEO","id":41781658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzgxNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41781658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO","html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SiriusNEO/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SiriusNEO/tvm","description":"Open

using the vanila `take` op should be fine. I referred to how `pad` op is handled.\r\n\r\nNote this implementation works only for constant indices. To handle non constant indices, I'm guessing we should modify `src/relay/transforms/fake_quantization_to_integer.cc` so that it allows integer inputs without dequantize. Specifically, I think it should capture the following pattern:\r\n```\r\nx  i\r\n|  |\r\ndq |\r\n|  |\r\n\\  /\r\ntake\r\n |\r\n q\r\n```\r\nbut I'm not 100%

The bug\r\nCurrently, the `compute_inline` function would report an error if we try to `compute_inline` a block where the buffer has a symbolic shape, below is a minimal reproduction:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef failed_compute_inline(a: T.handle, b: T.handle):\r\n    N = T.int32()\r\n    A = T.match_buffer(a, (N, 32), \"float32\")\r\n    temp = T.alloc_buffer((N, 32), \"float32\", scope=\"local\")\r\n    B = T.match_buffer(b, (N, 32), \"float32\")\r\n    for i in range(N):\r\n        for j in range(32):\r\n            with T.block(\"T\"):\r\n                vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n                temp[vi, vj] = A[vi, vj] + 1\r\n        for j in range(32):\r\n            with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n                vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n                B[vi, vj] = temp[vi, vj] * A[vi, vj]\r\n\r\nsch = tvm.tir.Schedule(failed_compute_inline)\r\nT = sch.get_block(\"T\")\r\nB = sch.get_block(\"B\")\r\nj = sch.get_loops(B)[-1]\r\nsch.compute_inline(T)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the validity check analysis would use `UndefinedVars` to find variables that appeared in the block being `compute_inline` 'd. However, the `UndefinedVars` would visit `Buffer` and counts variables in buffer shape/strides,  and actually, we only care about buffer access indices. \r\n\r\n# Fix\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by adding a `visit_buffer` argument in the `UndefinedVars` function so that we can exclude variables that appeared in buffer shape/strides.\r\n\r\ncc @Lunderberg @cyx-6 @junrushao @wrongtest-intellif

As discussed and agreed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14417#discussion_r1152443315, remove `start_hint` feature to simplify the API and the implementation\r\n\r\n* To support the `start_hint` feature, the current algorithm has \"bidirectional\" nature: Matching can start from any node. This introduces recursive matching on both child and parent nodes, which makes the implementation complicated and reasoning about the algorithm almost impossible. Since this PR removes `start_hint`, we can now implement the algorithm in a purely one-directional manner, by starting matching from root nodes (those without parent nodes). Note that the pattern constraint graph is assumed to be a DAG. \r\n\r\n* The current implementation relies on side-effecting operations to maintain matchings. So when matching fails in the middle, we need to carefully \"undo\" matchings in the intermediate state (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14440). This, again, makes reasoning about the algorithm more difficult. I've reworked the data structure so that the matching algorithm is now \"purely functional\". Also, we can use `const` everywhere now.\r\n\r\nOverall, this PR makes the matching algorithm a fairly standard one based on backtracking search. The implementation is also easier to understand and safer.\r\n\r\n@ganler @sunggg @vinx13 @cyx-6

to this commit, the same `tir::Var` could be defined both in the body of the host function and in a parameters of the device function.  While this is legal, as TIR only requires SSA across each `PrimFunc`, this does result in failure to round-trip through TVMScript, because the round-tripped TIR uses a new `tir::Var` in each instance.  This PR adds a `ConvertSSA()` transform that can apply to an entire `IRModule`, in addition to the existing `ConvertSSA(Stmt)` utility.\r\n\r\nThis is part of changes described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14486, to improve round-trip failures that occur in

`kDeviceThreadAxis` defined the IterVar to be used for each thread/block axis, and `kUseDynamicSharedMemoryTag` defined whether dynamic memory allocations exist, which are primarily used to produce a list of strings by `tvm::codegen::ExtractFuncInfo`.  Because `kDeviceThreadAxis` is a `Array<IterVar>`, the IterVar is used prior to its definition site at `tir::attr::thread_extent`, which results in errors when attempting to round-trip through TVMScript.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces these attributes with\r\n`attr::kKernelLaunchParams`, which directly contains the kernel launch parameters.  These are expressed as an `Array<String>`, allowing the generated TVMScript to successfully round-trip.\r\n\r\nThis is part of changes described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14486, to improve round-trip TVMScript failures that occur in lowering.","created_at":"2023-04-04T16:24:59Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T22:02:31Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T21:20:23Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T21:20:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"28206d89d7881e4bf9a46a3acf2d8ec18aec0c1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/af5b25bbc4357b44d20a1bd54fa8cfeabc5c5994","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:func_attr_launch_params","ref":"func_attr_launch_params","sha":"af5b25bbc4357b44d20a1bd54fa8cfeabc5c5994","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `PrimFuncPass` directly removed empty `PrimFunc` objects from the module's `Map<GlobalVar, BaseFunc> functions`. Because it didn't update the `global_var_map_` as well, these two maps could become out of sync.  Since the `global_var_map_` is checked as part of `StructuralEqual()`, but isn't displayed when printing to TVMScript, this can result in identical printouts being flagged as non-identical.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `PrimFuncPass` to call the `IRModuleNode::Remove` method, which updates both the `functions` and `global_var_map_` variables.\r\n\r\nThis is part of changes described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14486, to improve round-trip failures that occur in lowering.","created_at":"2023-04-04T16:22:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T14:37:26Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T14:09:29Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T14:09:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"deb11d384e753907c8ce1ea93957888609622ad5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3e0fd2cfacd20415482a192c7b96df9774ca5774","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:transform_primfunc_remove_none_fix","ref":"transform_primfunc_remove_none_fix","sha":"3e0fd2cfacd20415482a192c7b96df9774ca5774","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR brings `ScatterElement` op that can be useful for preprocessing argument tensors in the frontend. \r\nFor example, for `topi::dynamic_strided_slice` expects its argument tensors (e.g., `begin`, `end`) to have the same rank with the data tensor. (see [link](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L657-L661))\r\n```C++\r\ninline Tensor dynamic_strided_slice(const Tensor& x, const Array<PrimExpr>& begin,\r\n                                    const Array<PrimExpr>& end, const Array<PrimExpr>& strides,\r\n                                    std::string name = \"T_dynamic_strided_slice\",\r\n                                    std::string tag = kInjective) {\r\n  const size_t src_tensor_dim = x->shape.size();\r\n  ICHECK_LE(begin.size(), src_tensor_dim);\r\n  ICHECK_LE(end.size(), src_tensor_dim);\r\n  ICHECK_LE(strides.size(), src_tensor_dim);\r\n  ICHECK_EQ(begin.size(), end.size());\r\n  ICHECK_EQ(begin.size(), strides.size());\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\nThus, frontend often needs to preprocess those argument tensors to make sure the later constraints are satisfied. \r\n\r\nFor example, say if we have the following situation: \r\n```Python\r\ndata_rank = 4\r\naxes = [2,0]\r\nbegin = [1,2]\r\n# We want to preprocess `begin` to \r\nnew_begin = [2, 0, 1, 0]  \r\n```\r\nWith `ScatterElement`, we can conveniently do so. \r\n```Python\r\nnew_begin = R.scatter_elements(\r\n           relax.const([0] * data_rank),   # data\r\n           axes,    # indices \r\n           begin,   # updates\r\n           axis=0, \r\n           reduction=\"update\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc. @jwfromm @yongwww @psrivas2

to this commit, the python API `tvm.tir.op.tvm_struct_set` defined the return type of `builtin::tvm_struct_set` as `\"handle\"`, while the C++ API `tvm::tir::TVMStructSet` defined the return type as `DataType::Int(32)`.  The data type used for this builtin has no effect, because no value is returned.  However, this discrepancy can cause failure to roundtrip through TVMScript.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the Python API to use `\"int32\"`, for consistency with the C++ API and with `CodeGenCPU`.\r\n\r\nThis is part of changes described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14486, to improve round-trip failures that occur in lowering.","created_at":"2023-04-04T16:03:01Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T11:50:52Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T07:06:03Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T07:06:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"25ec6460ce1d5d918b58eed026201a07a34fd3fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d7615fdf1121ef9190b80efac679233fc82422a5","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvm_struct_set_callnode_dtype","ref":"tvm_struct_set_callnode_dtype","sha":"d7615fdf1121ef9190b80efac679233fc82422a5","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this PR, the type annotations `PrimType(DataType::Handle())` and `PointerType(PrimType(DataType::Void()))` are both represented as `T.handle` in TVMScript, which can cause failures to round-trip between TIR and TVMScript.  This PR keeps `PrimType(DataType::Handle())` as `T.handle`, but updates the representation of `PointerType(PrimType(DataType::Void()))` to `T.handle(\"void\")` in order to distinguish between these two cases.\r\n\r\nThis is part of changes described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14486, to improve round-trip failures that occur in

to this PR, some of the IRModule transformations used during lowering can produce TIR that cannot be round-tripped through TVMScript.  Since TVMScript is the default method for printing all TIR, this can make it difficult to identify which pass has introduced a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThe first commit in this PR adds a test that checks whether a module can correctly round-trip from TIR to TVMScript and back, for each lowering pass used in `tvm.build`.  Each of the following independent commits resolves one of the issues found by the more general test, and adds a specific test for the round-trip failure that it resolves.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to break out these independent commits will be into separate PRs, for ease of review.  After all the component PRs have landed or found an alternative fix, this PR will be rebased to only consist of the new test itself, and will be opened for review.","created_at":"2023-04-04T15:33:53Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T15:25:57Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T15:25:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e269dabc31a46de9c3b2a962ddf7efeb146f1a67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14486/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14486/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14486/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0d81a4e6b927513a2e46d223fa2db22cddf89f99","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ir_module_tvmscript","ref":"ir_module_tvmscript","sha":"0d81a4e6b927513a2e46d223fa2db22cddf89f99","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`relax.op.take` implements semantics of [torch.take](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.take.html) which has a stronger restriction than its backing `topi.take` which seems to follow the semantics of [numpy.take](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.take.html). \r\ni.e., `relax.op.take` enforces its input `indices` to be 1-d tensor. \r\n\r\nTo match its behavior with `topi.take`, this PR extends the semantics of `relax.op.take` by removing such restriction without breaking existing test cases (except one for checking 1-d tensor restriction). \r\n\r\nAs a result,
