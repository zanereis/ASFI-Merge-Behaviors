SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes SQL Lab show rich error messages when refreshing queries that failed.\r\n\r\nThe steps needed were:\r\n\r\n1. Modify `superset/sql_lab.py` so that the SIP-40 error payload gets saved with the query in the `extra_json` column under the `errors` key.\r\n2. Modify the south pane component to attach `query.extra.errors` to `query.errors`, so that errors are shown with the rich error component.\r\n3. [Optional: Add a custom column error to the SQLite engine spec in order to test.]\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, when refreshing a failed query we'd see:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-06-14 at 17-57-06 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/121977057-f314f900-cd39-11eb-8626-b8e08ecd6624.png)\r\n\r\nAfter, when we refresh the page we see:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-06-14 at 17-55-58 Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/121976998-d678c100-cd39-11eb-847f-cd7f0a8476fb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `validate_parameters` endpoint was not performing the DB-specific Marshmallow validation (based on `parameters_schema`), but only the validation from the `validate_parameters` schema in the DB engine spec (which does more deep validation like checking if the host is resolvable and the port is open, but doesn't validate the schema).\r\n\r\nI changed the `DatabaseValidateParametersSchema` schema validation to also validate the DB-specific parameters, and changed the API to return the error messages expected by the frontend for the `onBlur` validation (with an `invalid` key in the `extra`).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it is impossible for users to remove themselves from the list of users. This is to avoid the risk of a user mistakenly being \"locked out\" of a chart/dashboard/etc. This can be inconvenient if an admin edits an object, as they automatically become owners of the edited object.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic as follows:\r\n- If an admin is editing an object, they can remove themselves from the list of owners. There is no risk of admins locking themselves out of an object, as they are able to edit all objects anyway.\r\n\r\nThe following is unchanged:\r\n- When a user (admins included) creates an object, they become the owner of the object.\r\n- When a non-admin edits an object and removes themselves from the list of owners, they are automatically re-added as owners. In other words, non-admin users have to be removed from the list of owners by another user (admin or regular).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently an admin is unable to remove themselves from the list of owners:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/121895878-5fd3c780-cd29-11eb-875b-273c323fc17e.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the admin can remove themselves from the owners:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/121895941-72e69780-cd29-11eb-988e-2ebea36a6c04.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Log in as admin\r\n- try to remove yourself from the list of owners\r\n- refresh the page, notice that \"Admin\" is again an owner\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nWhen dashboard first renders, we calculate tabs and charts in scope of each native filter. Before, we used to send a PUT request with the results, which also modified dashboard's metadata. This PR fixes that behaviour by saving the results only in redux, without sending them to the backend. Also, now we run the calculations only if the native filters feature flag is enabled\r\nThis PR is related to an issue raised by @graceguo-supercat in comments https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14933#discussion_r650331375 and https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14933#issuecomment-860168672. The problem with setting properties `show_native_filters` and `native_filter_configuration` was not caused directly by PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14933, but the problem was elevated by that PR because of sending unnecessary PUT request. The root of the issue will be handled in a separate PR by @villebro.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNotice that in \"AFTER\" screenshot there's no request to `/dashboard` endpoint which modifies metadata.\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121876082-70744580-cd09-11eb-87f8-278a831739e0.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121875923-4753b500-cd09-11eb-8652-732cd5701365.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag to True\r\n1. Add some native filters\r\n2. Reload the dashboard\r\n3. Verify that `SET_FILTER_SCOPES` action was dispatched and no request to `/dashboard` endpoint was made\r\n4. Verify that highlighting tabs and charts in scope of filters works as before\r\n5. Unset `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n6. Verify that `SET_FILTER_SCOPES` action was NOT dispatched\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new Select component based on the Antdesign Select. The goal of the refactoring is to eliminate all the various instances of selects throughout the codebase and merge them into one, while getting rid of the react-select entirely.\r\n\r\n###  PROPS\r\nAt the moment only _some_ of the Antd props have been exposed in the interface on top of the custom props. This is to make sure that the Select component is used with the intended behaviors. However, as the implementation of the new component goes, we might realize that other default props should be exposed. \r\n\r\n| Prop Name         | Origin | Type                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Prop exposed | Default behavior (prop not exposed) |\r\n| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |\r\n| mode              | Antd   | multiple OR tags                                                                 | Set mode of Select                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | x            |                                     |\r\n| truncateOptions   | Custom | true (default) OR false                                                          | When true it truncates the options with a long text and shows a tooltip.

The `options` property can accept a `Promise`. The Select component will do this for you:\r\n\r\n- Runs the fetch when the component mounts to load the initial options\r\n- It will check if the searched value already exists in the options and won't run the fetch in that case\r\n- It allows pagination when the property `paginatedFetch` is set and will automatically run the fetch by passing the current page as the user scrolls through the options\r\n- It will handle and print errors\r\n\r\n### WHAT'S MISSING (Upcoming in Iteration 2)\r\n\r\n- Paginate few px before the bottom of the scroll for better UX\r\n- Check/Discuss whether we need the onPaste and on closeOnScrollOut props\r\n- Remove the usage of any from the implementation\r\n- When allowNewOptions is true, showSearch should be true as well in Storybook\r\n- Our interface should only expose single and multiple modes\r\n- Test cases\r\n\r\nThis first iteration should be merged as it does not affect any existing functionality. @michael-s-molina  will take over the \"WHAT'S MISSING\" and any other change request in a separate PR as soon as this is merged (Iteration 2).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-11T15:28:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T23:43:33Z","closed_at":"2021-06-16T17:05:58Z","merged_at":"2021-06-16T17:05:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d578ae989797d73249e51b901d75a083dbd3e105","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"suddjian","id":1858430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian","html_url":"https://github.com/suddjian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces an optimization in running queries for native filters data. Currently when user opens a dashboard, we run queries for every native filter, regardless if it's hidden in the \"Filters out of scope\" panel or not. This PR defers running filter queries until the filter is visible.\r\nThere are 2 scenarios:\r\n1. Initially we run queries only for the filters in scope. When user uncollapses \"Filters out of scope\" panel, we run queries for all the filters that haven't been loaded yet.\r\n2. Initially we run queries only for the filters in scope. When user switches a tab, causing more filters to be in scope, we run queries only for the filters which have just become visible.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nPlease notice how many `data` requests there are in Network panel\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121710250-b64ac700-cad9-11eb-9ed0-df768225989f.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nScenario 1:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121710332-ccf11e00-cad9-11eb-80f2-7bf6f4bb0dbe.mov\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121710470-f01bcd80-cad9-11eb-8b8f-1104b18fc611.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag to True\r\n1. Create a dashboard with tabs\r\n2. Add a few native filters, so that some are initially in scope and some out of scope.\r\n3. Verify that we run queries only for filters in scope, until you open \"Filters out of scope\" panel or navigate to a tab that has charts in scope of other filters.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nwhen user run a query in SQL Lab, after query is done from engine, and then results are fetched into browser, SQL Lab should show results table. But when the results data is big, it may take a few seconds download. Many users saw the \"Refetch results\" button show up after query is succeed. Here is a screenshot:\r\nI run a simple query against Presto engine:\r\n```\r\nselect * from superset_production_logs_v01\r\nwhere ds > '2019-01-01'\r\n```\r\nBecause it has a lot of data, it takes long time to download results. SQL Lab shows  \"Refetch results\" for a few seconds, then after results are fetched, it shows results table.\r\n\r\n![68gFOulZiO-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/121631742-839ac300-ca34-11eb-95b7-bb94883d5713.gif)\r\n\r\nThis \"Refetch Results\" button is very confusing. Many users will just click the button, which cause SQL Lab even longer time to fetch results.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is pretty simple: race condition. SQL Lab polling query status every second, and once resultKey is returned, it will start another request to fetch result. Sometimes the fetching request sends out **_before_** the last poll request returned. So the last poll response reset query state from `fetching` to `success`, and this will trigger \"Refetch Results\" button. After fetch response returned, this strange state will be reset to correct state, results table will show up.\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to fix this race condition. Currently SQL Lab's query states are bad designed. It seems we are re-use same \"success\" state twice:\r\n`pending -> running -> success -> fetching -> success`\r\nthere are a lot of logic depends on the current states. If i introduce another state to replace the final \"success\", it will cause many trouble :( So my fix here is hacky but simple: if query is in \"fetching\" state, polling should not change its state back to \"success\". \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nSome dashboard reports were being generated with blank charts. Although we wait for the loading element to be removed from the page before taking the screenshot, there was still an instance where the chart was rendering nothing and hadn't yet been updated.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nShow a spinner while an export is being generated.\r\n\r\nThis is tricky because currently when the user clicks \"export\" we immediately redirect them to `/api/v1/database/export/?q=${rison.encode([database.id])}` using `window.assign`. So while we can set a spinner, we don't know when the download is generated to stop the spinner.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, in order to stop the spinner the frontend generates a short ID, which is passed to the backend with the export request. Once the export is ready, the backend will set a cookie with the short ID as name. The frontend is constantly polling for that cookie, and when it finds the cookie it hides the spinner.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this solution is that the GIF stops animating while the export is being generated, since the animation runs on the main thread. To keep the GIF animated the export code injects an iframe, and loads the export there. When the cookie indicating that the download is ready is found, the iframe is deleted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, no spinner.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/121730924-2559f880-caa5-11eb-82b3-aa31c89d18d2.mov\r\n\r\nNote: I added an artificial 5 seconds delay in generating the exports for the video, so the spinner can be seen.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nTested with all exports (see screencast). Also tested with the non-card view, though not shown in the video.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user changed filter type from \"Time range\" to \"Value\", the filter crashed. The reason was that in Value filter we assumed that `filterState.value` is either an array or undefined. When we switched filter type from \"Time range\", `filterState.value` was actually a string, which caused a crash.

SUMMARY\r\nPulls in the fix here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1162\r\n\r\nTooltips on nvd3 charts are buggy on dashboards, because if you hover over a chart before the rest of them load, the tooltips that have already been hovered on before disappear. This was because the migration to emotion added an extra div in between the chart container and the nvd3 chart, so we couldn't properly manage that chart's tooltips.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the bug by searching for the chart container all the way up the dom to get the proper chart id.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nSync code to superset, load a dashboard with nvd3 charts, hover over a chart to see the tooltip, force refresh a different nvd3 chart, see the first tooltip again after the second chart reloads.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

the ace editor when looking at value because it always renders \"xxx\". Something we can try to figure out in the future. In the meantime I added more tests around editing the other metrics. \r\n\r\nManual testing: click to edit a dataset, go to metrics, and try to add some test in the markdown field. It should show the text. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nA. cosmetic change to the Query History tab in SQL Lab caused some new statuses to be seen. They were causing errors for the Icon images that we have set up. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the 'fetching' status into QueryStatus for frontend and into the backend QueryStatus enum as well. Furthermore, it creates a config called 'error' in the frontend for any status that does not exist. This will hopefully allow for the users to continue using sql lab, but also make an engineer aware that the status is new and needs to be added. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

to show that query history still renders correctly. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to Sql Lab\r\nRun some queries\r\ncheck query history\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes the behaviour of hiding native filters out of scope, which was originally implemented in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14933.\r\nBefore, we considered filters to be \"in scope\" if they were placed in the last clicked tab. This approach presented several issues. The most significant issue was that in case of dashboards without top level tabs, there was no way to have charts unattached to any tab to be considered in scope once some row level tab had been clicked (as the scope was set only by clicking tabs).\r\nThe new proposal, implemented in this PR, is that we consider all visible charts to be \"in scope\". That means that in order to determine if a filter is in scope, we no longer check only the last clicked tab, but the whole tabs tree of the dashboard. For details, see attached recordings of the new native filters behaviour presented on dashboards with (the first video) and without (second video) top level tabs\r\n\r\nPotential improvement: rename \"Filters out of scope\" section or add a label for filters in scope to make it clear for the user why specific filters are out of scope. If you have any ideas, I'm open for suggestions üôÇ \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14933\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121371437-d6de1a00-c93d-11eb-9776-5ba53f35ab33.mov\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/121371703-0ab93f80-c93e-11eb-8b92-3d216a049450.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag to `True`\r\n1. Create dashboards with tabs (top level and/or row level)\r\n2. Add some native filters, go crazy with their scopes\r\n3. Verify that filters that don't have any visible charts in scope are moved to \"Out of scope\" panel\r\n4. Edit native filters's scopes and dashboard's layout (add some new tabs or charts) and verify that the feature \"picked up\" the changes\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI found a regression in the import flow.\r\n\r\nSome actions produce error messages that are actionable, and require intervention from the user. For example, if a user tries to import a database that already exists the backend will return an error. The frontend is supposed to capture that error, and ask the user for confirmation, resubmitting the ZIP file with an `overwrite=true` parameter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the user imports a DB that requires a password the backend will also return an error. The frontend should capture the error and prompt the user for the password, resubmitting the file with the needed passwords.\r\n\r\nThis is currently not working as expected. I rewrote the functions that identify these recoverable errors and fixed it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nImported an existing database, and confirmed that the modal asks for overwrite confirmation.\r\n\r\nImported a Postgres database, and confirmed that the modal asks for the password.\r\n\r\nIn master, both cases show an errror message.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdding a regex (matching semver) to match release branches for docker builds.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we import a BQ database (directly or indirectly) the `secure_extra` needs to be added manually. But when editing the DB the request fails because it tries to fetch `parameters`, which fails because `encrypted_extra` is empty:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n      @classmethod\r\n      def get_parameters_from_uri(\r\n          cls, _: str, encrypted_extra: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None\r\n      ) -> Any:\r\n          # BigQuery doesn't have parameters\r\n          if encrypted_extra:\r\n              return encrypted_extra\r\n\r\n          raise SupersetGenericDBErrorException(\r\n              message=\"Big Query encrypted_extra is not available.\",\r\n          )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore we couldn't edit a DB, now we can.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nImported BQ DB, was able to edit it successfully.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen importing a dataset, if a metric has `extra = {}` it doesn't get serialized to a string because it doesn't meet the condition `if metric.get(\"extra\")`. I fixed it by being explicit and checking `if metric.get(\"extra\") is not None`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe script used to benchmark migrations was failing with [this simple migration](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/migrations/versions/453530256cea_add_save_option_column_to_db_model.py). The root cause was obvious in hindsight, but it also raised errors on two unrelated migration scripts that have implicit relationships.\r\n\r\nAfter changing the two migration scripts I realized that the migration was failing because the model being benchmarked was out of sync with the underlying table. The script works this way:\r\n\r\n1. Identify models\r\n2. Downgrade DB\r\n3. Add instances of the models\r\n4. Upgrade DB\r\n5. Calculate duration\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it fails with a migration that adds a column. Imagine a migration that adds a column `b` to a model that has only a column `a`. This would happen:\r\n\r\n1. Identify models: found 1 model with 2 columns, `a` and `b`.\r\n2. Downgrade DB: table has now only column `a`.\r\n3. Add instances of the model ‚Äî this fails because the model has columns `a` and `b`!\r\n\r\nThe fix is easy, we just need to change the workflow swapping 1 <-> 2:\r\n\r\n1. Downgrade DB\r\n2. [Build models from table schema](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/automap.html) instead of reusing models from the codebase\r\n3. Add instances of the models\r\n4. Upgrade DB\r\n5. Calculate duration\r\n\r\nNow it works.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a couple minor things needed to get the migration working with Postgres UUIDs and encrypted columns from the `dbs` table.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 7\r\n- Changes the column select to use the Ant Design one\r\n- Removes horizontal scroll when the column select is too wide\r\n- Creates the first tests for the `FormConfigModal` component\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15000\r\n- Makes the fixed tabs take up the whole row in the modal\r\n- Fixes the pre-filter to consider the ad-hoc or time range when validating\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n- Comments from @rusackas \r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n\r\nSplit the FiltersConfigForm into smaller components to make it easier to read and remove react warnings\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the time range native filter defaults to \"Last week\" despite the new default being \"No Filter\" as introduced in #14661. This PR removes all references to \"Last week\" and leaves the time range value unset unless explicitly set. Other changes:\r\n- remove local state and replace with `filterState` (which the application has control over)\r\n- remove references to `defaultValue` (this is now fully handled by the application)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nWhen leaving the default value unset, the value shows up as \"Last week\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/121012661-9e550980-c7a0-11eb-95e1-412620c81031.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow it defaults to \"No

The `change dataset modal` can not display all datasets. \r\n\r\nThis PR make\r\n1. `Dataset list view` and `change dataset modal` datasets order is consistent\r\n2. make server pagination in `change dataset modal`\r\n3. All `datasets` can be displayed in `change dataset modal`\r\n4. backend sort by in `change dataset modal`\r\n5. use `owners` replace `creator`\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n<img width=\"1471\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/120994394-044c8b80-c7b7-11eb-9558-e19d7d8d425a.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After\r\nConsistent dataset list between `dataset list` and `Change dataset modal`\r\n<img width=\"1289\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/121183701-eeae9300-c896-11eb-9121-0699be40ea83.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/121185206-67fab580-c898-11eb-9f7c-5b0d61c79d9c.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe add `is_select_query` method to the `superset/db_engine_specs/base.py` to allow override it in the inherited specs.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nWe are working on the SQLAlchemy Kusto dialect (Azure Data Explorer) and want to propose the support of this dialect in Superset. The current problem is that KQL (Kusto Query Language) doesn't use \"SELECT\" keyword for queries, it is started from the table name instead. If we want to allow SQLLabs limits UI component to working properly, we need to have the ability to define which query is essentially the SELECT-query in our db engine spec file.\r\n\r\nMore details in the issue: #15011\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe functionality is still the same. Actually, you may just run any query in the SQLLab and verify that the limit (UI component) is still applying.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #15011\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently select filters make two requests for data upon initialization. This is due to the filter adding column type mappings to `ownState` on initialization. Since these are only needed when \"Search all options\" is enabled, the initial column type mappings are stored on initialization, and are added to `ownState` only when needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the \"Continent\" filter generates two requests (the last two requests to \"data\"); the first with `ownState: {}` and the second with `ownState: { colTypeMap: region: 1 }`. Note that the request is the same, due to `ownState` not changing the generated query in `buildQuery`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120992544-61cae300-c78b-11eb-82a4-917ada9cf81b.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow loading the Filter Tab only causes one single request on initialization, both when \"Search all options\" is enabled and disabled (`ownState` is added to `dataMask` when the first update happens):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120992416-41028d80-c78b-11eb-9b37-e0c2034036ab.png)\r\n\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this

SUMMARY\r\nWe have long running dashboard queries (2-3 minutes) which were getting tripped up by the 60 second timeout with 504 Gateway Timeout.\r\n\r\nI modified the dockerfile to keep the default 60 second timeout on gunicorn, but allow GUNICORN_TIMEOUT env to override.\r\n\r\nI also modified the values.yml to provide the needed placeholders to implementing a longer timeout at gunicorn, superset_webserver_timeout, and the nginx proxy timeout. \r\n\r\nNote: This change is non-disruptive, no end user will be impacted unless they turn on settings in the values.yaml.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Run a query on a dashboard that takes longer than 60 seconds, watch it time out.\r\n2. Apply patch, enable new helm lines, do same query, watch it work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are
