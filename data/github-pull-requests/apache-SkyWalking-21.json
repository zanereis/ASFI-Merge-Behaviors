Allow exclusive mode for WitnessMethod\r\n- [x] It is trivial.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [x] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [x] Not related to UI\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number. Closes #<issue number>.\r\n- [ ] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nFrom skywalking 8.4.0, witness method has been introduced. This feature enables those plugins to conduct enhancements only if some specific methods are found.\r\n\r\nIn our scenarios, we would like to enhance some classes in Kafka client module, but only if `public Object metricValue()` can be found in the `KafkaMetric` class (which means Kafka version >= 1.0.0) since we are using this method in plugin.\r\n\r\nAlso, we want to make enhancements targeting legacy Kafka versions (< 1.0.0) with other different interceptors.\r\n\r\nThe most intuitive way is to do the opposite, searching for `KafkaMetric` class but without `public Object metricValue()` method. However, this method is not support yet in Skywalking agent. Thus, this PR is to provide this possibility.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can do this in the following ways,\r\n\r\n- use `MethodUtil.isMethodExist` during the runtime like what we have done in Tomcat, Jetty plugins for servlet version compatibility.\r\n- in this specific case, we can check `@Deprecation` annotation on `@Deprecated public double value()` method. But this method will be totally removed in the next major release due to [KAFKA-12573](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10425)\r\n\r\nI suppose this PR can make improvement to the `WitnessMethod` feature.","created_at":"2021-04-01T10:04:22Z","updated_at":"2021-04-10T14:18:37Z","closed_at":"2021-04-10T14:18:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eab341e608de949d8241660cb8ca1b43ce18f86b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2448625664,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ4NjI1NjY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/don't%20merge","name":"don't

example \"GET\", which is inconvenient for system monitoring. Suppose one sees tens of Redis spans in one trace, and he wants to know what are they. Unfortunately he can't get this currently in an accurate way. What he can get is a list of \"SET\" or \"GET\", but \"SET\" for what, \"GET\" for what, are unknown for him. So I create this pull request to enhance this, enhanced UI screenshots are shown in the last three pictures.\r\n\r\nCurrent UI:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263555-75959b80-8caa-11eb-81cb-fef24bc95243.png)\r\n\r\nEnhanced UI:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263577-80e8c700-8caa-11eb-85ea-a1346855e559.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263590-8514e480-8caa-11eb-8e76-1decd66d9c5e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10150693/112263600-880fd500-8caa-11eb-84fc-d2c75ac17ff6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [x] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [x] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.

Add function `retagByK8sMeta` and opt type `K8sRetagType.Pod2Service` in MAL for k8s to relate pods and services.\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [X] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [X] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number. Closes #<issue number>.\r\n- [X] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nSince K8s metrics collector can't provide the relationship between pods and services. I collected this info from the `K8s API Server`, then we can add specific tags to the samples to build the relationship.\r\n\r\n## retagByK8sMeta\r\n`retagByK8sMeta(newLabelName, K8sRetagType, existingLabelName)`. Add a new tag to the sample family based on an existing label's value. Can provide several internal converting types.\r\n\r\nThis pr provide: \r\n### K8sRetagType.Pod2Service  \r\nAdd a tag to the sample by using `service` as the key, `$serviceName.$namespace` as the value, by the given value of the tag key, which represents the name of a pod.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\ncontainer_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container=my-nginx, cpu=total,

log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nIn HBase Client 2.x, the `HTable` constructor function has a little difference after `2.2.0`.\r\nSo the agent plugin should have 3 `ConstructorInterceptPoint`, I have tested it all in `test/plugin/scenarios/hbase-scenario`, just change the dependency version.\r\n\r\nThe e2e test cases haven't committed, I will commit it
