The reason for this is that if brokers disagree about which partitions are under min ISR, it breaks the KIP-966 replication invariants. In order to enforce this, when the eligible.leader.replicas.version feature is turned on, we automatically remove all broker-level min.insync.replicas overrides, and create the required cluster-level override if needed. Similarly, if the cluster was created with eligible.leader.replicas.version enabled, we create a similar cluster-level record. In both cases, we don't allow setting overrides for individual brokers afterwards, or removing the cluster-level override.\r\n\r\nSplit ActivationRecordsGeneratorTest up into multiple test cases rather than having it be one giant test case.\r\n\r\nFix a bug in QuorumControllerTestEnv where we would replay records manually on objects, racing with the active controller thread. Instead, we should simply ensure that the initial bootstrap records contains what we want.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Colin P.

the stricter configuration validation changes(#16048, #16319) that broke compatibility when used space-separated broker list with version >= 3.8 and < 4.0\r\nPreviously, a space-separated broker list, say with 3 brokers, would be parsed as an ArrayList containing a single string instead of three separate strings. The single string would then pass through the `getHost` function, which would extract only the first broker.\r\n\r\nAfter applying stricter configuration validation in  `getHost` function, using a space-separated broker list results in an exception.\r\n\r\n#### Why when the space separated broker list is provided, the broker list is parsed as ArrayList with single string element:\r\nBecause we define the type of bootstrap server config as List, and List config will be parsed using comma separated pattern\r\n*

the stricter configuration validation changes(#16048, #16319) that broke compatibility when used pass space-separated broker list with version >= 3.8\r\nPreviously, a space-separated broker list would be parsed as an ArrayList containing a single string instead of three separate strings. The single string would then pass through the `getHost` function, which would extract only the first broker.\r\n\r\nAfter applying stricter configuration validation, using a space-separated broker list results in an exception.\r\n\r\n#### Why when the space separated broker list is provided, only the first broker is parsed as ArrayList with single string element\r\nBecause we define the type of bootstrap server config as List, and List config will be parsed using comma separated pattern\r\n*

solved a critical race condition by returning with CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS early when the transaction was still completing. \r\nIn testing, it was discovered that this early return could cause performance regressions.\r\n\r\nPrior to KIP-890 the addpartitions call was a separate call from the producer. There was a previous change https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5477 that decreased the retry backoff. With KIP-890 and making the call through the produce path, we go back to the default retry backoff which takes longer. Prior to 18575 we introduce a slight delay when sending to the coordinator, so prior to 18575, we are less likely to return quickly and get stuck in this backoff. However, based on results from produce benchmarks, we can still run into 100ms backoff in some scenarios. \r\n\r\nThis PR reverts KAFKA-18575, and doesn't return early and wait until the coordinator for checking if a transaction is ongoing. Instead, it will fix the handling with the verification guard so we don't hit the edge condition. \r\n\r\nAlso cleans up some of the verification text that was unclear.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-28T00:05:38Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T23:24:34Z","closed_at":"2025-02-03T23:24:34Z","merged_at":"2025-02-03T23:24:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab8ef87c7f920894566c25234e9ed2d8f1f9cce2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

However, in the async consumer, this logic is either missing or only applies to individual requests. Unlike the classic consumer, where `request.timeout.ms` works for the entire coordinator closing behavior, the async implementation handles timeouts differently.\r\n\r\nWe should align the close timeout-handling to enable `ConsumerBounceTest#testClose`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

patch removes the explicit failure of test tasks in Gradle when there is a flaky test. This also fixes a fall-through case in junit.py where we did not recognize an error prior to running the tests (such as the javadoc task).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch removes usages of `ignoreFailures` in our CI and changes the XML copy task to a finalizer task instead of doLast closure. \r\n\r\n## JUnit XML files\r\n\r\nWe have an extra action that runs as part of \":test\" and \":quarantinedTest\" which copies the JUnit XML files to a centralized build directory. This is done so that our custom test parser (junit.py) can parse only the tests that were run as part of the build. \r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, we were doing this in a `doLast` closure which required us to run with `ignoreFailures`. A better approach is to use a finalizer task which is run regardless of task outcome. This achieves the same result without the need for `ignoreFailures`. This simplifies the build code a bit and is a more idiomatic approach.\r\n\r\n## Task Outcome and Caching\r\n\r\nWhen the build cache is enabled, Gradle will cache the task results as long as the task is successful. This means, if a \":test\" task fails, it will not be cached. Previously, we had included special behavior in our \":test\" and \":quarantinedTest\" tasks to forcibly fail the task if there was _any_ test failure -- even a failure that was followed by a successful re-run via Develocity's retry mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe intention of this change was to prevent the caching of flaky test runs to avoid masking those failures. However, since we now have reliable reporting of flaky tests via Develocity and our nightly test report, we do not need to over-expose our flaky tests to PR authors.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the special exit behavior we had in Gradle and allows the trunk build to cache flaky test results. The trunk build will continue to always run every test. PRs will be able to consume the cache from trunk and avoid running unaffected tests. This should allow PRs to run more quickly and utilize fewer build resources.\r\n\r\nHere are the possible outcomes of our \":test\" and \":quarantinedTest\" tasks:\r\n\r\n| Test results | Task result | Gradle exit | junit.py exit |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| No failures | 0 | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Flaky failures | 0 | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Too many flaky | 1 | 1 | 1 |\r\n| Error (no tests run) | N/A | 1 | 1 |\r\n\r\nThis not only simplifies the mapping of task outcomes to exit codes, but it aligns more closely with the way Gradle is designed and how the Develocity plugin works.","created_at":"2025-01-23T19:53:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T23:42:40Z","closed_at":"2025-01-29T23:42:40Z","merged_at":"2025-01-29T23:42:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"617196c68eb64951274a24fd978785e3caa786b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

aims at adding the support for the ListShareGroupOffsets AdminClient functionality. This PR is a followup on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/18571. The previous PR had added the handling for `ReadShareGroupStateSummaryRequest`. This one continues to make changes for handling the `DescribeShareGroupOffsetsRequest`\r\n\r\nThe Flow diagram as per the KIP:\r\n<img width=\"816\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 6 29 16 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/467774a5-e104-4a4e-8276-cbffbbbea493\" />\r\n\r\nKey Changes in the PR:\r\n- Added handling of `listShareGroupOffsets()` in `KafkaAdminClient` and adding the corresponding tests to `KafkaAdminClientTest`.\r\n- To aid the above, we use `DescribeShareGroupOffsetsHandler` class. Here is where the request is created and it also houses the handling of the same and conversions needed. One thing to note here is that, I have specified the`buildBatchedRequest()` method in such a way that the request is for one single `groupId` though it specifies a Set. I think we need to update the KIP to ensure that `listShareGroupOffsets()` takes a `(String, ListShareGroupOffsetsSpec)` instead of a Map given that the `DescribeShareGroupOffsetsRequest` can currently handle only a single groupId request. Here it diverges from the way `listConsumerGroupOffsets` is handled as the `OffsetFetchRequest` supports fetching offsets for multiple groups together (from v8)\r\n- Changes made to `KafkaApis` for `handleDescribeShareGroupOffsetsRequest`. One thing to be noted here is that the `DescribeShareGroupOffsetsRequest` uses the topic Name while the `ReadShareGroupStateSummaryRequest` needs the topic Uuid. Hence the conversion takes place in `KafkaApis` itself before relaying the same to the GroupCoordinator.\r\n- The `GroupCoordinator` now has `describeShareGroupOffsets` method where it handles the `DesribeShareGroupOffsets` request. Since here the call was to be made via the persister, code has been added for the same.\r\n- `GroupCoordinatorService` now additionally has the Persister. This is passed from the `BrokerServer` which passes the `NoOpPersister` in case KIP-932 isn't enabled on the clusters or `DefaultStatePersister` in case Share Groups are enabled.\r\n- Test changes for the various GroupCoordinator classes.\r\n- Changes to the `ShareGroupCommand` (and the tests) to make a call to the `listShareGroupOffsets` method to get the start offset.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-22T17:11:34Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T14:38:09Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T14:38:09Z","merged_at":"2025-02-05T14:38:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dbed2f6e82ec4f064023da6f7612a875f68ba92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"smjn","id":787991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4Nzk5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn","html_url":"https://github.com/smjn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smjn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

`AbstractCoordinator#joinGroupIfNeeded` calls `ConsumerNetworkClient#poll(RequestFuture, Timer)` [0]. It calls another method with `disableWakeup = false`. If `joinFuture` is not done, ConsumerNetworkClient does poll multiple times before timer is expired [1]. If `joinFuture` finishes too fast, the SyncGroupRequest can't be handled in `AbstractCoordinator#ensureActiveGroup`, so it doesn't throw WakeupException.
