Description ##\r\nThis implements \"Fix 1\" from [this discussion on discuss.mxnet.io](https://discuss.mxnet.io/t/fixing-thread-safety-issues-in-scala-library/236), as well as fixing various resource leaks throughout the Scala library (separate commit).\r\n\r\nThe short version is:\r\n\r\n* MXNet is not safe to call from multiple threads. Finalizers call from a separate thread in Java, so they are unsafe to use to call MXNet. We have seen this cause memory corruption and failures.\r\n* Removing the finalizers means one can inadvertently leak resources that should be disposed. For this reason optional tracing behaviour is added to the library, to help users track down leaks.\r\n* The separate commit fixing leaks fixes as many leaks as were required for us to do large prediction tasks (hundreds of millions of predictions) using a `Module` without incurring either memory corruption (as we did before the finalizers were removed) or memory exhaustion (as we did after they were removed). We now see no detected leaks. However for training we still see a relatively small number.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make scalapkg`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage _(see below)_\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] WarnIfDisposed trait replaces finalizers, _no tests_, API docs updated to remove references to the \"GC strategy\".\r\n- [x] Leaks fixes, _no tests_ (no visible functional change)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- We didn't find a non-intrusive way to write a test suite for these changes. Let us know if we should try harder to find one.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-30T09:32:12Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T08:40:16Z","closed_at":"2017-12-04T18:01:12Z","merged_at":"2017-12-04T18:01:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"14cd740fbdf52a83a7066f268c5e28d583459666","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/eb824a2fb55505869e6638a503264e88215c2649","head":{"label":"calumleslie:scala-deprecate-finalizers","ref":"scala-deprecate-finalizers","sha":"eb824a2fb55505869e6638a503264e88215c2649","user":{"login":"calumleslie","id":13674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie","html_url":"https://github.com/calumleslie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112348349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzNDgzNDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"calumleslie/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"calumleslie","id":13674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie","html_url":"https://github.com/calumleslie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calumleslie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/calumleslie/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nWhen trying to convert any non empty string to bool, python returns True. \r\n> bool('False') \r\n> True\r\n\r\nThis means if a bool argument (`--shuffle`) has a default value of True, then passing `--shuffle False` will not set it to False. \r\n\r\nCorrecting this by converting the string argument given to bool with a custom function. \r\n\r\nThe proper way would be `--shuffle` and `--no-shuffle`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nDuring some benchmarking I discovered that the CUDA internal batching implementations for trsm and gemm operators were slow for large matrices. For gemm, found that the gemmStridedBatch implementation is faster at all matrix sizes so we should use that when possible (cuda 8+) Otherwise, since most use cases for these operators use relatively large matrices, use a simple for loop for batch calls instead of the specific batched cuda implementation.   \r\n\r\nAlso added instructions for how to compile with a full MKL installation instead of just the MKL2017 subset. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ X ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ X ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ X ] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [ X ] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n* Changed GEMM operator to use gemmStridedBatch CUDA implementation when CUDA is version 8 or higher, otherwise to just do batching manually.\r\n* Changed TRSM operator to not use the CUDA batching functionality as it's slower for large matrices. Instead do batching manually.\r\n* Added instructions for using a full MKL installation instead of just MKL2017\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n## Reviewers ##\r\n- @mseeger , @asmushetzel, @zhenwendai

Description ##\r\nAdd [mxnet.text APIs](http://mxnet-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/api/python/text/text.html) (new features). This is intended to be used in natural language processing applications.\r\n\r\n* Text processing utilities. \r\n    * count_tokens_from_str\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text indexer class\r\n    * Build indices for the unknown token, reserved tokens, and input counter keys. Indexed tokens can be used by instances of `mxnet.text.embeddings.TextEmbedding`, such as instances of `mxnet.text.glossary.Glossary`.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text pre-trained embedding class.\r\n    * This is the text embedding base class. To load text embeddings from an externally hosted pre-trained text embedding file, such as those of GloVe and FastText, use `TextEmbedding.create(embedding_name, pretrained_file_name)`. To get all the available `embedding_name` and `pretrained_file_name`, use `TextEmbedding.get_embedding_and_pretrained_file_names()`.\r\n    * Alternatively, to load embedding vectors from a custom pre-trained text embedding file, use `mxnet.text.embeddings.CustomEmbedding`.\r\n    * For the same token, its index and embedding vector may vary across different instances of `mxnet.text.embedding.TextEmbedding`.\r\n\r\n\r\n* GloVe pre-trained text embedding\r\n    * GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space. (Source from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)\r\n\r\n\r\n* The fastText pre-trained text embedding\r\n    * FastText is an open-source, free, lightweight library that allows users to learn text representations and text classifiers. It works on standard, generic hardware. Models can later be reduced in size to even fit on mobile devices. (Source from https://fasttext.cc/)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Custom pre-trained text embedding\r\n    * This is to load embedding vectors from a user-defined pre-trained text embedding file.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text glossary class.\r\n    * This provides indexing and embedding for text and special tokens in a glossary. For each indexed token in a glossary, an embedding vector will be associated with the it. Such embedding vectors can be loaded from externally hosted or custom pre-trained text embedding files, such as via instances of `mxnet.text.embedding.TextEmbedding`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.

Description ##\r\nStarting from OpenCV3.3 the `imdecode` function will automatically rotate the image based on the EXIF' orientation flag.\r\n```c++\r\nMat imdecode( InputArray _buf, int flags )\r\n{\r\n    CV_TRACE_FUNCTION();\r\n\r\n    Mat buf = _buf.getMat(), img;\r\n    imdecode_( buf, flags, LOAD_MAT, &img );\r\n\r\n    /// optionally rotate the data if EXIF' orientation flag says so\r\n    if( !img.empty() && (flags & IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION) == 0 && flags != IMREAD_UNCHANGED )\r\n    {\r\n        ApplyExifOrientation(buf, img);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return img;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be disabled by setting the `cv::IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION` flag.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] add `IMREAD_IGNORE_ORIENTATION` flag when opencv 3.3 is used.\r\n\r\n## Comments
