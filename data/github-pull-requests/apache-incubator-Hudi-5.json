Change Logs\r\n\r\nbecause in hudi HoodieSparkEngineContext the jobGroupId is set as activeModule  , so when the query cancelling happens and thrift server tries to find active jobs with the SQL statement id and nothing will be found.\r\n\r\nAny users including OSS using spark-hudi have such issue, not just OH.\r\nThis issue can be simply avoided by not overriding jobGroupId with activeModule.\r\n\r\nInitial state: there is a spark job inflight, enter Ctrl+C in beeline\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/394c6cf8-86bb-40e2-ab8f-732ffb1449f2)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the change: \r\nJob group of spark task and query statement id are the same\r\nthe inflight job will be aborted as soon as the interruption is acked, which can be told by 1. the failed job has 0 task completed as I stop the job at the very beginning of the execution. 2. The inflight job end up as a \"Failed job\". Also I can see the job execution throws execption whose case is \"InterruptedException\" which is caused by thread.cancel(). (the 1st figure)\r\nAlso no new jobs will be scheduled, which can be proved by no new jobs scheduled after the failed job occurs (the 1st figure). Plus the same uninterrupted query with no interruption, there are much more completed jobs (the 3rd figure).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4609578-f774-4b53-b5bd-fdf0a71c2b31)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ced873c-7053-4d55-aad3-f0e195737440)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aefbebe-97c0-47cb-922b-4c12f368b23c)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nDelivering the query interruption at the same spot where we have a new spark job inflight, we saw:\r\n[Same as After] No new jobs got scheduled after the interruption is acked.\r\n[Diff from After] For the inflight one it continues to execute until becomes a \"Completed Job\".\r\n[Diff from After] Each spark job group id is overridden as the hudi module that is currently running, instead of using the SQL statement Id.\r\n(start of spark jobs)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38bd8010-20a7-4e59-9812-3f9bb18330a7)\r\n\r\n(after cancellation) the interrupted task is shown as a \"Completed job\"\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8bbccc-71fe-4796-96f0-7d95394095b8)\r\n\r\n\r\nOther coverage:\r\nWhen there is inflight spark job, terminate beeline connection - It's the same as Ctrl+C.\r\nIf localhost port-forward is killed (simulating connection loss), the behavior is the same as cancelling query with Ctrl+C\r\nI see logs when spark lost connection with client the relevant job will be cleaned up\r\n```\r\n24/11/27 11:01:54 INFO Executor: Executor killed task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1), reason: Stage cancelled\r\n24/11/27 11:01:54 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1) (10.0.0.72 executor driver): TaskKilled (Stage cancelled)\r\n24/11/27 11:01:54 INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Removed TaskSet 1.0, whose tasks have all completed, from pool \r\n24/11/27 11:01:55 INFO DAGScheduler: Asked to cancel job group ebecc7ab-14f4-4d17-9060-7b7ed054fe63\r\n24/11/27 11:01:55 WARN SparkExecuteStatementOperation: Ignore exception

interruption\r\n```\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen we cancel spark sql queries, either by disconnecting the client from network or ctrl+C when running queries over tools like beeline, it will kill the entire query including the inflight spark job.\r\n\r\nWithout this change, when cancelling queries, it will not exit until the current spark job finishes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-28T00:56:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T19:36:19Z","closed_at":"2025-01-03T19:36:18Z","merged_at":"2025-01-03T19:36:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6d4e8893ae34d0c9868fd8b0d50cd69f8c33f00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe have to ensure users intuitively understand what we are shipping. Let's align with existing terminology of a popular database than inventing our own \"names\".\r\nPostgres uses \"Expression indexes\" . and we can change our terminology to be the same.\r\n\r\n- References to \"Functional Index\" in docs/code/RFC changes to \"Expression Index\"\r\n- \"func\" becomes \"expr\" (no need to change syntax with an \"expression\" clause like pg yet.\r\n- Change anything in storage like prefix \"func_index_\" or the hoodiemetadata.avsc fields or the index defs files. (need to be really really thorough)\r\n\r\nHere's how we need the experience to be.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE INDEX name ON table (primaryKeyColumn); -- should create RLI effectively, alternatively `WHERE primaryKeyColumn = | IN ` has to work with RLI is enabled via Streamer/Datasource config. Need to test/confirm this.  \r\nCREATE INDEX name ON table (someOtherColumn); -- should create secondary_index backed by RLI, remove secondary_index as an option in using clause, if no index type is specified SI is the default. \r\nCREATE INDEX name ON table USING BLOOM_FILTERS(column) options(expr='lower'); -- build a bloom filter from lower case version of column\r\nCREATE INDEX name ON table USING COL_STATS(column) options(expr='from_unixtime', format='yyyy-MM-dd'); -- build date based indexing of ts column\r\nCREATE INDEX name ON table USING COL_STATS(column);  -- should just add to the column stats? (or) should we disallow this for now?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRefines the syntax for index creation in Hudi\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nSQL Index creation syntax is as follows:-\r\n```\r\nRLI index creation for Simple record key:-\r\ncreate index record_index on $tableName (id)\r\n\r\nRLI index creation for Complex record key\r\ncreate index record_index on $tableName (id,price)\r\n\r\nSecondary Index creation\r\ncreate index idx_name on $tableName (name)\r\n\r\nOptions are not used with RLI or SI. RLI index can be created only if name `record_index` is used.\r\n\r\nExpression Index using col stats and bloom filters\r\nColumn Stats\r\ncreate index name_lower on $tableName using column_stats(ts) options(expr='from_unixtime', format='yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nFor Column stats, some expression should be mentioned.\r\n\r\nBloom Filter\r\ncreate index idx_bloom_$tableName on $tableName using bloom_filters(city) options(expr='upper')\r\ncreate index idx_bloom_$tableName on $tableName using bloom_filters(city) options(fpp=0.00000000001)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-27T17:51:40Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T21:48:59Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T21:48:59Z","merged_at":"2024-11-28T21:48:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"80de4d2e355037073cafdb944b65e75088309808","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Add checkpoint translation logic when switching from 0.x/table version 6 (commit request time based checkpoint) to 1.0/ table version 8 (commit completion time based checkpoint).\r\n- Add a new `Checkpoint` API with `StreamerCheckpointV1` and `StreamerCheckpointV2` implementation corresponding to tv 6 and tv 8 respectively.\r\n- Checkpoint translation done in new API `Source.translateCheckpoint`, which can be overridden depending on source. And `CheckpointUtils` to support translation methods.\r\n- To pull the data, two different `IncrementalRelationV1` and `IncrementalRelationV2` have been added.\r\n- Add tests to validate translation in TestCheckpointUtils, and functional test in TestHoodieIncrSource.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNew public API changes in `Checkpoint`, `Source`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere is some behavior divergence across base and log files. If user explicitly override the list of columns to index, we were generating stats for base files, but missing to generate it for log files. Also, on the pruning side, nested fields were ignored. \r\nSo, for now we are cleaning up to unify the behavior. no nested fields are supported at the moment. We have filed a follow up  jira (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8582) to add nested field support properly for col stats. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCode clean up and consistent col stats behavior. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix data skipping with RLI if record key is composite. When there are multiple record key fields, we need to form the record keys sequence correctly. Added a test to show skipping with more than one record key fields.\r\nWe make a call to filterRecord key function for every record key and verify if there are literals available for every record key. If that is the case we can filter on the combination of such literals.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupport data skipping for complex primary keys\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPreviously we update the merge mode for COW to be event time ordering; for MOR to be commit time. However, for COW tables with OverwriteWithLatestPayload, their compactions work as expected, since they don't have logs files, and records within different commits obeys commit time ordering. However, for MOR, since there could multiple log files for a base file, the merge orders for records from different logs may not obey \r\nSince we want to avoid the compaction issue for MOR, we upgrade the opposite way.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLOW.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade a table with `OverwriteWithLatestPayload`, we follow the following rule:\r\n1. For COW table, we change its payload class to `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload` class, and merge mode is `EventTimeOrdering`.\r\n2. For MOR table, we keep its payload class, and set the merge mode to `CommitTimeOrdering`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBetter upgrade process.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`/etc/hudi/conf` is the default hudi conf path, We add it to conf paths by default.\r\nWhen we do `export HUDI_CONF_DIR=/etc/hudi/conf`,  it is double referenced.\r\nTo avoid confusing error message, we check if the default conf path has been added before we add it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoid confusing message.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nBetter UX.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Fixing Secondary Index Record generation to not rely on WriteStatus. \r\n- This is stacked on top of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12269 \r\n\r\nSI record generation is of two steps: \r\na. Find record keys that are updated or deleted and add deleted records to SI index. We will do a lookup of the same in SI to find the SI, record key combo and prepare delete records. \r\nb. For the latest data (inserted or updated), we read the records to find SI value, record key combination to generate new insert records to ingest to SI. \r\n\r\nAmong the above steps, (a) is the one which was relying on WriteStatus. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, we are only fixing (a). i.e. Finding the list of records keys that got updated or deleted in the current commit of interest will not rely on WriteStatus, but do on-demand read from data files. \r\nBased on time permitting for the 1.x release, we might have a follow up patch, where we can unify steps a and b and get it done in one step.  \r\n\r\nThis patch definitely has to go in to remove the dependency on WriteStatus. The optimization of merging steps a and b will be followed up based on available bandwidht and timeframe before we wrap up 1.0. It is an optimization step and not really impacts correctness. Since Secondary Index itself is a new feature that we are introducing in 1.x, we wanted to take care of correctness and reliability in the first place. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Fixing Secondary Index Record generation to not rely on WriteStatus. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-21T21:17:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T04:43:17Z","closed_at":"2024-12-17T04:43:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd new config `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns` with default of 32. \r\nIf user does not set `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.column.list` then the new config will limit the number of columns to generate stats for. If `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.column.list` has more columns than `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns` it will still generate column stats for all the columns set in the config. The new config just limits the naive case where a user could have hundreds or thousands of columns and enables col stats and then performance is bad. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will always index the meta fields: _hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path when col stats is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of the config. Lets say the table schema is:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_commit_seqno, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, _hoodie_file_name, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 1, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 3, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_3\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 5, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 10, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, for `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns` we will only index supported column types of: bool, int, long, float, double, bytes, string\r\n\r\nLets say in the above same schema that c_3 has a map type but the rest of the column types are strings. Then,\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 3, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_4\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 5, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_4, c_5\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \"hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.max.columns\" is 10, then the following cols will be indexed:\r\n_hoodie_commit_time, _hoodie_record_key, _hoodie_partition_path, c_1, c_2, c_4, c_5\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nconfig to limit number of colstats generated \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue when the precombine field is not set with the merge mode of `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING`. Note that after #12600, there is no default of the precombine field config and it is no longer required for `COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING`.  For `EVENT_TIME_ORDERING`, if the precombine field is not set, the logic should fall back to use the default ordering value of `(int) 0` which has the highest priority (i.e., commit time ordering).\r\n\r\nDetailed fixes include:\r\n- Handles no precombine field when getting the ordering value in `HoodieSparkRecord` and `HoodieAvroIndexedRecord` to avoid NPE;\r\n- Checks both empty and null for precombine field name to avoid issues;\r\n- Considers empty ordering field specified by the Hudi Streamer when creating HoodieRecords from the Streamer.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added in `TestMORDataSource` and `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` to cover the failure cases without this PR.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupports no precombine field with EVENT_TIME_ORDERING merge mode.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing SI MDT record generation in MDT to not rely on RDD<WriteStatus> \r\nThis is a stacked patch over https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12269 \r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd patch among series of patch. \r\nIn this patch, we are making SI to not rely on RDD<WriteStatus>. \r\nSI needs to know what record keys have been deleted or updated so that it can delete those entries from SI. We are only adjusting this to not depend on the writeStatus. \r\n\r\nWe had to make some changes to our RLI and SI records are generated. \r\nWe do not want to read from data files repeatedly(once for RLI and again for SI). And so, here is what we are doing. \r\n\r\nStep1: For every HoodieWriteStat in the HoodieCommitMetadata, we are generating PerFileGroupRecordKeyInfos which contains \r\n - a boolean flag to denote whether the file group of interest contains pure inserts. \r\n - and List <RecordKeyInfo>. RecordKeyInfo is a POJO containing below items \r\n - \r\n ```\r\n  private final String recordKey;\r\n  private final RecordStatus recordStatus;\r\n  private String partition;\r\n  private String fileId;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nwhere RecordStatus is an enum with INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE\r\n\r\nIncase of parquet file: \r\n- if previous base file is present, we read both old and new and generate PerFileGroupRecordKeyInfos. If only RLI is enabled, we do some optimizations here as we don't really need to differentiate insert/updates in latest parquet file. \r\nIncase of log files: \r\n- For regular data blocks, we populate values only if both RLI and SI are enabled. If only RLI is enabled, we don't need to process data blocks as RLI only cares about inserts and deletes. \r\n- Incase of delete blocks, we read them and and populate values for List <RecordKeyInfo> in PerFileGroupRecordKeyInfos. \r\n\r\nStep2: \r\nPersist the output from Step1. (PairRDD)\r\n\r\nStep 3:\r\n- We use the output from Step2 and generate RLI records. \r\n\r\nStep4: \r\n- We use the output from Step 2 and generate SI records. Here we only poll the PerFileGroupRecordKeyInfos to understand the record keys that have been deleted or updated. \r\n- We still have code snippets here to read directly from data files for SI purpose. This might be taking up in a separate patch (as it might increase the scope of the patch)\r\n\r\nEssentially, at a high level, we do one processing of data files to populate PerFileGroupRecordKeyInfos for every HoodieWriteStat (i.e. every partition, fileId combination). \r\nAnd then use the paired RDD to compute RLI and SI records. \r\n\r\nPending: \r\nI need to write more tests. But most of existing tests for RLI and SI except 1 which I am investigating.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo non-determinism or undefined behavior for RLI and SI is fixed. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor overwrite related write operations like insert overwrite, insert overwrite table and delete partition operations we need to throw an error indicating that secondary index update is not supported with these operations.\r\nWe would be adding the support of such operations in a separate jira. Currently the user would need to drop and recreate the index after the operation.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nINSERT_OVERWRITE, INSERT_OVERWRITE_TABLE and DELETE_PARTITION would throw error if secondary index is enabled\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nINSERT_OVERWRITE, INSERT_OVERWRITE_TABLE and DELETE_PARTITION would throw error if secondary index is enabled. Index needs to be dropped and recreated after the operation\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter spark3.3 support TimeTravel SQL and Logical Plan, remove the implementation in hudi, remain `index` DML SQL\r\n\r\ncode detail:\r\nbefore spark3.3, spark not support timetravel sql, so hudi supports the full DQL query syntax for timetravel.\r\nnow, we remove it, therefore, a large portion of the DQL syntax parsing will not be used; we only need to support Hudi's custom implementation of the DDL syntax related to indexing.\r\n\r\ng4 file\r\n- delete `queryStatement` `dmlStatement` `createTable` in HoodieSqlBase.g4, it's for timetravel\r\n- delete SqlBase.g4 file, copy which `index` need.\r\n\r\nastBuilder\r\n- delete a large amount of redundant implementations and retain only those related to indexing\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nin spark, TIMESTAMP dataType is  `TimestampType`, VERSION is `String`. And the hoodie instance time format is not legal for spark to parse. \r\nAnd from the perspective of usage, the concept of HUDI's timestamp concept is more suitable for using VERSION, so in this pr:\r\n- VERSION AS OF\r\n  - support digit string, contain hudi base timeline format - [yyyyMMddhhmmssSSS], will return less or equal snapshots\r\n- TIMSTAMP AS OF\r\n  - spark provides a rich date expression, will return less or equal snapshots\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nspark Time Travel Query tutorial, update \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-17T13:55:18Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T03:33:12Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"jonvex","id":26940621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQwNjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26940621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex","html_url":"https://github.com/jonvex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jonvex","id":26940621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQwNjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26940621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex","html_url":"https://github.com/jonvex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonvex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3382222382,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM7JmJ4u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark-sql","name":"spark-sql","color":"5BAEBC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRLI record preparation for MDT has been relying on RDD<WriteStatus>. We are removing the dependency in this patch to generate it on the fly to ensure RLI updates are resilient to task/stage retries with spark. \r\nWill update the PR desc w/ more details on the design shortly.\r\n\r\nCurrent design of RLI prior to this fix: \r\n\r\n![mdt_dag1_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c5b846b-b8f3-4cc9-a781-dadb1cc6bfd1)\r\n![mdt_dag1_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69165a4-207b-4fd8-ba6c-1f2a753f4645)\r\n\r\n\r\nRoot cause for the potential inconsistencies:\r\nMajor point of concern here is that, for preparing MDT records for some of the partitions, we are relying in RDD<WriteStatus>. All other partitions in MDT is relying on HoodieCommitMetadata which is in driver's memory, but RLI is relying on RDD<WriteStatus> which could be recomputed again when a subset of spark partition goes missing. \r\n\r\nProposal to fix the inconsistencies: \r\nSo, our proposal targets to avoid the reliance on the RDD<WriteStatus> on a high level. We are choosing consistency over performance for the time. Eventually we wanted to consider a full streaming way of generating MDT records (ref draft patch [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236)) We might come back post 1.0 release to revisit the full dag rewrite for sure, since its more streaming friendly and we have to take that route eventually to support minute level commits w/ numerous indexes being added to our indexing sub system.\r\n\r\nDesign \r\nOnce we trigger DT writes via collect() to fetch List<HoodieWriteStat>, all of downstream computation will never look up the RDD<WriteStatus> for any MDT record preparation. For RLI and Secondary index, we will do on-demand read of the data files to fetch the required info to prepare MDT records for these partitions. Here is the illustration of the design.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"828\" alt=\"image (13)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f3a038-c43a-4564-bf88-2bfb2e9d8182\">\r\n\r\nSo, for RLI and Secondary index, we will be doing on-demand read of data files to fetch the necessary info to assist with preparing MDT records. With this design change, our entire record generation for RLI and Secondary index will be resilient to spark task retries. Infact, we trigger the collect() just once for the data table and so, post collecting() the writeStatus/HoodieWriteStats in data table, no downstream caller will ever try to dereference the dag and so there is no chance of inconsistencies. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, we will focus only in RLI. We will work on a follow up patch for SI. \r\n\r\nSo, lets try to understand what info do we need and how to fetch it. \r\n\r\nFor RLI, we need below info \r\nFor every file group that got touched, we need the following:\r\n- newly inserted record keys ➝ fileGroup ID\r\n- delete record keys ➝ fileGroup ID. \r\n\r\nFor now, lets dive into details on how we plan to get the required info. \r\n\r\nHow do we fetch the required info for a given file group being touched in the current commit of interest:\r\na. We need to read the latest image of the file slice added as part of the current commit. \r\nb. Optionally we need to read the previous image of the file slice or previous file slice (excluding the files being added as part of current commit). \r\nFind the difference b/w (a) and (b) to fetch the required info for both indexes. \r\n\r\nReason for (b) being optional is : \r\nIf new file being considered, consists of purely of inserts or updates, we don't even need to look up the previous version of the file slice. Note that, HoodieWriteStat will give us the info about numInserts, numUpdates and numDeletes and we can rely on that to deduce it.\r\n\r\nLets understand what refers to \"previous image of the file slice\": \r\nEssentially its the latest file slice excluding the file being added in the current commit. \r\nIncase of COW table, if a new base file is added to an existing file group, \"previous image of the file slice\" refers to the previous file slice(i.e the previous base file). This also applies for compaction in case of MOR table. \r\nDegenerative case: Incase of a new base file added to a new file group, there is no \"previous image of the file slice\". Every record is an insert in this case. \r\nIncase of a new log file added to an existing file slice, \"previous image of the file slice\" refers to the file slice excluding the log file. \r\n\r\nComputing the record key ➝ fileId mapping differs for base file vs log file. Lets take a look at each of them.\r\n\r\nBase file record key mapping computation:\r\nRLI:\r\n- If adding a new base file for an existing file group, we read record keys from previous base file and the new one to find the new inserts and deletes. \r\n- If its a new base file for a new file group, we read the record keys from the new base file and add them to RLI. \r\nIncase of Compaction, we do not send any updates to RLI. \r\n\r\nLog files record key mapping computation:\r\nRLI is an index, where we can't have inserts to log files. So, we can completely ignore reading any log files w/ data blocks only. In other words, log files w/ data blocks can only contain updates. But still, some payload implementation could realize deletes via custom implementation which may be seen as updates. So, to account for those cases, we can let the next compaction take care of realizing the deletes from the file group of interest. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, if we have log files added to commit of interest: \r\nfor RLI since inserts cannot go into log files: \r\n- log files w/ data blocks: we can ignore processing them. Whenever compaction kicks in for the file slice of interest, we will ensure deleted records are brought to sync w/ RLI (if not added to delete blocks). \r\n- log files / delete blocks: We just read the record keys from the delete log block and generate records for RLI. \r\n\r\n\r\nLets skim through every operation:\r\n- Regular core operations like bulk_insert, insert, upsert and delete will follow the above logic. \r\n- Incase of compaction, we have called out above. \r\n- For clustering, everything is a new insert since FG ID changes. (updates RLI)\r\n- For insert_overwrite: We fetch the list of replaced files from HoodieReplaceCommitMetadata to find the record keys to be deleted from RLI. Also, for new files that were added, we will do on-demand read of base files and create new insert records to RLI. \r\n- For insert overwrite table: we simplified this operation by re-creating the MDT fully.\r\n- For Delete partition: Pretty similar to insert_overwrite, just that we may not have any new records to ingest to RLI, we will only delete records from RLI. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRobust RLI updates even w/ spark task retries. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMultiple secondary indexes (or functional index) exist in different partitions but still we use the same file id prefix. So, thre is a chance of collision in the append handle when two different secondary index have same file id prefix and same shard. This PR fixes the file id prefix in such a case. Added updates to the existing test case which creates multiple secondary index.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix updates with multiple secondary indexes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMultiple secondary indexes (or functional index) exist in different partitions but still we use the same file id prefix. So, thre is a chance of collision in the append handle when two different secondary index have same file id prefix and same shard. This PR fixes the file id prefix in such a case. Added updates to the existing test case which creates multiple secondary index.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix updates with multiple secondary indexes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\nonly affects sec index and func index.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.
