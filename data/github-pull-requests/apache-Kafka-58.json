Prior to this PR, the `openIterators` list was passed into the constructor for the iterators themselves, allowing `RocksDbIterator.close()` to remove the iterator from the `openIterators` list. After this PR, the iterators themselves will not know about lists of open iterators. Instead, a generic close callback is exposed, and it's the responsibility of the store that creates a new iterator to set the callback on the iterator, to ensure that closing an iterator removes the iterator from the list of open iterators.\r\n\r\nThis refactor is desirable because it enables more flexible iterator lifecycle management. Building on top of this, RocksDBStore is updated with an option to allow the user (i.e., the caller of methods such as `range()` and `prefixScan()` which return iterators) to pass a custom `openIterators` list for the new iterator to be stored in. This will allow for a new Segments implementation where multiple Segments can share the same RocksDBStore instance, while having each Segment manage its own open iterators. (See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13143 for more.)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

patch contains a few cleanups and fixes in the new refactored consumer logic:\r\n\r\n- Use `CompletableFuture` instead of `RequestFuture` in `NetworkClientDelegate`. This is a much more extensible API and it avoids tying the new implementation to `ConsumerNetworkClient`.\r\n- Fix call to `isReady` in `NetworkClientDelegate`. We need the call to `ready` to initiate the connection.\r\n- Ensure backoff is enforced even after successful `FindCoordinator` requests. This avoids a tight loop while metadata is converging after a coordinator change.\r\n- `RequestState` was incorrectly using the reconnect backoff as the retry backoff. In fact, we don't currently have a retry backoff max implemented in the consumer, so the use of `ExponentialBackoff` is unnecessary, but I've left it since we may add this with https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-580%3A+Exponential+Backoff+for+Kafka+Clients. \r\n- Minor cleanups in test cases to avoid unused classes/fields.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T19:01:48Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T20:45:25Z","closed_at":"2023-01-23T20:45:24Z","merged_at":"2023-01-23T20:45:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2cb546fba03bbdc4054c7d120b0b2654c7cf34e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bc26b2844a18520c1844e826b93497090d27717c","head":{"label":"hachikuji:refactor-network-client-future-usage","ref":"refactor-network-client-future-usage","sha":"bc26b2844a18520c1844e826b93497090d27717c","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

described in [KIP-710](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-710%3A+Full+support+for+distributed+mode+in+dedicated+MirrorMaker+2.0+clusters).\r\n\r\nA lot of the diff here comes from shuffling existing parts of the code base into new parts, without significantly altering them. This is necessary in order to make the current REST API logic for Kafka Connect more extensible and reusable, which in turn allows us to add logic for the dedicated Mirror Maker 2 REST API with less effort.\r\n\r\nShuffled but not extensively rewritten portions include:\r\n- `WorkerConfig` properties being extracted into the new `RestServerConfig` class\r\n- Pulling out some REST forwarding logic previously internal to the `ConnectorsResource` class into the new `HerderRequestHandler` class\r\n- Pulling out all REST logic for internal endpoints from the `ConnectorsResource` class into the new `InternalClusterResource` class\r\n\r\nThese changes should not affect the docs generated by, e.g., the `DistributedConfig` class, but should allow other `AbstractConfig` classes to easily add properties related to the (public- or internal-facing) Connect REST API.\r\n\r\nAn integration test is also added that runs a multi-node, dedicated Mirror Maker 2 cluster with exactly-once support enabled in order to test out both code paths related to intra-cluster communication.","created_at":"2023-01-20T18:46:38Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T16:00:31Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T15:50:08Z","merged_at":"2023-02-09T15:50:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"f93d5af8392e01f29b853cc44c6f78d74ead41be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

covers two JIRAs https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14632 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14633 \r\n\r\n## Background \r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-19 at 18 27 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/213521204-bb3228ed-7d21-4e07-a520-697ea6fcc0ed.png)\r\nCurrently, we use 2 intermediate buffers while handling decompressed data (one of size 2KB and another of size 16KB). These buffers are (de)allocated once per batch. The decompressed data is first copied to a 16KB buffer and then again copied in chunks to a 2KB buffer.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this was observed in a flamegraph analysis for a compressed workload where we observed that 75% of CPU during `appendAsLeader()` is taken up by `ValidateMessagesAndAssignOffsets`.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 10 41 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/213664252-389eaf3d-b8aa-465b-b010-db1024663d6f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change\r\nWith this PR:\r\n1. Introduced `ChunkedDataInputStream`. This is a customized implementation of `BufferedInputStream` and the javadoc for these classes mention why a custom stream was required.\r\n2. We are removing the number of intermediate buffers from 2 to 1. This reduces 1 point of data copy.  This is achieved by getting rid of `BufferedInputStream` and replacing with `ChunkedDataInputStream`.\r\n3. We are using thread local buffer pool for both the buffers involved in the process of decompression. \r\n\r\nAfter the change, the above buffer allocation looks as follows:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 11 45 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/234538028-8055db23-098b-4963-9d66-8de357b21a1a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nAfter this change, \r\n\r\n1. For broker side decompression: JMH benchmark `RecordBatchIterationBenchmark` demonstrates 20-70% improvement in throughput (see results for `RecordBatchIterationBenchmark.measureSkipIteratorForVariableBatchSize`). \r\n2. For consumer side decompression: JMH benchmark `RecordBatchIterationBenchmark` a mix bag of single digit regression for some compression type to 10-50% improvement for Zstd (see results for `RecordBatchIterationBenchmark.measureStreamingIteratorForVariableBatchSize`). \r\n\r\nThe reason that we don't see equivalent gains in consumer is because it copies all uncompressed data in a single buffer and then reads off it. We have not reduced any buffer allocation for consumer scenario(since we have only removed the \"skiparray\" used by skipIterator). There are potential opportunities to improve consumer side decompression but we will address that in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nDetails results from JMH benchmark for `RecordBatchIterationBenchmark` are available here: \r\n[benchmark-jira.xlsx](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13057619/benchmark-jira%20%285%29.xlsx)\r\n\r\n**Before & after object allocation captured in

compression types.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T09:43:47Z","updated_at":"2023-06-05T07:04:49Z","closed_at":"2023-06-05T07:04:49Z","merged_at":"2023-06-05T07:04:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe6a827e20d30af5328d7376a831f9666e0c8110","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f5660171d9ab38c92cf3d53752658f8405eee0f2","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:optimize-compression-pr","ref":"optimize-compression-pr","sha":"f5660171d9ab38c92cf3d53752658f8405eee0f2","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

is a good practice to always define a root project name. However, this change is specifically being made to address a build caching miss as a result of not having the root project name defined.\r\n\r\nThe `aggregatedJavadoc` task takes in the root project name as an input. When executing the build from two uniquely named directories, we will see the second execution of `aggregatedJavadoc` will be re-executed due to computed build cache key being different.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the contents of the Gradle local build cache with `rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1`. WARNING: This is a destructive action, consider renaming the directory instead if you need to preserve the local build cache.\r\n2. Clone and execute the project with `git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:apache/kafka.git first_build && (cd first_build && ./gradlew aggregatedJavadoc --build-cache)`.\r\n3. Clone and execute the project again with `git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:apache/kafka.git second_build && (cd second_build && ./gradlew aggregatedJavadoc --build-cache --scan)`.\r\n4. Agree to the Gradle Terms of Service when prompted to publish a Build Scan.\r\n5. We can see on the Performance > Task execution screen that [a cacheable task](https://scans.gradle.com/s/7bnq7gb4ykmdk/timeline?cacheability=cacheable&hide-timeline&outcome=success,failed&sort=longest) has been executed. We can click the Cacheable link to find [the culprit](https://scans.gradle.com/s/7bnq7gb4ykmdk/timeline?cacheability=cacheable&hide-timeline&outcome=success,failed&sort=longest#lhlgorbepbsx4).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation\r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade

proposed the introduction of versioned key-value stores, as well as a RocksDB-based implementation. The RocksDB implementation will consist of a \"latest value store\" for storing the latest record version associated with each key, in addition to multiple \"segment stores\" to store older record versions. Within a segment store, multiple record versions for the same key will be combined into a single bytes array \"value\" associated with the key and stored to RocksDB. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the utility class that will be used to manage the value format of these segment stores, i.e., how multiple record versions for the same key will be combined into a single bytes array \"value.\" Follow-up

Change\r\nController should update Zk with locally cached TopicId (when available) instead of assigning a new one when Zk doesn't have a TopicId.\r\n\r\n## Motivation for this change\r\nThis problem was highlighted in KAFKA-14190 and since then, multiple users have complained about the problem [HERE](https://lists.apache.org/thread/jzk4tyd1xs1wwj0bpkdnxpw0m152qw1f) (mailing list), [HERE](https://lists.apache.org/thread/4rqrd6kqd0nrc248fv1tmdn0088947hv) (mailing list) and [HERE](https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/CE7HWJPHA/p1671529649633529) (ASF slack channel).\r\n\r\n## Description of the problem\r\nIn certain situations, it is possible that the TopicId stored locally on a broker for a topic differs from the topicId stored for that topic on Zk. Currently, such situation arises when users use a <2.8 client to alterPartitions for a topic on a >=2.8 (including latest 3.4) brokers AND they use `--zookeeper` flag from the client. Note that `--zookeeper` has been marked deprecated for a long time and has been replaced by `--bootstrap-server` which doesn't face this problem.\r\n\r\nThe result of topic Id discrepancy leads to availability loss for the topic until user performs the mitigation steps listed in  KAFKA-14190.\r\n\r\nThe exact sequence of steps are:\r\n\r\n1. User uses pre 2.8 client to create a new topic in zookeeper directly\r\n2. No TopicId is generated in Zookeeper\r\n3. KafkaController listens to the ZNode, and a `TopicChange` event is created, During handling on this event, controller notices that there is no TopicId, it generated a new one and updates Zk.\r\n4. At this stage, Zk has a TopicId.\r\n5. User uses pre 2.8 client to increase the number of partitions for this topic\r\n6. The client will replace/overwrite the entire existing Znode with new placement information. **This will delete the existing TopicId in Zk (that was created by controller in step 3).**\r\n7. Next time KafkaController interacts with this ZNode, it will generate a new TopicId.\r\n8. Note that we now have two different TopicIds for this topic name.\r\n9. Broker may have a different topicId (older one) in metadata file and will complain about the mismatch when they encounter a new TopicId.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1. I have added a test with this change which asserts that TopicId for a topic is immutable i.e. once assigned, it does not change. This test fails before this change and passes after this change.\r\n\r\n2. All integration tests and unit tests have been successful for me locally.\r\n\r\n## Side effects of this fix\r\nThere are no additional side effects of this change. No additional calls to Zk. We are only updating the TopicId from a locally cached value instead of assigning a new one.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\nThis code change does not fix the problem completely. The code change assumes that controller would have the TopicId locally so that it can update Zk but situations such as controller failover, that may not be true. More specifically, we will still end up having two different topic Ids in cases when controller failover takes place between the time when Zk TopicID was overwritten/removed and time when controller could update the TopicId with local value.\r\n\r\nHowever, this code change should fix majority of the scenario that are impacted by this bug and a separate PR would be filed to fix the minority scenarios of controller failover during the exact duration.\r\n\r\n## Release\r\nDue to the simple nature of the fix and the number of users who are impacted, I would request to consider adding this to 3.4.0 and backporting to as many previous version as we can.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-13T12:47:32Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T19:26:51Z","closed_at":"2024-10-15T19:26:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

Failing to do so causes \"stray\" replicas which take up disk space and can cause topicId conflicts if the topic is later recreated. Currently, this logic does not work because the leader epoch does not always get bumped after cancellation. Without a leader epoch bump, the replica will ignore `StopReplica` requests sent by the controller and the replica may remain online.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we fix the problem by loosening the epoch check on the broker side when a `StopReplica` request is received. Instead of ignoring the request when the request epoch matches the current epoch, the request will be accepted. \r\n\r\nNote, this problem only affects the ZK controller. The integration tests added here nevertheless cover both metadata modes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14612\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nMakes sure we emit `ConfigRecord`s for a topic iff it actually gets created. Currently, we might emit `ConfigRecord`s even if the topic creation fails later in the `createTopics` method.\r\n\r\nI created a new method `incrementalAlterConfig` in `ConfigurationControlManager` that is similar to `incrementalAlterConfig` but it just handles one config at a time. This is used in `ReplicationControlManager` for each topic. By handling one topic's config at a time, it's easier to isolate each topic's config records. This enables us to make sure we only write config records for topics that get created.\r\n\r\nI refactored `incrementalAlterConfigResource` to return an `ApiError`. This made it easier to implement the new method `incrementalAlterConfig` in `ConfigurationControlManager` because it then doesnt have to search in the `Map` for the result.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nEnhanced pre-existing test `ReplicationControlManagerTest.testCreateTopicsWithConfigs`. I ran the tests without the changes to `ReplicationControlManager` and made sure each assertion ends up failing. Also ran `./gradlew metadata:test --tests org.apache.kafka.controller.ReplicationControlManagerTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-10T21:42:55Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T00:23:58Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T00:23:58Z","merged_at":"2023-01-13T00:23:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d9a7022a4486e08dc4bd71e2fd7632ecdd3b76f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4b0b4a38aa491d5f17c79125a6b8f0bf6f611594","head":{"label":"andymg3:KAFKA-14612","ref":"KAFKA-14612","sha":"4b0b4a38aa491d5f17c79125a6b8f0bf6f611594","user":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":475882650,"node_id":"R_kgDOHF1kmg","name":"kafka","full_name":"andymg3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3/kafka","description":"Mirror

the new broker epoch validation logic introduced in #12998, we no longer need the ZK broker epoch to be sent to the KRaft controller. This patch removes that epoch and replaces it with a boolean.\r\n\r\nAnother small fix is included in this patch for controlled shutdown in migration mode. Previously, if a ZK broker was in migration mode, it would always try to do controlled shutdown via BrokerLifecycleManager. Since there is no ordering dependency between bringing up ZK brokers and the KRaft quorum during migration, a ZK broker could be running in migration mode, but talking to a ZK controller. A small check was added to see if the current controller is ZK or KRaft before decided which controlled shutdown to attempt.","created_at":"2023-01-10T20:38:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T19:36:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-11T19:36:56Z","merged_at":"2023-01-11T19:36:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"0bb05d8679b684ad8fbb2eb40dfc00066186a75a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8e860e5493e151c73464954fc95411bd4b37c100","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-14304","ref":"KAFKA-14304","sha":"8e860e5493e151c73464954fc95411bd4b37c100","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

Replace BrokerMetadataListener with MetadataLoader\r\n\r\nReplace BrokerMetadataListener with MetadataLoader. BrokerMetadataListener was, in a sense, an\r\nearly prototype of MetadataLoader.It constructed a MetadataImage object from records supplied by\r\nthe raft layer.\r\n\r\nMetadataLoader is a rewrite of this code with several improvements.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoadder is in Java, and not part of the core gradle module.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoadder is not broker-specific. This is especially useful in combined mode where it means\r\n  we do not have to have a separate, controller-specific code path for creating MetadataImage\r\n  objects.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoader supports multiple publishers rather than a single publisher.\r\n\r\n- Publisher can be dynamically added and removed from MetadataLoader.","created_at":"2023-01-10T00:42:46Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T20:46:38Z","closed_at":"2023-03-05T20:46:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69c9a27eaf97b4427b89b0dbdc40afd90e50f172","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1f914cae888c8dcc11225a8ce1ac369413009691","head":{"label":"cmccabe:remove-bml","ref":"remove-bml","sha":"1f914cae888c8dcc11225a8ce1ac369413009691","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

were some concurrency inconsistencies in `KafkaScheduler` flagged by spotBugs\r\nthat had to be fixed, summary of changes below:\r\n* Executor is `volatile`\r\n* We always synchronize and check `isStarted` as the first thing within the critical\r\n   section when a mutating operation is performed.\r\n* We don't synchronize (but ensure the executor is not null in a safe way) in read-only\r\n   operations that operate on the executor.\r\n\r\nWith regards to `MockScheduler/MockTask`:\r\n* Set the type of `nextExecution` to `AtomicLong` and replaced inconsistent synchronization\r\n* Extracted logic into `MockTask.rescheduleIfPeriodic`\r\n\r\nTweaked the `Scheduler` interface a bit:\r\n* Removed `unit` parameter since we always used `ms` except one invocation\r\n* Introduced a couple of `scheduleOnce` overloads to replace the usage of default\r\n   arguments in Scala\r\n* Pulled up `resizeThreadPool` to the interface and removed `isStarted` from the\r\n  interface.\r\n\r\nOther cleanups:\r\n* Removed spotBugs exclusion affecting `kafka.log.LogConfig`, which no longer exists.\r\n\r\nFor broader context, see:\r\n* KAFKA-14470: Move log layer to storage module\r\n\r\n###

ACL change methods (create, delete) are eventually consistent across a Kafka cluster. As part of that, changes to the same resource made to different brokers may be reordered. In this test, a delete operation initiated in noConsumeWithoutDescribeAclSetup was being reordered to an unexpected time later in the test, causing an expected ACL to be missing.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, add a wait condition that asserts that the delete operations initiated in noConsumeWithoutDescribeAclSetup are completely applied before returning from the method.\r\n\r\nNote: test failures were present for both the ZK and KRAFT iterations of the test, but the ZK iteration encountered it much more often, and was used to diagnose the reordering.\r\n\r\nThis is a typo in the original implementation of this method in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1908/files#diff-c38532e2fcf5cce4cf30a824bc6bef9953c05d9472db51c3778a0286f6f01296R311 . And was made worse when the CREATE acl was added but never deleted: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4795/files#diff-c38532e2fcf5cce4cf30a824bc6bef9953c05d9472db51c3778a0286f6f01296R293-R308 .\r\nHowever, I don't think that this became flakey until https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12843 which replaced the AclCommand with the AdminClient, and removed the synchronization to wait for the ACL operation to resolve before proceeding with the test.\r\n\r\nThis does not require a change to the ACL mechanisms, as I believe the reordering is an expected part of the consistency algorithm, which includes a CAS operation to ZK. This is also not a security risk, as this only affects successful ACL change operations, and should not allow unsuccessful ACL change operations to insert invalid ACLs.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Greg

change preserves the instance of the CallbackHandler that was used to login into Kerberos and passes it to the LoginContext when TGT needs to be renewed. \r\n\r\nThe change is tested in DIT with live Kafka and AD KRB instances in our current project.","created_at":"2023-01-05T19:28:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-27T03:37:56Z","closed_at":"2024-12-27T03:37:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"055f61ac760565c5eacea905097312593fae1463","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

above error (on V2 message format). Also, the error can be reproduced easily on V1 since there is no epoch cache.  The ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread checks the offset of “future log” rather than “log. Hence, here is my two cents, we can replace log.highWatermark by futureLog.highWatermark to resolve this issue. I tested it on our cluster and it works well (on both V1 and V2).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

a controller role will fail if no log.dirs are specified. This is caused by KafkaRaftServer as it merges the configs in log.dirs and metadata.log.dir. If the paths in log.dirs weren't initialized with storage-tool when the process fails. This is unwanted as controller only roles don't need log.dirs.\r\n\r\nThis fix attempts to fix that by not merging the two configs, only if the process has both broker and controller roles.\r\n\r\n###

PR provides an implementation of KIP-847 (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-847%3A+Add+ProducerIdCount+metrics). As far as I can tell, the original author @artemlivshits has not provided a pull request since the KIP was approved so I took the liberty of picking it up. Of course, if they provide a pull request I am happy to close this one.\r\n\r\nI do not understand why the metric ought to be surfaced from `kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=ProducerIdCount` when the information is stored in `ProducerStateManager`. I have thus taken the further liberty of surfacing the metric from `ProducerStateManager` directly under `kafka.log:type=ProducerStateManager,name=ProducerIdCount`. I am happy to revise this given the feedback or if this is accepted to update the KIP.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nGrafana dashboard showing ProducerIdCount increasing when adding idempotent producers and decreasing whenever the the producer ids expire: https://g-576b9cd7b5.grafana-workspace.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboard/snapshot/U5NfIDaMlm0VTIvmF4ZHJio7Kwuc1pTk\r\n\r\nI do not know whether we carry out any unit/integration testing upon addition of new metrics, but if I am pointed to similar test cases I am happy to revise this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-03T14:21:43Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T06:20:00Z","closed_at":"2023-01-08T06:19:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2476e78deb9b7d563337fae22a6783368a9423b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

When the metadata log dir is different from the log dir(s). The current implementation of LogManager doesn't load or grab a lock on the metadata dir.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-
