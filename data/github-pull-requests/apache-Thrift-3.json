(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nThe routine _bio_get_fd_ checks for the validity of a file descriptor by comparing the fd to be less\r\nthan or equal to zero. The issue is that fd of 0 is a valid file descriptor. This PR changes the check\r\nto be less than zero.  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nWhen serializing and deserializing Enums for Structs, the current code expects Enum member variables to be a string instead of an Enum. What this means is that the thrift file shows that an Enum is passed in the struct, when actually a string is passed in. This is very confusing can arbitrarily lead to KeyError in the deserialization logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, changing this behavior is potentially breaking. To avoid breaking existing users, check if the type is an Enum when setting the member variable and convert the type to an Enum if it is a string. This allows the actual type to be an Enum and simplifies the serialization/deserialization logic to use Enums instead of converting strings.\r\n\r\nGiven a thrift file like the following:\r\n```python\r\nenum TestEnum {\r\n  TestEnum0 = 0,\r\n  TestEnum1 = 1,\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct TestStruct {\r\n    1: optional string param1\r\n    2: optional TestEnum param2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is how you would create a struct before and after the change but both are valid.\r\n```python\r\n# Before\r\nTestStruct(param1=\"test_string\", param2=TestEnum.TestEnum1.name) # or pass in \"TestEnum1\"\r\n\r\n# After\r\nTestStruct(param1=\"test_string\", param2=TestEnum.TestEnum1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSerialization/Deserialization Code Change Example- \r\n```python\r\nclass TestStruct(object):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Attributes:\r\n     - param1\r\n     - param2\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, param1=None, param2=None,):\r\n        self.param1 = param1\r\n        self.param2 = param2\r\n\r\n++    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\r\n++\t\tif name == \"param2\":\r\n++\t        super().__setattr__(name, value if hasattr(value, 'value') else TestEnum.__members__.get(value))\r\n++\t\t\treturn\r\n++        super().__setattr__(name, value)\r\n\r\n    def read(self, iprot):\r\n        if iprot._fast_decode is not None and isinstance(iprot.trans, TTransport.CReadableTransport) and self.thrift_spec is not None:\r\n            iprot._fast_decode(self, iprot, [self.__class__, self.thrift_spec])\r\n            return\r\n        iprot.readStructBegin()\r\n        while True:\r\n            (fname, ftype, fid) = iprot.readFieldBegin()\r\n            if ftype == TType.STOP:\r\n                break\r\n            if fid == 1:\r\n                if ftype == TType.STRING:\r\n                    self.param1 = iprot.readString().decode('utf-8', errors='replace') if sys.version_info[0] == 2 else iprot.readString()\r\n                else:\r\n                    iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            elif fid == 2:\r\n                if ftype == TType.I32:\r\n--                    self.param2 = TestEnum(iprot.readI32()).name\r\n++                    self.param2 = TestEnum(iprot.readI32())\r\n                else:\r\n                    iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            else:\r\n                iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            iprot.readFieldEnd()\r\n        iprot.readStructEnd()\r\n\r\n    def write(self, oprot):\r\n        if oprot._fast_encode is not None and self.thrift_spec is not None:\r\n            oprot.trans.write(oprot._fast_encode(self, [self.__class__, self.thrift_spec]))\r\n            return\r\n        oprot.writeStructBegin('TestStruct')\r\n        if self.param1 is not None:\r\n            oprot.writeFieldBegin('param1', TType.STRING, 1)\r\n            oprot.writeString(self.param1.encode('utf-8') if sys.version_info[0] == 2 else self.param1)\r\n            oprot.writeFieldEnd()\r\n        if self.param2 is not None:\r\n            oprot.writeFieldBegin('param2', TType.I32, 2)\r\n--            oprot.writeI32(TestEnum[self.param2].value)\r\n++           oprot.writeI32(self.param2.value)\r\n            oprot.writeFieldEnd()\r\n        oprot.writeFieldStop()\r\n        oprot.writeStructEnd()\r\n\r\n    def validate(self):\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        L = ['%s=%r' % (key, value)\r\n             for key, value in self.__dict__.items()]\r\n        return '%s(%s)' % (self.__class__.__name__, ', '.join(L))\r\n\r\n    def __eq__(self, other):\r\n        return isinstance(other, self.__class__) and self.__dict__ == other.__dict__\r\n\r\n    def __ne__(self, other):\r\n        return not (self == other)\r\nall_structs.append(TestStruct)\r\nTestStruct.thrift_spec = (\r\n    None,  # 0\r\n    (1, TType.STRING, 'param1', 'UTF8', None, ),  # 1\r\n    (2, TType.I32, 'param2', None, None, ),  # 2\r\n)\r\nfix_spec(all_structs)\r\ndel all_structs\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nWhen serializing and deserializing Enums for Structs, we convert the Enum to a string instead of keeping it as an Enum. What this means is that the thrift file shows that an Enum is passed in the struct, when actually a string is passed in. This is very confusing can arbitrarily lead to KeyError and in the deserialization logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, changing this behavior is potentially breaking. To avoid breaking existing users, check if the type is an Enum by using the `hasattr` check to see if type has attribute value. If so, parse as an enum. Otherwise parse as a string.\r\n\r\nGiven a thrift file like the following:\r\n```python\r\nenum TestEnum {\r\n  TestEnum0 = 0,\r\n  TestEnum1 = 1,\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct TestStruct {\r\n    1: optional string param1\r\n    2: optional TestEnum param2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis is how you would create a struct before and after the change but both are valid.\r\n```python\r\n# Before\r\nTestStruct(param1=\"test_string\", param2=TestEnum.TestEnum1.name) # or pass in \"TestEnum1\"\r\n\r\n# After\r\nTestStruct(param1=\"test_string\", param2=TestEnum.TestEnum1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSerialization/Deserialization Code Change Example- \r\n```python\r\nclass TestStruct(object):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Attributes:\r\n     - param1\r\n     - param2\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, param1=None, param2=None,):\r\n        self.param1 = param1\r\n        self.param2 = param2\r\n\r\n    def read(self, iprot):\r\n        if iprot._fast_decode is not None and isinstance(iprot.trans, TTransport.CReadableTransport) and self.thrift_spec is not None:\r\n            iprot._fast_decode(self, iprot, [self.__class__, self.thrift_spec])\r\n            return\r\n        iprot.readStructBegin()\r\n        while True:\r\n            (fname, ftype, fid) = iprot.readFieldBegin()\r\n            if ftype == TType.STOP:\r\n                break\r\n            if fid == 1:\r\n                if ftype == TType.STRING:\r\n                    self.param1 = iprot.readString().decode('utf-8', errors='replace') if sys.version_info[0] == 2 else iprot.readString()\r\n                else:\r\n                    iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            elif fid == 2:\r\n                if ftype == TType.I32:\r\n--                    self.param2 = TestEnum(iprot.readI32()).name\r\n++                    self.param2 = TestEnum(iprot.readI32())\r\n                else:\r\n                    iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            else:\r\n                iprot.skip(ftype)\r\n            iprot.readFieldEnd()\r\n        iprot.readStructEnd()\r\n\r\n    def write(self, oprot):\r\n        if oprot._fast_encode is not None and self.thrift_spec is not None:\r\n            oprot.trans.write(oprot._fast_encode(self, [self.__class__, self.thrift_spec]))\r\n            return\r\n        oprot.writeStructBegin('TestStruct')\r\n        if self.param1 is not None:\r\n            oprot.writeFieldBegin('param1', TType.STRING, 1)\r\n            oprot.writeString(self.param1.encode('utf-8') if sys.version_info[0] == 2 else self.param1)\r\n            oprot.writeFieldEnd()\r\n        if self.param2 is not None:\r\n            oprot.writeFieldBegin('param2', TType.I32, 2)\r\n--            oprot.writeI32(TestEnum[self.param2].value)\r\n++           oprot.writeI32(self.param2.value if hasattr(self.param2, 'value') else TestEnum[self.param2].value)\r\n            oprot.writeFieldEnd()\r\n        oprot.writeFieldStop()\r\n        oprot.writeStructEnd()\r\n\r\n    def validate(self):\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    def __repr__(self):\r\n        L = ['%s=%r' % (key, value)\r\n             for key, value in self.__dict__.items()]\r\n        return '%s(%s)' % (self.__class__.__name__, ', '.join(L))\r\n\r\n    def __eq__(self, other):\r\n        return isinstance(other, self.__class__) and self.__dict__ == other.__dict__\r\n\r\n    def __ne__(self, other):\r\n        return not (self == other)\r\nall_structs.append(TestStruct)\r\nTestStruct.thrift_spec = (\r\n    None,  # 0\r\n    (1, TType.STRING, 'param1', 'UTF8', None, ),  # 1\r\n    (2, TType.I32, 'param2', None, None, ),  # 2\r\n)\r\nfix_spec(all_structs)\r\ndel all_structs\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nIn Python, when using map with enums, the generated code would not output the full path for the enum that was defined in a separate file. This change outputs the full path for the type so that the generated code is correct.\r\n\r\nThere is a test case the shows the code is properly generated.\r\n\r\nPreviously the code would output this - \r\n```python\r\nfrom thrift.Thrift import TType, TMessageType, TFrozenDict, TException, TApplicationException\r\nfrom thrift.protocol.TProtocol import TProtocolException\r\nfrom thrift.TRecursive import fix_spec\r\nfrom enum import IntEnum\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom .ttypes import *\r\ntypeConversion = {\r\n        TestEnum.TestEnum0:     SharedEnum.SharedEnum0,\r\n        TestEnum.TestEnum1:     SharedEnum.SharedEnum1,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now it outputs this - \r\n```python\r\nfrom thrift.Thrift import TType, TMessageType, TFrozenDict, TException, TApplicationException\r\nfrom thrift.protocol.TProtocol import TProtocolException\r\nfrom thrift.TRecursive import fix_spec\r\nfrom enum import IntEnum\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom .ttypes import *\r\ntypeConversion = {\r\n        TestEnum.TestEnum0:     shared_types.ttypes.SharedEnum.SharedEnum0, # Change\r\n        TestEnum.TestEnum1:     shared_types.ttypes.SharedEnum.SharedEnum1, # Change\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nThis fixes the overflow in `TMemoryBuffer::ensureCanWrite()` when the current usage plus the length of new content exceeds the max of uint32_t (e.g. 4GB). The buggy code is\r\n```cpp\r\n  const uint32_t current_used = bufferSize_ - avail;\r\n  const uint32_t required_buffer_size = len + current_used;\r\n  if (required_buffer_size > maxBufferSize_) {\r\n    throw TTransportException(...)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n`len + current_used` could overflow in `uint32_t`, which results in not rejecting the write, i.e. not throwing TTransportException. The follow-up write on this TMemoryBuffer will write to invalid memory address and leads to a crash (e.g. [IMPALA-12223](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-12223))\r\n\r\nWe should define `current_used` as `uint64_t` so the result of the expression is also `uint64_t`. Changed the type of `required_buffer_size` to `uint64_t` as well.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for this.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

recent change modified SecurityTest.cpp/SecurityFromBufferTest.cpp to handle OpenSSL3 by using OPENSSL_VERSION_MAJOR to detect the different OpenSSL versions. OPENSSL_VERSION_MAJOR is not available on OpenSSL 1.x, so these tests no longer compile on Ubuntu 20, etc.\r\n\r\nThe underlying reason for the OpenSSL3 change is that older versions of TLS (1.0, 1.1) are only accessible when specifying @SECLEVEL=0. Some distributions with OpenSSL 1.1.1 (Ubuntu 20) make them accessible at @SECLEVEL=1, so the tests can also fail in that circumstance.\r\n\r\nThis removes the reference to OPENSSL_VERSION_MAJOR and changes the test to specify @SECLEVEL=0 for OpenSSL versions that have @SECLEVEL support (> 1.1.0).\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n - Tested SecurityTest/SecurityFromBufferTest on Ubuntu 20 and 22\r\n - Tested with OpenSSL 1.0.2\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n This fixes the build/functionality for SecurityTest/SecurityFromBufferTest after the changes in https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/05604e261455f1d85a5d04c4364a21d2a7e417b2\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nCurrently, the `to_string()` overloads in `TToString.h` call the `std::locale` constructor for every single call. Creating locales is surprisingly expensive. We have an application where we - especially during tests - write large amounts of Thrift dumps to disk, and is this application we currently spend around 17% of total CPU time in std::locale's constructor (building with MSVC, in a Release build - other compilers might optimize this away?). With this change, it's basically down to zero.\r\n\r\nSince we always create the exact same locale anyways, using a `const static` one does not hurt.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

THRIFT-5710\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n There is an issue with the header transport implementation in `nodejs`. All TBufferedTransport and TFramedTransport instances across all connections and clients share a single object for their read and write headers. There is a different copy for the two transport types, but within one type, they are shared.\r\n\r\nThis means that there are both data races and incorrect results possible: \r\n* You can write headers to a request that has written headers but hasn't flushed yet. This is especially troubling if the headers are used for auth, because you're able to mix up requests and auth as the wrong entity.\r\n* You can read headers from other requests. They only clobber each other if they have the same name, but the union of all seen headers is returned in `getReadHeaders `.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that we aren't calling the header transport constructor with the new `this` from the concrete implementations, so the `TBufferedTransport.prototype = new THeaderTransport();` line is not properly binding `this` and causes the object sharing.\r\n\r\nYou can see this in the two test cases that fail before this PR and succeed now. Two **completely unrelated** `TFramedTransport` objects shared read and write results.\r\n\r\nI did not create a JIRA ticket yet because I am still waiting on approval, but I wanted to get the PR up ASAP; we are currently experiencing this bug in production.\r\n\r\nNote: my editor reformatted those two or three random lines because they had trailing whitespace and/or tabs, which is against the coding style. I can revert them if you want this PR to be clean, but figured I'd leave the changes in since the existing files were incorrectly formatted.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [X] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?
