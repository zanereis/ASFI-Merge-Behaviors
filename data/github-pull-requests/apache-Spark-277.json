It should allow converting arrays of primitive types and arrays of arrays. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect to_json(array('1','2','3'))\r\n> [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]\r\nselect to_json(array(array(1,2,3),array(4)))\r\n> [[1,2,3],[4]]\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a couple sql tests for arrays of primitive type and of arrays. Also I added round trip test `from_json` -> `to_json`.","created_at":"2018-08-24T19:29:04Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:22Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T04:40:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccf598d9ac9cfb344c94afa3379b47ae788f958d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90c968772d74c8aadc7a4d0e74e226554b921486","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:to_json-array","ref":"to_json-array","sha":"90c968772d74c8aadc7a4d0e74e226554b921486","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

a large Spark job with speculation turned on was causing executor heartbeats to time out on the driver end after sometime and eventually, after hitting the max number of executor failures, the job would fail. \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe main reason for the heartbeat timeouts was that the heartbeat-receiver-event-loop-thread was blocked waiting on the TaskSchedulerImpl object which was being held by one of the dispatcher-event-loop threads executing the method dequeueSpeculativeTasks() in TaskSetManager.scala. On further analysis of the heartbeat receiver method executorHeartbeatReceived() in TaskSchedulerImpl class, we found out that instead of waiting to acquire the lock on the TaskSchedulerImpl object, we can remove that lock and make the operations to the global variables inside the code block to be atomic. The block of code in that method only uses  one global HashMap taskIdToTaskSetManager. Making that map a ConcurrentHashMap, we are ensuring atomicity of operations and speeding up the heartbeat receiver thread operation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nScreenshots of the thread dump have been attached below:\r\n**heartbeat-receiver-event-loop-thread:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1409\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-24 at 9 19 57 am\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL only have two options for managing thriftserver memory - enable spark.sql.thriftServer.incrementalCollect or not\r\n\r\n### The case of enabling spark.sql.thriftServer.incrementalCollects\r\n   - Pros\r\n        - thriftserver can handle large output without OOM.\r\n   - Cons\r\n        - Performance degradation because of executing task partition by partition.\r\n        - Handle queries with count-limit inefficiently because of executing all partitions.\r\n        - Does not cache result for FETCH_FIRST\r\n\r\n### The case of disabling spark.sql.thriftServer.incrementalCollects\r\n   - Pros\r\n        - Good performance for small output\r\n   - Cons\r\n        - Memory peak usage is too large because allocating decompressed & deserialized rows in \"batch\" manner, and OOM could occur for large output.\r\n        - It is difficult to measure memory peak usage of Query, so configuring spark.driver.maxResultSize is very difficult.\r\n        - If decompressed & deserialized rows fills up eden area of JVM Heap, they moves to old Gen and could increase possibility of \"Full GC\" that stops the world.\r\n \r\n### The improvement idea of solving these problems is below.\r\n   - DataSet does not decompress & deserialize result, and just return total row count & iterator to SQL-Executor. By doing that, only compressed data reside in memory, so that the memory usage is not only much lower than before but can be controlled with spark.driver.maxResultSize config.\r\n\r\n   - After SQL-Executor get total row count & iterator from DataSet, SQL-Executor could decide whether deserializing them collectively or iteratively with considering returned row count.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently when running Spark on Kubernetes a logger is run by the client that watches the K8S API for events related to the Driver pod and logs them.  However for the container status aspect of the logging this simply dumps the raw object which is not human readable e.g.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-24 at 10 37

pretty print this information but only invokes these at the end of a job.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the logging to always use the pretty printing methods, additionally modifying them to include further useful information provided by the K8S API.\r\n\r\nA similar issue also exists when tasks are lost that will be addressed by further commits to this PR\r\n\r\n- [x] Improved `LoggingPodStatusWatcher`\r\n- [x] Improved container status on task failure\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuilt and launched jobs with the updated Spark client and observed the new human readable output:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-24 at 11 09 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2104864/44579429-5353de00-a78e-11e8-9228-c750af8e6311.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-24 at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n    Back port of #20393 and #22079.\r\n\r\n    Currently shuffle repartition uses RoundRobinPartitioning, the generated result is nondeterministic since the sequence of input rows are not determined.\r\n\r\n    The bug can be triggered when there is a repartition call following a shuffle (which would lead to non-deterministic row ordering), as the pattern shows below:\r\n    upstream stage -> repartition stage -> result stage\r\n    (-> indicate a shuffle)\r\n    When one of the executors process goes down, some tasks on the repartition stage will be retried and generate inconsistent ordering, and some tasks of the result stage will be retried generating different data.\r\n\r\n    The following code returns 931532, instead of 1000000:\r\n    ```\r\n    import scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n    val res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n      x\r\n    }.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n      if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n        throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n      }\r\n      x\r\n    }\r\n    res.distinct().count()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    In this PR, we propose a most straight-forward way to fix this problem by performing a local sort before partitioning, after we make the input row ordering deterministic, the function from rows to partitions is fully deterministic too.\r\n\r\n    The downside of the approach is that with extra local sort inserted, the performance of repartition() will go down, so we add a new config named `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` to control whether this patch is applied. The patch is default enabled to be safe-by-default, but user may choose to manually turn it off to avoid performance regression.\r\n\r\n    This patch also changes the output rows ordering of repartition(), that leads to a bunch of test cases failure because they are comparing the results directly.\r\n\r\n    Add unit test in ExchangeSuite.\r\n\r\n    With this patch(and `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` set to true), the following query returns 1000000:\r\n    ```\r\n    import scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\n    spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition\", \"true\")\r\n\r\n    val res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n      x\r\n    }.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n      if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n        throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n      }\r\n      x\r\n    }\r\n    res.distinct().count()\r\n\r\n    res7: Long = 1000000\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Author: Xingbo Jiang

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current error message is  often confusing to a new Spark user that a column containing \".\" needs backticks quote. \r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following code:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(0, 1).toDF('a.b')['a.b']\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe current message looks like this and is confusing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot resolve column name \"a.b\" among (a.b)\r\n```\r\nThis PR improves the error message to, \r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot resolve column name \"a.b\" among (a.b). Try adding backticks to the column name, i.e., `a.b`;\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe v2 API always adds a projection when converting to physical plan to ensure that rows are all `UnsafeRow`. This is added after any filters run by Spark, assuming that the filter and projection can handle InternalRow, but this fails if those nodes contain python UDFs. This PR detects the Python UDFs and adds a projection above the filter to immediately convert to `UnsafeRow` before passing data to python.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis adds a test for the case reported in SPARK-25213 in python's SQL tests.","created_at":"2018-08-23T17:41:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T21:22:25Z","closed_at":"2018-08-27T21:22:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eba152feb01c0002cede7e05d7a35634fdd5f880","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/550368eaeebdc87f2c89bad7214f2624784eeb04","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-25213-v2-add-project-before-python-filter","ref":"SPARK-25213-v2-add-project-before-python-filter","sha":"550368eaeebdc87f2c89bad7214f2624784eeb04","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current `DAGScheduler.handleTaskCompletion` code, when a shuffleMapStage with job not in runningStages and its `pendingPartitions` is empty, the job of this shuffleMapStage will never complete.\r\n\r\n*Think about below*\r\n\r\n1. Stage 0 runs and generates shuffle output data.\r\n\r\n2. Stage 1 reads the output from stage 0 and generates more shuffle data. It has two tasks with the same partition: ShuffleMapTask0 and ShuffleMapTask0.1(speculation).\r\n\r\n3. ShuffleMapTask0 fails to fetch blocks and sends a FetchFailed to the driver. The driver resubmits stage 0 and stage 1. The driver will place stage 0 in runningStages and place stage 1 in waitingStages.\r\n\r\n4. ShuffleMapTask0.1 successfully finishes and sends Success back to driver. The driver will add the mapstatus to the set of output locations of stage 1. because of stage 1 not in runningStages, the job will not complete.\r\n\r\n5. stage 0 completes and the driver will run stage 1. But, because the output sets of stage 1 is complete, the drive will not submit any tasks and make stage 1 complte right now. Because the job complete relay on the `CompletionEvent` and there will never a `CompletionEvent` come, the job will hang.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT","created_at":"2018-08-23T13:43:16Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T00:06:22Z","closed_at":"2020-01-09T00:06:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19d51d667d4f7a1ec2f28ba80d3123b6d1efc98b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDataset.apply calls dataset.deserializer (to provide an early error) which ends up calling the full Analyzer on the deserializer. This can take tens of milliseconds, depending on how big the plan is.\r\nSince Dataset.apply is called for many Dataset operations such as Dataset.where it can be a significant overhead for short queries.\r\nAccording to a comment in the PR that introduced this check, we can at least remove this check for DataFrames: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20402#discussion_r164338267\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, filter pushdown will not work if Parquet schema and Hive metastore schema are in different letter cases even spark.sql.caseSensitive is false.\r\n\r\nLike the below case:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration.setInt(\"parquet.block.size\", 8 * 1024 * 1024)\r\nspark.range(1, 40 * 1024 * 1024, 1, 1).sortWithinPartitions(\"id\").write.parquet(\"/tmp/t\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t (ID LONG) USING parquet LOCATION '/tmp/t'\")\r\nsql(\"select * from t where id < 100L\").write.csv(\"/tmp/id\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough filter \"ID < 100L\" is generated by Spark, it fails to pushdown into parquet actually, Spark still does the full table scan when reading.\r\nThis PR provides a case-insensitive field resolution to make it work.\r\n\r\nBefore - \"ID < 100L\" fail to pushedown:\r\n<img width=\"273\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-23 at 10 08 26 pm\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates the v2 write path to a similar structure as the v2 read path. Individual writes are configured and tracked using `WriteConfig` (analogous to `ScanConfig`) and this config is passed to the methods of `WriteSupport` that are specific to a single write, like `commit` and `abort`.\r\n\r\nThis new config will be used to communicate overwrite options to data sources that implement new support classes, `BatchOverwriteSupport` and `BatchPartitionOverwriteSupport`. The new config could also be used by implementations to get and hold locks to make operations atomic.\r\n\r\nStreaming is also updated to use a `StreamingWriteConfig`. Options that are specific to a write, like schema, output mode, and write options.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is primarily an API change and should pass existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-22T21:26:41Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T23:59:24Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T23:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4c7112b863122719e3b07d8e84db68c85161fa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/847300f76391c5e171e3f54b21bf6f2efc177f0e","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-25188-add-write-config","ref":"SPARK-25188-add-write-config","sha":"847300f76391c5e171e3f54b21bf6f2efc177f0e","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nVectorizedParquetRecordReader::initializeInternal rebuilds the column list and path list once for each column. Therefore, it indirectly iterates 2\\*colCount\\*colCount times for each parquet file.\r\n\r\nThis inefficiency impacts jobs that read parquet-backed tables with many columns and many files. Jobs that read tables with few columns or few files are not impacted.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes initializeInternal so that it builds each list only once.\r\n\r\nI ran benchmarks on my laptop with 1 worker thread, running this query:\r\n<pre>\r\nsql(\"select * from parquet_backed_table where id1 = 1\").collect\r\n</pre>\r\nThere are roughly one matching row for every 425 rows, and the matching rows are sprinkled pretty evenly throughout the table (that is, every page for column <code>id1</code> has at least one matching row).\r\n\r\n6000 columns, 1 million rows, 67 32M files:\r\n\r\nmaster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSwitch `org.apache.hive.service.server.HiveServer2` to register its shutdown callback with Spark's `ShutdownHookManager`, rather than direct with the Java Runtime callback.\r\n\r\nThis avoids race conditions in shutdown where the filesystem is shutdown before the flush/write/rename of the event log is completed, particularly on object stores where the write and rename can be slow.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere's no explicit unit for test this, which is consistent with every other shutdown hook in the codebase.\r\n\r\n* There's an implicit test when the scalatest process is halted.\r\n* More manual/integration testing is needed.\r\n\r\nHADOOP-15679 has added the ability to explicitly execute the hadoop shutdown hook sequence which spark uses; that could be stabilized for testing if desired, after which all the spark hooks could be tested. Until then: external system tests only.","created_at":"2018-08-22T17:26:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T11:04:08Z","closed_at":"2018-08-31T06:49:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86ee935ac3dd9f6bf4ffdc25c202f731a91baa29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fbced52e5687cd5eb6a06c3b9bca5cbeb9343002","head":{"label":"steveloughran:BUG/SPARK-25183-shutdown","ref":"BUG/SPARK-25183-shutdown","sha":"fbced52e5687cd5eb6a06c3b9bca5cbeb9343002","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe race condition that caused test failure is between 2 threads.\r\n- The MicrobatchExecution thread that processes inputs to produce answers and then generates progress events.\r\n- The test thread that generates some input data, checked the answer and then verified the query generated progress event.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization structure between these threads is as follows\r\n1. MicrobatchExecution thread, in every batch, does the following in order.\r\n   a. Processes batch input to generate answer.\r\n   b. Signals `awaitProgressLockCondition` to wake up threads waiting for progress using `awaitOffset`\r\n   c. Generates progress event\r\n\r\n2. Test execution thread\r\n   a. Calls `awaitOffset` to wait for progress, which waits on `awaitProgressLockCondition`.\r\n   b. As soon as `awaitProgressLockCondition` is signaled, it would move on the in the test to check answer.\r\n  c. Finally, it would verify the last generated progress event.\r\n\r\nWhat can happen is the following sequence of events: 2a -> 1a -> 1b -> 2b -> 2c -> 1c.\r\nIn other words, the progress event may be generated after the test tries to verify it.\r\n\r\nThe solution has two steps.\r\n1. Signal the waiting thread after the progress event has been generated, that is, after `finishTrigger()`.\r\n2. Increase the timeout of `awaitProgressLockCondition.await(100 ms)` to a large value.\r\n\r\nThis latter is to ensure that test thread for keeps waiting on `awaitProgressLockCondition`until the MicroBatchExecution thread explicitly signals it. With the existing small timeout of 100ms the following sequence can occur.\r\n - MicroBatchExecution thread updates committed offsets\r\n - Test thread waiting on `awaitProgressLockCondition` accidentally times out after 100 ms, finds that the committed offsets have been updated, therefore returns from `awaitOffset` and moves on to the progress event tests.\r\n - MicroBatchExecution thread then generates progress event and signals. But the test thread has already attempted to verify the event and failed.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the timeout to large (e.g., `streamingTimeoutMs = 60 seconds`, similar to `awaitInitialization`), this above type of race condition is also avoided.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan locally many

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ExternalAppendOnlyMapSuiteCheck` test is flaky. \r\n\r\nWe use a `SparkListener` to collect spill metrics of completed stages. `withListener` runs the code that does spill. Spill status was checked after the code finishes but it was still in `withListener`. At that time it was possibly not all events to the listener bus are processed.\r\n\r\nWe should check spill status after all events are processed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocally ran unit tests.","created_at":"2018-08-22T02:45:44Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:38Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T21:21:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2e52c99b0d9d34c93a9fd582991fd291d96d74d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/77e108a18788502d05b1b3dacc21c3e72eac4264","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-25163","ref":"SPARK-25163","sha":"77e108a18788502d05b1b3dacc21c3e72eac4264","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using older versions of spark releases,  a use case generated a huge code-gen file which hit the limitation `Constant pool has grown past JVM limit of 0xFFFF`.  In this situation, it should fail immediately. But the diagnosis message sent to RM is too large,  the ApplicationMaster suspended and RM's ZKStateStore was crashed. For 2.3 or later spark releases the limitation of code-gen has been removed, but maybe there are still some uncaught exceptions that contain oversized error message will cause such a problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR is aim to cut down the diagnosis message size.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLimit Thread Pool size in BlockManager Master and Slave endpoints.\r\n\r\nCurrently, BlockManagerMasterEndpoint and BlockManagerSlaveEndpoint both have thread pools with nearly unbounded (Integer.MAX_VALUE) numbers of threads. In certain cases, this can lead to driver OOM errors. This change limits the thread pools to 100 threads; this should not break any existing behavior because any tasks beyond that number will get queued.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe value returned by a call to `spark.conf.get(key)` may be specified in one of 3 different ways:\r\n1. By explicitly setting the value of `key` via e.g. `spark.conf.set(key, value)`\r\n1. By the client providing a default value at call-time via e.g. `spark.conf.get(key, clientDefault)`\r\n1. By the ConfigBuilder providing a default value when it is declared via e.g. `SQLConf.buildConf(key).createWithDefault(builderDefault)`\r\n\r\nCurrently, the order of precedence among these different sources of value is:\r\n1. Explicit value if one was set\r\n1. Otherwise, client default if one was provided\r\n1. Otherwise, builder default\r\n\r\nThere is currently one exception to this rule: if the builder happened to be declared with a default that is another ConfigBuilder (via e.g. `SQLConf.buildConf(key).fallbackConf(parentConfigBuilder)`), then we check the builder default first (in this case the parent conf and potentially the parent's parent and so on) and then only use the client default if none of the fallback confs had explicit values defined.\r\n\r\nFrom a user perspective, this means that the client default may or may not be used depending on whether the config in question was declared with a scalar default or a fallback conf default, which is usually not obvious. In the case of a fallback conf default, the value returned by `spark.conf.get` may depend on an arbitrary number of parent confs, which seems like it will lead to particularly difficult to diagnose errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes that exception and adds a test to guarantee that the precedence order listed above is applied to all conf types. Note that this is an explicit change from the previous implementation in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19974\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test to verify the precedence order for confs with both scalar and fallback conf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nRight now, the default server side netty handler threads is 2 * # cores, and can be further configured with parameter spark.shuffle.io.serverThreads.\r\nIn order to process a client request, it would require one available server netty handler thread.\r\nHowever, when the server netty handler threads start to process ChunkFetchRequests, they will be blocked on disk I/O, mostly due to disk contentions from the random read operations initiated by all the ChunkFetchRequests received from clients.\r\nAs a result, when the shuffle server is serving many concurrent ChunkFetchRequests, the server side netty handler threads could all be blocked on reading shuffle files, thus leaving no handler thread available to process other types of requests which should all be very quick to process.\r\n\r\nThis issue could potentially be fixed by limiting the number of netty handler threads that could get blocked when processing ChunkFetchRequest. We have a patch to do this by using a separate EventLoopGroup with a dedicated ChannelHandler to process ChunkFetchRequest. This enables shuffle server to reserve netty handler threads for non-ChunkFetchRequest, thus enabling consistent processing time for these requests which are fast to process. After deploying the patch in our infrastructure, we no longer see timeout issues with either executor registration with local shuffle server or shuffle client establishing connection with remote shuffle server.\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\nFor Original PR please refer here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21402\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and stress testing.\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T17:36:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T13:32:34Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T14:10:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2045d724b27bee5010e255ed97ea3b65d4230cd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0348ec8d5570aab9d744043a3d6a88950f4aeb5c","head":{"label":"redsanket:SPARK-24335","ref":"SPARK-24335","sha":"0348ec8d5570aab9d744043a3d6a88950f4aeb5c","user":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39640326,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY0MDMyNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"redsanket/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf scale of decimal type is > 6 , 0 value will be shown in scientific notation and hence, when the dataframe output is saved to external database, it fails due to scientific notation on \"0\" values.\r\nIn java.math.BigDecimal,  if the scale is >6 , 0 will be show in scientific notation.\r\n\r\n Eg: In Spark\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"create table test (a decimal(10,7), b decimal(10,6), c decimal(10,8))\")\r\nspark.sql(\"insert into test values(0, 0,0)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"insert into test values(1, 1, 1)\")\r\nspark.table(\"test\").show()\r\n+---------+--------+----------+\r\n|        a|       b|         c|\r\n+---------+--------+----------+\r\n|     0E-7|0.000000|      0E-8| //If scale > 6, zero is displayed in scientific notation\r\n|1.0000000|1.000000|1.00000000|\r\n+---------+--------+----------+\r\n```\r\nIn Postgresql, 0 decimal value will be shown with non-scientific notation (plain string).\r\nEg: In Postgress\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE Testdec (a DECIMAL(10,7), b DECIMAL(10,6), c DECIMAL(10,8));\r\nINSERT INTO Testdec VALUES (0,0,0);\r\nINSERT INTO Testdec VALUES (1,1,1);\r\nselect * from Testdec;\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n        a  |        b  |     c\r\n-----------+-----------+----------\r\n 0.0000000 |  0.000000 | 0.00000000\r\n 1.0000000 |  1.000000 | 1.00000000\r\n```\r\nThis PR makes spark SQL result consistent with Postgresql.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded 2 unit tests \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T15:19:19Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T07:58:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-18T05:59:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b411d0a3165f2260acfcade991a58c458af2bf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b4c2f24c500bb972b5ffd14897bfb5fb2184ffc","head":{"label":"vinodkc:br_fix_precision_zero","ref":"br_fix_precision_zero","sha":"6b4c2f24c500bb972b5ffd14897bfb5fb2184ffc","user":{"login":"vinodkc","id":9795818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86780265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Njc4MDI2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"vinodkc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vinodkc","id":9795818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc/spark","description":"Mirror

What issue does this pull request address ?\r\nJIRA: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24985)\r\nIn the case of Full Outer Joins of large tables, in the presence of data skew around the join keys for either of the joined tables, OOMs exceptions occur. While its possible to increase the heap size to workaround, Spark should be resilient to such issues as skews can happen arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#16909 introduced `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` & changed `SortMergeJoinExec` to use `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` for every join, except 'Full Outer Join'. This PR makes changes to make 'Full Outer Joins' to use `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n#### Unit testing\r\n- Changed a test-case in `JoinSuite`.\r\n- Existing tests in `OuterJoinSuite` were used to verify correctness.\r\n\r\n#### Stress testing\r\n- This is still a work in progress. I plan to verify this patch using a production workload.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T08:48:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-18T14:55:57Z","closed_at":"2019-05-18T14:55:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13db8d9e25dcb426250a071170725e1e7ea1caca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b4353035fc09d4f8a6f159b060153371ad3dd1ed","head":{"label":"sujithjay:SPARK-24985","ref":"SPARK-24985","sha":"b4353035fc09d4f8a6f159b060153371ad3dd1ed","user":{"login":"sujithjay","id":17567499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay","html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93888385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mzg4ODM4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sujithjay/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sujithjay","id":17567499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay","html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay/spark","description":"Fork

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nYARN `AmIpFilter` adds a new parameter \"RM_HA_URLS\" to support RM HA, but Spark on YARN doesn't provide a such parameter, so it will be failed to redirect when running on RM HA. The detailed exception can be checked from JIRA. So here fixing this issue by adding \"RM_HA_URLS\" parameter.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA few SQL tests for R were failing in my development environment. In this PR, i am attempting to\r\naddress some of them.  Below are the reasons for the failure.\r\n\r\n- The catalog api tests assumes catalog artifacts named \"foo\" to be non existent. I think name such as foo and bar are common and i use it frequently. I have changed it to a string that i hope is less likely to collide.\r\n- One test assumes that we only have one database in the system. I had more than one and it caused the test to fail. I have changed that check.\r\n- One more test which compares two timestamp values fail - i am debugging this now. I will send it as a followup - may be.\r\n   \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nIts a test fix.","created_at":"2018-08-20T20:40:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T03:14:28Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T03:00:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a26c807b7fa197f470a5633446ea972da48dee5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00310629370b401adaae3996b19a1d5c85642be2","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:r-sql-test-fix1","ref":"r-sql-test-fix1","sha":"00310629370b401adaae3996b19a1d5c85642be2","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix several bugs in failure handling of barrier execution mode:\r\n* Mark TaskSet for a barrier stage as zombie when a task attempt fails;\r\n* Multiple barrier task failures from a single barrier stage should not trigger multiple stage retries;\r\n* Barrier task failure from a previous failed stage attempt should not trigger stage retry;\r\n* Fail the job when a task from a barrier ResultStage failed;\r\n* RDD.isBarrier() should not rely on `ShuffleDependency`s.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded corresponding test cases in `DAGSchedulerSuite` and `TaskSchedulerImplSuite`.","created_at":"2018-08-20T17:27:33Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T15:29:07Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T15:29:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7e7c2125a230021d06c12c479c720cef8b9c6f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32ea946c68c5f3108fb18f7e936ba440f7537144","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:failure","ref":"failure","sha":"32ea946c68c5f3108fb18f7e936ba440f7537144","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-25126] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25126)\r\nreports loading a large number of orc files consumes a lot of memory\r\nin both 2.0 and 2.3. The issue is caused by creating a Reader for every\r\norc file in order to infer the schema. \r\n\r\nIn OrFileOperator.ReadSchema, a Reader is created for every file\r\nalthough only the first valid one is used. This uses significant\r\namount of memory when there `paths` have a lot of files. In 2.3\r\na different code path (OrcUtils.readSchema) is used for inferring\r\nschema for orc files. This commit changes both functions to create\r\nReader lazily.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with a newly added test case by @dongjoon-hyun

triggers one Spark job per RDD partition. This is very bad for RDDs with a lot of small partitions.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, this PR introduces a way to access SQLConf in the scheduler event loop thread, so that we don't need to use

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR for supporting logical timestamp types https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21935, a SQL configuration spark.sql.avro.outputTimestampType is added, so that user can specify the output timestamp precision they want.\r\n\r\nWith PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21847,  the output file can be written with user specified types. \r\n\r\nSo there is no need to have such trivial configuration. Otherwise to make it consistent we need to add configuration for all the Catalyst types that can be converted into different Avro types. \r\n\r\nThis PR also add a test case for user specified output schema with different timestamp types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRun Spark-Sql job use transform features(`ScriptTransformationExec`) with config `spark.speculation = true`, sometimes job fails and we found many Executor Dead through `Executor Tab`, through analysis log and code we found :\r\n\r\n`ScriptTransformationExec` start a new thread(`ScriptTransformationWriterThread`), the new thread is very likely to throw `TaskKilledException`(from iter.map.foreach part) when speculation is on, this exception will captured by `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` which registered during Executor start, `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` will call `System.exit (SparkExitCode.UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION)` to shutdown `Executor`, this is unexpected.\r\n\r\nWe should not kill the executor just because `ScriptTransformationWriterThread` fails. log the error(not only `TaskKilledException`) instead of throwing it is enough, Exception already pass to `ScriptTransformationExec` and handle by `TaskRunner`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRegister `TestUncaughtExceptionHandler` to test case in `ScriptTransformationSuite`, then assert there is no Uncaught Exception

user of sketches library(https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive) reported an issue with HLL Sketch Hive UDAF that seems to be a bug in Spark or Hive. Their code runs fine in 2.1 but has an issue from 2.2 onwards. For more details on the issue, you can refer to the discussion in the sketches-user list:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/sketches-user/GmH4-OlHP9g/MW-J7Hg4BwAJ\r\n\r\n \r\nOn further debugging, we figured out that from 2.2 onwards, Spark hive UDAF provides support for partial aggregation, and has removed the functionality that supported complete mode aggregation(Refer https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19060 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18186). Thus, instead of expecting update method to be called, merge method is called here (https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hive/hll/SketchEvaluator.java#L56) which throws the exception as described in the forums above.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded two new configs, **spark.sql.execution.supportPartialAggregationHiveUDAF** and **spark.sql.execution.supportPartialAggregationWindowFunctionUDAF** that is true by default but can be set to false when using UDAF's which do not support partial aggregation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the above issue have been stated in the google group link posted above but will repeat them here for convenience:\r\n**1.

This is important for data lineage projects like Spline. Related issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24647\r\n\r\nTo be able to track data lineage for Structured Streaming (I intend to implement this to Open Source Project Spline), the monitoring needs to be able to not only to track where the data was read from but also where results were written to. This could be to my knowledge best implemented using monitoring StreamingQueryProgress. However currently written data offsets are not available on Sink or StreamWriter interface. Implementing as proposed would also bring symmetry to StreamingQueryProgress fields sources and sink.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL returns NULL for a column whose Hive metastore schema and Parquet schema are in different letter cases, regardless of spark.sql.caseSensitive set to true or false. This applies not only to Parquet, but also to ORC. Following is a brief summary:\r\n* ParquetFileFormat doesn't support case-insensitive field resolution.\r\n* native OrcFileFormat supports case-insensitive field resolution, however it cannot handle duplicate fields.\r\n* hive OrcFileFormat doesn't support case-insensitive field resolution.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15799 reverted case-insensitive resolution for ParquetFileFormat and hive OrcFileFormat. This PR brings it back and improves it to do case-insensitive resolution only if Spark is in case-insensitive mode. And field resolution will fail if there is ambiguity, i.e. more than one field is matched. ParquetFileFormat, native OrcFileFormat and hive OrcFileFormat are all supported.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests added.","created_at":"2018-08-19T16:30:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T09:44:39Z","closed_at":"2018-08-20T03:22:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdf8b098e1eba1c8e43727fde795fd491471fe42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c3d20b654609c86de9c24c9751ec34916f3aabd","head":{"label":"seancxmao:SPARK-25132","ref":"SPARK-25132","sha":"5c3d20b654609c86de9c24c9751ec34916f3aabd","user":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121346712,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEzNDY3MTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"seancxmao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch does pooling for both kafka consumers as well as fetched data. The overall benefits of the patch are following:\r\n\r\n* Both pools support eviction on idle objects, which will help closing invalid idle objects which topic or partition are no longer be assigned to any tasks.\r\n* It also enables applying different policies on pool, which helps optimization of pooling for each pool.\r\n* We concerned about multiple tasks pointing same topic partition as well as same group id, and existing code can't handle this hence excess seek and fetch could happen. This patch properly handles the case.\r\n* It also makes the code always safe to leverage cache, hence no need to maintain reuseCache parameter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, pooling kafka consumers is implemented based on Apache Commons Pool, which also gives couple of benefits:\r\n\r\n* We can get rid of synchronization of KafkaDataConsumer object while acquiring and returning InternalKafkaConsumer.\r\n* We can extract the feature of object pool to outside of the class, so that the behaviors of the pool can be tested easily.\r\n* We can get various statistics for the object pool, and also be able to enable JMX for the pool.\r\n\r\nFetchedData instances are pooled by custom implementation of pool instead of leveraging Apache Commons Pool, because they have CacheKey as first key and \"desired offset\" as second key which \"desired offset\" is changing - I haven't found any general pool implementations supporting this.\r\n\r\nThis patch brings additional dependency, Apache Commons Pool 2.6.0 into `spark-sql-kafka-0-10` module.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests as well as new tests for object pool.\r\n\r\nAlso did some experiment regarding proving concurrent access of consumers for same topic partition.\r\n\r\n* Made change on both sides (master and patch) to log when creating Kafka consumer or fetching records from Kafka is happening.\r\n* branches\r\n  * master: https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/tree/SPARK-25151-master-ref-debugging\r\n  * patch: https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/tree/SPARK-25151-debugging\r\n* Test query (doing self-join)\r\n  * https://gist.github.com/HeartSaVioR/d831974c3f25c02846f4b15b8d232cc2\r\n* Ran query from spark-shell, with using `local[*]` to maximize the chance to have concurrent access\r\n* Collected the count of fetch requests on Kafka via command: `grep \"creating new Kafka consumer\" logfile | wc -l`\r\n* Collected the count of creating Kafka consumers via command: `grep \"fetching data from Kafka consumer\" logfile | wc -l`\r\n\r\nTopic and data distribution is follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:0:99440\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:1:99489\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:2:397759\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:3:198917\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:4:99484\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:5:497320\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:6:99430\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:7:397887\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:8:397813\r\ntruck_speed_events_stream_spark_25151_v1:9:0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe experiment only used smallest 4 partitions (0, 1, 4, 6) from these partitions to finish the query earlier.\r\n\r\nThe result of experiment is below:\r\n\r\nbranch | create Kafka consumer | fetch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, for better UX, Apache Spark provides data source backward compatibility by using the predefined built-in `backwardCompatibilityMap`.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L564\r\n\r\nAlthough this mapping table is maintained carefully, but it's not flexible when we have multiple implementations like Avro/CSV/ORC. This introduced many additional options to decide which implementation will be used for the registered `shortName` (like `csv`, `orc`, `avro`).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to extend Spark backward-compatibility-mapping capability by allowing users provide a custom mapping in a general manner as configuration. If a user faces some issue with the provided mapping, he/she can override it by configuration. Also, this will reduce the complexity in the code, too. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with a newly added test case.","created_at":"2018-08-17T12:45:05Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T23:14:41Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T23:14:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2588674e6d69ef746029f6d842bbd00ca74bae2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e477a8ed6d2ea331be357a6fbbb3d55c504971b1","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-25143","ref":"SPARK-25143","sha":"e477a8ed6d2ea331be357a6fbbb3d55c504971b1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"162326c0ee8419083ebd1669796abd234773e9b6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSometimes Python worker can't open socket in `_load_from_socket` for some reason, but it's difficult to figure out the reason because the exception doesn't even contain the messages from `socket.error`s.\r\nWe should at least add the error messages when raising the exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually in my
