(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [X] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build

(not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build

describe my change in short.I use golang as develop language usually.I found in thrift go, it's dangerous to call in chain style due to lack of nil check in `Get` method and init variable use `var` rather than `new` method, the  former get a `nil` pointer and the latter get a `empty` pointer.  \r\nI create a code snippet to show my change solve case

rs\r\n\r\nUpdated the Rust generator and the lib,test,tutorial code to be **2018 edition only**. This is a breaking change, but makes both the generator and the rust codebase easier to reason about because we only have to support one edition.\r\n\r\nI think this is worthwhile because the Rust community has (in general) moved fast, and it's been two years since this edition has been out.\r\n\r\nAlso moved minimum Rust compiler to 1.40.0 (last release of 2019). \r\n\r\n- [X] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nXcode 11.3 (Swift 5.1) generates deprecation warnings for:\r\n* Hashable protocol conformance using new Hasher type\r\n* Use of `withUnsafeBytes`\r\n\r\n`TAsyncResult<T>` is also redundant with the advent of `Result<T, Error>` in the stdlib.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses all of the above and removes old versions of Swift from the CI job.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing properly.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-27T14:52:30Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T13:43:04Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T13:43:04Z","merged_at":"2020-04-24T13:43:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4711a617821a0610e377f048abf8dfe0c701773","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/d48a16abf9d00c2e3b712ed95e33df71444bb9d5","head":{"label":"guardian:swift-5.1","ref":"swift-5.1","sha":"d48a16abf9d00c2e3b712ed95e33df71444bb9d5","user":{"login":"guardian","id":164318,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2NDMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian","html_url":"https://github.com/guardian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72133692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MjEzMzY5Mg==","name":"french-thrift","full_name":"guardian/french-thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guardian","id":164318,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2NDMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian","html_url":"https://github.com/guardian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guardian/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guardian/french-thrift","description":"Originally, Thrift without reserved keywords - now, provides async fixes in Swift.

cpp\r\n\r\nThis is my first open-source contribution so do let me know if any changes are required and I'll be sure to make them :)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes) - **Ticket existed**\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"? - **No breaking changes**\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources. - **Code changes exist**\r\n\r\n**The problem:**\r\nA deadlock was noticed when large input to the thrift server fills the buffer that the event handler (TNonblockingServer::TConnection::workSocket) reads from and events timeout occurs.\r\n\r\n**What causes the deadlock:**\r\nThread 1 (TNonblockingServer::TConnection::workSocket) is waiting for the lock to add task (addTask()) to the task queue after which it will read the next event from buffer.\r\nThread 2 has the lock (taken in frame 12 in apache::thrift::concurrency::ThreadManager::Worker::run()) and is waiting to notify thread 1.\r\nNotify cannot happen if the buffer to be read by thread 1 is full and thread 1 is waiting for the lock taken by thread 2.\r\n\r\n**Proposed changes:**\r\nThe proposed changes remove the deadlock so the buffer can be emptied and requests can be processed as expected. In the non-timeout scenario processing and notify occurs without the lock similar to what is proposed. \r\n\r\nUsing the thrift calculator tutorial with added string param to add() to demonstrate the deadlock.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Run cpp_server\r\n2. Run cpp_client (Should take <20 sec) - This results in the server getting into deadlock.\r\n3. Run cpp_client 1 5 (With args 1 5 - indicating 1 thread and 5 requests). If cpp_server is deadlock all requests fail with \"ERROR: open() timed out\". The cpp_server will also cease to present any prints on stdout. If not either \"ERROR: THRIFT_EAGAIN (timed out)\" or \"Call successful!\" is obtained (Since we are forcefully sleeping in out server on 1 in 5 calls if any call sleeps all subsequent can time out untill sleep completes. A repeated try will guarantee at least one successful call).\r\n\r\nDeadlock can also be found by using gdb to look at the process thread stack trace.\r\n![Screenshot 2020-03-26 at 3 46 03

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nThe previous PR added multiplexing support but contained a logic error when checking the message type. It should allow `oneway` and `call` message types and reject all others, but it rejected `oneway` and `call` messages and accepted all others.\r\n\r\nI've fixed the bug and updated the unit tests.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5121\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

PR updates NodeJS on Ubuntu Xenial to 10.x. This is because NodeJS 6.x that was previously used does not support newer node modules. Also, since January 2020, NodeJS 8.x is EOL. Therefore 10.x is the currently oldest, supported NodeJS version.\r\n\r\nThe Dockerfile was tested locally so the docker build should work. Also, NodeJS is the currently successfully employed version on other thrift docker builds.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue https://travis-ci.org/apache/thrift/jobs/654070652 that is now solved in https://travis-ci.org/apache/thrift/jobs/654644828, so please review and merge. However note that the build still does not fully succeed with a later error about a required Ruby update. This second issue is very likely unrelated to this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Apache Jira ticket THRIFT-5116\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?

PR adds a minor change to the build configuration. The current Javascript library configuration does not build on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 with an error in `utf-8-validate 4.x`.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates to current latest `utf-8-validate 5.x` which resolves the build issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates `json-int64` to a new patch-level release `1.0.2`. According to the documentation, patch-level upgrades should be harmless.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates a number of build tools to their current latest version. The updated build tools are not integral part of the release. Updated build tools are:\r\n * browserify\r\n * grunt\r\n * grunt-jsdoc\r\n * jsdoc\r\n * jslint\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-02-21T16:08:11Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T09:45:07Z","closed_at":"2020-02-23T13:58:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fe2c0917e7aae1a5d2488fd7337453c792d2fdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/df1433115443cd33a10bfbdb2e5193855156489f","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_updated_javascript_dependencies","ref":"bda_updated_javascript_dependencies","sha":"df1433115443cd33a10bfbdb2e5193855156489f","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror

PR adds a minor change to the build configuration. The current cmake implementation behaves differently than the current autotools implementation. In the autotools implementation, the thrift compiler is copied to the `compiler/cpp/` directory so it can be used by other builds and tests (i.e. by the Javascript build). The cmake implementation does not have this step, so it can not perform certain additional build tasks.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the copy-step for the thrift compiler from the build directory to the `compiler/cpp/` directory. There should be no downsides to this step.\r\n\r\nI am aware that autotools may at some point be deprecated. However I am under the impression that this PR is still worthwhile because it helps to bridge the gap until this point in time. With little overhead, this PR enables additional build and test steps that previously worked only with autotools. When autotools are eventually deprecated, this copy step can be easily removed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

PR adds a minor change to the build configuration. In the current cmake implementation, the C++ library debug suffix \"d\" is enforced. This may be convenient for the typical installation, but removing the `FORCE` property gives more freedom to users that do not apply debug suffix naming (for example users with pure debug builds).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a minor detail that allows users to override the debug suffix from the cmake options with `-DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=\"\"`. It does not change the current default behavior and should not have any adversarial side effects. Care was taken to make the change as little intrusive as possible. It adds no new lines of code and is relatively self-explanatory in its behavior.\r\n\r\nThis change is also consistent with a large number of other cmake-based projects.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-02-21T14:22:30Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T09:45:26Z","closed_at":"2020-02-23T14:13:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f94e6c4bf3a6f78776d6deb16818d333231a427e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/26553a1755b172cfa5037210b2b7c53090213e00","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_allow_override_debug_suffix","ref":"bda_allow_override_debug_suffix","sha":"26553a1755b172cfa5037210b2b7c53090213e00","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror

PR adds a minor change to the build configuration. In the current cmake implementation, the Java install location is hard-coded. However compared to C++, Java does not have a well-defined install target directory structure.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a minor detail that allows users to override JAVA_INSTALL_DIR from the cmake options with `-DJAVA_INSTALL_DIR=\"xxx\"`. It does not change the current default behavior and should not have any adversarial side effects. Care was taken to make the change as little intrusive as possible. It adds only two lines of code and is relatively self-explanatory in its behavior.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-02-21T14:10:45Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T09:45:29Z","closed_at":"2020-02-23T14:13:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e8d41e47430cf0dafff519b7bff437b9337544f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/d35cdbacfb1a98eb3f03b0048078bb6455c7bd0f","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_allow_override_java_install_dir","ref":"bda_allow_override_java_install_dir","sha":"d35cdbacfb1a98eb3f03b0048078bb6455c7bd0f","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nMy main use case with the original code change was that I wanted to be able to call `resetBuffer()` on `OBSERVE` buffers and reuse the contents for test cases over and over. While the default `resetBuffer()` cannot be used for that purpose, the same result can be achieved by calling `resetBuffer(ro_mem, ro_mem_size, OBSERVE)` as well, so the workaround is fairly trivial.\r\n\r\nWhile the former implementation would be more convenient in some cases, it makes more sense to have consistent behaviour for all `resetBuffer()` implementations.\r\n\r\nAdded test cases to clarify the effect of `MemoryPolicy` on  `TMemoryBuffer` behaviour.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nThe Swift library features `TMultiplexedProtocol` but not `TMultiplexedProcessor`, which is required for use server-side.\r\n\r\nI've added `TMultiplexedProcessor`, following the same patterns as the other language libraries. <strike>I've marked the [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5084) as _Breaking-Change_ since</strike> It removes the `associatedType` from the `TProcessor` protocol. Since the existing `TProcessor` definition uses an `associatedType `, it makes it impossible for `TMultiplexedProcessor` to implement `TProcessor`. By definition it should support processors of multiple services, not a single service.\r\n\r\nI've added tests which require a change to `Package.swift` to run using `swift test`.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build

(not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build
