See the security advisory\nfor details: <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2\">https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2</a>\nThe vulnerability was discovered by <a href=\"https://github.com/erik-krogh\"><code>@​erik-krogh</code></a> from GitHub\nSecurity Lab (GHSL). Thanks for reporting!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug Fixes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revert a change from 0.4.0 that changed IN to be a comparison (issue694).\nThe primary expectation is that IN is treated as a keyword and not as a\ncomparison operator. That also follows the definition of reserved keywords\nfor the major SQL syntax definitions.</li>\n<li>Fix regular expressions for string parsing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sqlparse now uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.cfg (issue685).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/647d1457acf7d88614215841eb15d423df2a1895\"><code>647d145</code></a> Update Changelog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/58dae6fcd2a51209aeccd4fff3b923bf37714e19\"><code>58dae6f</code></a> Bump version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/d9d69f47ed13a583c81473211f44ae320470a58b\"><code>d9d69f4</code></a> Removed test file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/64bb91f4880b46f73b4cc9207ae9ccc180d56d1b\"><code>64bb91f</code></a> Testing branch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/c457abd5f097dd13fb21543381e7cfafe7d31cfb\"><code>c457abd</code></a> Remove unnecessary parts in regex for bad escaping.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/b949fdf9a1538f98b57612bef6306fc38f32aaf7\"><code>b949fdf</code></a> CI: Use codecov action.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/fc76056fb8f0ec713a3f2a2b6206a3336932c382\"><code>fc76056</code></a> Cleanup regex for detecting keywords (fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/709\">#709</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/7fdb2da82d51a9a02baaefb5c7fe5cbbaac4329e\"><code>7fdb2da</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/633\">#633</a> from shikanime/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/dd9d5b91d7aa30e4a000d5370f09dc99378891dc\"><code>dd9d5b9</code></a> Fix get_type with comments between WITH keyword</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/907fb496f90f2719095a1f01fe24db1e5c0e15a8\"><code>907fb49</code></a> change singleton behavior</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/compare/0.4.3...0.4.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sqlparse&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.3&new-version=0.4.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

KCL client isn't used by KinesisIO. However, unfortunately, some model classes of KCL leak into the API (KinesisClientRecord, InitialPositionInStream).  Additionally, KinesisIO internally uses KCL utils to generate aggregated messages and de-aggregate them.\r\n\r\nThe `glue` dependency brings in an additional http client implementation for the SDK, causing the SDK to reject the runtime configuration.\r\n\r\nThis bumps the KCL version and removes all unused transitive dependencies that cause trouble. These would only be required if running the KCL client itself.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

(RW lock)\r\n\r\nSome of these could have been caught by running the tests in race detector mode, but the latter two require a multiprocessing runner that splits, and that won't be meaningfully available until the Prism runner is default.\r\n\r\nFixes #26373.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#26369\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior was to flush all appends made to a bag state to a single state API append.  This can result in large appends that may cause memory pressure as single large element must be encoded/decoded/sent over grpc as one element instead of chunked. Additionally it results in large elements observed by the runner which is then unable to split without parsing.\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to consume the prefix of a ByteOutputStream to implement.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR publishes a build scan for every CI build on Jenkins and GitHub Actions and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.\r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache Beam project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at https://ge.apache.org/, hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Beam project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Apache Beam build is configured to publish build scans to the publicly available https://scans.gradle.com/. This pull request enhances that functionality by instead publishing build scans to https://ge.apache.org/. On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Beam will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\nVery soon, we will follow up this PR with one that connects the Apache Beam build to a remote build cache node solely for the Apache Beam project to further help speed up builds with build caching.\r\n\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the Maven builds already connected to https://ge.apache.org/, the [Spring project’s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.\r\n\r\nfixes #26350\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.0.2</h2>\n<p>wazero 1.0.2 improves compiler performance, supports non-blocking stdin and adds a couple new experimental APIs.</p>\n<p>Many people were involved in a lot of work in the last 3 weeks. Please reach out and thank them!</p>\n<h2>Improved compiler performance</h2>\n<p>wazero has a compile phase (CompileModule) which lowers WebAssembly bytecode into an intermediate representation (IR) and into machine code. This process is CPU and memory intensive and has been optimized significantly since 1.0.1.</p>\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3\">SQLite</a> wasm, to ensure the encouraging improvements were relevant to real-world use cases.</p>\n<pre><code>goos: linux\ngoarch: amd64\npkg: github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/internal/integration_test/bench\ncpu: AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 16-Core Processor\n                                       │  v1.0.1.txt   │              new.txt               │\n                                       │    sec/op     │   sec/op     vs base               │\nCompilation_sqlite3/compiler-32          1001.9m ±  2%   544.0m ± 2%  -45.70% (p=0.001 n=7)\nCompilation_sqlite3/interpreter-32       208.57m ±  5%   83.81m ± 5%  -59.82% (p=0.001 n=7)\n<pre><code>                                   │  v1.0.1.txt   │               new.txt               │\n                                   │     B/op      │     B/op      vs base               │\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compilation_sqlite3/compiler-32          305.10Mi ± 0%   55.31Mi ± 0%  -81.87% (p=0.001 n=7)\nCompilation_sqlite3/interpreter-32       142.24Mi ± 0%   51.77Mi ± 0%  -63.60% (p=0.001 n=7)</p>\n<pre><code>                                   │  v1.0.1.txt   │              new.txt               │\n                                   │   allocs/op   │  allocs/op   vs base               │\n</code></pre>\n<p>Compilation_sqlite3/compiler-32           5217.0k ± 0%   343.2k ± 0%  -93.42% (p=0.001 n=7)\nCompilation_sqlite3/interpreter-32       1770.43k ± 0%   14.00k ± 0%  -99.21% (p=0.001 n=7)\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>The changes to bring the above included a series of refactoring by <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> on <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1202\">union types</a>, as well <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2\"><code>dozens of optimizations by @​mathetake</code></a>, and a couple by <a href=\"https://github.com/ckaznocha\"><code>@​ckaznocha</code></a>.</p>\n<p>All of this was easier due to frequent and thorough advice by <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and our latest core maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a>. Thanks to all involved for the epic improvement in less than 3 weeks!</p>\n<h2>Non-blocking stdin</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm\">container2wasm</a> is an interesting project that converts containers such that they can run in a webassembly runtime, such as a browser or wazero.</p>\n<p>One feature this relies on is non-blocking access to STDIN. Like some other runtimes, wazero didn't handle this properly.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a lot of effort by <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> with advice from <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and support from the container2wasm author <a href=\"https://github.com/ktock\"><code>@​ktock</code></a>, wazero now handles non-blocking STDIN properly (via the select syscall).</p>\n<h2>Experimental changes</h2>\n<p>Code in our &quot;experimental&quot; directory isn't under an API guarantee, so can change even in a patch version. Here are a couple new experiments since last release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pelletier\"><code>@​pelletier</code></a> added a StackIterator parameter to listeners, allowing inspection of the stack leading to a function call. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Pryz\"><code>@​Pryz</code></a> for the initial design and background, as this is used for CPU profiling data.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> added <code>emscripten.InstantiateForModule</code> to dynamically build function imports given a CompiledModule. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> for the idea and testing with various PDF tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

JavaDoc to BundleManager.\r\n1. Add JavaDoc\r\n2. Rename some tests\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nThis was a repurposed PR.\r\n\r\nOriginal description: name tryStartBundle to countNewElement.\r\nThe current implementation tries to start the bundle, then adds an element to the new bundle. countNewElement is a better naming, because\r\n\r\n1. A new element is always added, but a bundle is not always started.\r\n3. The only usage of this method is in DoFnOp.processElement, it reads better to context.\r\n\r\nWe can also add a startBundle interface in the future, but there are currently no use cases.\r\n\r\nThe new name changes the subject to adding an element as a theme, and starting the bundle as a lazy side effect. It aligns more with what the method is actually doing.\r\n\r\nOne symmetry we are breaking is in DoFnOp.processElement, we had a `tryStartBundle` paired with a `tryFinishBundle`. Instead now we have `countNewElement` paired with `tryFinishBundle`. I think the old reading favors 1 element per bundle, while the new reading favors multiple elements in a bundle, and we check if the bundle is full/should be finished after each add.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n1. Update unit test names.\r\n2. Remove duplicate tests.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
