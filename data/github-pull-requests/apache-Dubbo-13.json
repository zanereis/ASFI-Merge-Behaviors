easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-18T11:53:08Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T02:19:24Z","closed_at":"2023-09-19T02:19:24Z","merged_at":"2023-09-19T02:19:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"ade91c9b696c12a1840b72e69f039f625033430a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/49d209fc6b7ac4dcd8ca5f79e384884e75864914","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0918-ut","ref":"0918-ut","sha":"49d209fc6b7ac4dcd8ca5f79e384884e75864914","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-15T08:57:17Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T01:45:29Z","closed_at":"2023-09-20T01:45:28Z","merged_at":"2023-09-20T01:45:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"edaaa1612190c60467cae14bf9550e86bd0ca004","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/939492f30673e5ba41a114a374dfc4edc4c9285d","head":{"label":"NingleXu:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"939492f30673e5ba41a114a374dfc4edc4c9285d","user":{"login":"NingleXu","id":91795546,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXiwWg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91795546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu","html_url":"https://github.com/NingleXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":691911067,"node_id":"R_kgDOKT25mw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"NingleXu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NingleXu","id":91795546,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXiwWg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91795546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu","html_url":"https://github.com/NingleXu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NingleXu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NingleXu/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-15T06:34:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T03:19:39Z","closed_at":"2023-09-25T11:35:01Z","merged_at":"2023-09-25T11:35:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"0fd51b1ca05fa91156ed7817b68cb800628b39a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b2d0448ef3bc7df30d4de697d55d16602c295b78","head":{"label":"liuzg-coder:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"b2d0448ef3bc7df30d4de697d55d16602c295b78","user":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":691446148,"node_id":"R_kgDOKTahhA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liuzg-coder/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T11:17:29Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T11:34:34Z","closed_at":"2023-10-23T03:06:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47dd60832266dec6d2b1412ef41c0047058a11e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1c14940453c8817662ceb28cc82dcdd3c89fbe17","head":{"label":"FoghostCn:3.3.0-beta.1-release","ref":"3.3.0-beta.1-release","sha":"1c14940453c8817662ceb28cc82dcdd3c89fbe17","user":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":653568896,"node_id":"R_kgDOJvSrgA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"FoghostCn/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn/dubbo","description":"Apache

there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the native-image scenario, each Netty ChannelHandler requires a reflect config. This PR modifies the way of config generation to a unified approach, To prevent native-image failures due to missing configuration for newly added handlers.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-08T12:34:22Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T03:59:51Z","closed_at":"2023-09-12T03:59:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d928882b5e893f9917f3aceb34fa73d1e1fed98b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7691ae13525154a1d0d0167f0598092f5e5f948e","head":{"label":"FoghostCn:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"7691ae13525154a1d0d0167f0598092f5e5f948e","user":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":653568896,"node_id":"R_kgDOJvSrgA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"FoghostCn/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-07T11:33:01Z","updated_at":"2023-09-08T01:36:17Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T01:36:17Z","merged_at":"2023-09-08T01:36:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"843da6db6cdfdfea9112edfd0ac3cc0d3497a498","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c9e662beec04e561eaadb568916af2f2188a44e6","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0907-test","ref":"0907-test","sha":"c9e662beec04e561eaadb568916af2f2188a44e6","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-07T02:04:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T08:05:18Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T08:05:18Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T08:05:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b5c186076fd4e6d238ae0a8feb96a4406008504","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b87c547e5108a705092c510aa6759103553b9f82","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/remove_dubbo-build-tools","ref":"feat/remove_dubbo-build-tools","sha":"b87c547e5108a705092c510aa6759103553b9f82","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-04T12:19:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T03:31:55Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T03:31:54Z","merged_at":"2023-09-05T03:31:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"8009c72030ecb7086bbf33e8e1d42410353c2e4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4d8d20599997715888f1c870a5e6e8ecdb777a2a","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/ignore_spi_implementation","ref":"fix/ignore_spi_implementation","sha":"4d8d20599997715888f1c870a5e6e8ecdb777a2a","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nAs the title says, fix incorrect timeout message. The time it takes for the client to send messages may exceed the set timeout. In this case, the timeout information should prompt \"client-side timeout\" instead of \"server-side timeout\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n* Modified org.apache.dubbo.remoting.exchange.support.DefaultFuture#getTimeoutMessage\r\n* Add org.apache.dubbo.remoting.exchange.support.DefaultFutureTest#clientTimeoutSend\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-03T02:26:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-03T03:26:12Z","closed_at":"2023-09-03T02:36:26Z","merged_at":"2023-09-03T02:36:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"af566233dbb9673c9da18b545133bfaca0bd5bf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/50f288f0e46c2c029461d92a452d8b2802baaa33","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0903-ignore","ref":"0903-ignore","sha":"50f288f0e46c2c029461d92a452d8b2802baaa33","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-01T07:06:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T07:57:21Z","closed_at":"2023-09-01T07:07:40Z","merged_at":"2023-09-01T07:07:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"e436f1eee9871d0a22b7768fced722ccebc0707e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ed5e8afadfe601dca54738c653f62887e06ca0b9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0901-stop","ref":"0901-stop","sha":"ed5e8afadfe601dca54738c653f62887e06ca0b9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T14:37:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T02:26:02Z","closed_at":"2023-09-01T02:26:02Z","merged_at":"2023-09-01T02:26:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e6a32ba68eddf1f966ba7ee74990528c1e1c42c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/29ba85005b833912905796e2f23e4240ba04fecd","head":{"label":"namelessssssssssss:fix_conflict","ref":"fix_conflict","sha":"29ba85005b833912905796e2f23e4240ba04fecd","user":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616260320,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLti4A","name":"dubbo-core","full_name":"namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCrrently, ` ServiceConfig `and` ReferenceConfig` relies on the metadata API to export service metadata.\r\n This caused dubbo-config-api depends on dubbo-metadata-api explicitly. \r\n\r\n```Java    \r\n//ServiceConfig.exportUrl \r\n   for (String protocol : protocols) {\r\n                    if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(protocol)) {\r\n                        URL localUrl = URLBuilder.from(url).\r\n                            setProtocol(protocol).\r\n                            build();\r\n                        localUrl = exportRemote(localUrl, registryURLs, registerType);\r\n                        if (!isGeneric(generic) && !getScopeModel().isInternal()) {\r\n                            MetadataUtils.publishServiceDefinition(localUrl, providerModel.getServiceModel(), getApplicationModel());\r\n                        }\r\n                        this.urls.add(localUrl);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n//ReferenceConfig.createProxy\r\n...\r\n        URL consumerUrl = new ServiceConfigURL(CONSUMER_PROTOCOL, referenceParameters.get(REGISTER_IP_KEY), 0,\r\n                referenceParameters.get(INTERFACE_KEY), referenceParameters);\r\n        consumerUrl = consumerUrl.setScopeModel(getScopeModel());\r\n        consumerUrl = consumerUrl.setServiceModel(consumerModel);\r\n        MetadataUtils.publishServiceDefinition(consumerUrl, consumerModel.getServiceModel(), getApplicationModel());\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR can make this process become optional, by providing a new SPI interface with one default implement:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n@SPI(\"default\")\r\npublic interface MetadataPublisher {\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Publish a service metadata to all available MetadataReport.\r\n     */\r\n    void publishServiceDefinition(URL url, ServiceDescriptor serviceDescriptor, ApplicationModel applicationModel);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```Java\r\n@Activate(\"default\")\r\npublic class DefaultMetadataPublisher implements MetadataPublisher {\r\n\r\n    private static final ErrorTypeAwareLogger logger = LoggerFactory.getErrorTypeAwareLogger(DefaultMetadataPublisher.class);\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void publishServiceDefinition(URL url, ServiceDescriptor serviceDescriptor, ApplicationModel applicationModel) {\r\n        if (getMetadataReports(applicationModel).isEmpty()) {\r\n            String msg = \"Remote Metadata Report Server is not provided or unavailable, will stop registering service definition to remote center!\";\r\n            logger.warn(REGISTRY_FAILED_LOAD_METADATA, \"\", \"\", msg);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            String side = url.getSide();\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew Usage:\r\n```Java    \r\n//ServiceConfig\r\nprivate void publishServiceDefinition(URL url){\r\n        MetadataPublisher metadataPublisher = getApplicationModel().getBeanFactory().getBean(MetadataPublisher.class);\r\n        if(metadataPublisher != null){\r\n            metadataPublisher.publishServiceDefinition(url, providerModel.getServiceModel(), getApplicationModel());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate void exportUrl(URL url, List<URL> registryURLs, RegisterTypeEnum registerType) {\r\n...\r\n                url = exportRemote(url, registryURLs, registerType);\r\n                if (!isGeneric(generic) && !getScopeModel().isInternal()) {\r\n                    publishServiceDefinition(url);\r\n                }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n* Add SPI MetadataPublisher\r\n* Add MetadataPublisher impl DefaltMetadataPublisher\r\n* Move SPI file def of MetadataServiceURLParamsMetadataCustomizer and ExporterDeployListener back to dubbo-registry-api\r\n\r\nTo avoid cyclic dependencies, the  MetadataServiceURLParamsMetadataCustomizer and ExporterDeployListener will leave in dubbo-config-api, and will move to dubbo-registry-api after dubbo-config-api refactor.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T12:52:37Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T03:15:27Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T03:15:27Z","merged_at":"2023-09-11T03:15:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"9eb83d16bb867998984da58ca84436aa6e75f11b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/19b9f73a516c5c912cf9cc830246548dfd1a7b33","head":{"label":"namelessssssssssss:metadata_publisher","ref":"metadata_publisher","sha":"19b9f73a516c5c912cf9cc830246548dfd1a7b33","user":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616260320,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLti4A","name":"dubbo-core","full_name":"namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namelessssssssssss","id":100946116,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgRQxA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100946116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss","html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namelessssssssssss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namelessssssssssss/dubbo-core","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T02:55:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T09:12:53Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T09:12:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75ad064b3a162ffd2b95e105cf3a3cde5dcf51f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e8cf8850e0a6156c03875479ed560ee44f34f066","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/upgrade_dubbo_build_tools","ref":"feat/upgrade_dubbo_build_tools","sha":"e8cf8850e0a6156c03875479ed560ee44f34f066","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-30T06:29:02Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T03:22:21Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T03:22:21Z","merged_at":"2023-09-05T03:22:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"35746aaf5a3e6eab9181fedb37fd8cc00793469c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/377804095d129db7dafb7d6463232b7059d59323","head":{"label":"aofall:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"377804095d129db7dafb7d6463232b7059d59323","user":{"login":"aofall","id":10182210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgyMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10182210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall","html_url":"https://github.com/aofall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aofall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"168b6578077f232c91d1ddec965a505eff84770a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-29T15:35:35Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T02:50:36Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T02:50:36Z","merged_at":"2023-09-05T02:50:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdd7a405641c994a55d85690b87291867bee6820","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bd3b83d9fce23fd95360443735d4f631e33390e2","head":{"label":"Nortyr:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"bd3b83d9fce23fd95360443735d4f631e33390e2","user":{"login":"Nortyr","id":42056534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr","html_url":"https://github.com/Nortyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nortyr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"c12a57eb3c5593b735ea342c99b5981188d5720d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-27T08:08:12Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T15:16:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-27T15:16:57Z","merged_at":"2023-08-27T15:16:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"79ba4cd6b737fa9a2af92a6d9a2189454dc5b623","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e811bf6cdc02730db61df9fc43558755a3c79342","head":{"label":"yanfangli85:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"e811bf6cdc02730db61df9fc43558755a3c79342","user":{"login":"yanfangli85","id":63247242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQ3MjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63247242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85","html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":679207171,"node_id":"R_kgDOKHvhAw","name":"dubbo3.2","full_name":"yanfangli85/dubbo3.2","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanfangli85","id":63247242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjQ3MjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63247242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85","html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanfangli85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanfangli85/dubbo3.2","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T07:28:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T08:27:37Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T07:39:52Z","merged_at":"2023-08-23T07:39:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5cc40c56a9f522ea2ef053b467026566806a07d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12951/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12951/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12951/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9dc8da675eedc6e357f31e86b2d5d0983cadec89","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0823-key","ref":"0823-key","sha":"9dc8da675eedc6e357f31e86b2d5d0983cadec89","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T03:39:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T15:32:31Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T15:32:30Z","merged_at":"2023-10-11T15:32:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"c10d95b56a48e88d9014238a56e7ee1ea18a33d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9f9bb37f4010fb29aef0d95745b4b6939adab67f","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-executor-refactor","ref":"3.2-executor-refactor","sha":"9f9bb37f4010fb29aef0d95745b4b6939adab67f","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T03:24:17Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T04:23:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T03:27:10Z","merged_at":"2023-08-23T03:27:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0de4c395e895f4f6034e433553dafc767e5a31b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f022941bbb0fa823ca8538482cf00f12a8ab62ff","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0823-reconnect","ref":"0823-reconnect","sha":"f022941bbb0fa823ca8538482cf00f12a8ab62ff","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n**As a part of dubbo-core refactor, we need to reduce DefaultConfigValidator's dependency on other modules.**\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSome config validation operation depends on certain module APIs\r\n```Java\r\n//ConfigValidatorUtils\r\n public static void validateAbstractInterfaceConfig(AbstractInterfaceConfig config) {\r\n        checkName(LOCAL_KEY, config.getLocal());\r\n        checkName(\"stub\", config.getStub());\r\n        checkMultiName(\"owner\", config.getOwner());\r\n        checkExtension(config.getScopeModel(), ProxyFactory.class, PROXY_KEY, config.getProxy());\r\n        checkExtension(config.getScopeModel(), Cluster.class, CLUSTER_KEY, config.getCluster());\r\n        checkMultiExtension(config.getScopeModel(), Arrays.asList(Filter.class, ClusterFilter.class), FILTER_KEY, config.getFilter());\r\n        checkNameHasSymbol(LAYER_KEY, config.getLayer());\r\n\r\n        List<MethodConfig> methods = config.getMethods();\r\n        if (CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(methods)) {\r\n            methods.forEach(ConfigValidationUtils::validateMethodConfig);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\nAfter refactor:\r\n```Java\r\n@Activate\r\npublic class InterfaceConfigValidator implements ConfigValidator<AbstractInterfaceConfig> {\r\n\r\n    public static void validateAbstractInterfaceConfig(AbstractInterfaceConfig config) {\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkName(LOCAL_KEY, config.getLocal());\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkName(\"stub\", config.getStub());\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkMultiName(\"owner\", config.getOwner());\r\n\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkExtension(config.getScopeModel(), ProxyFactory.class, PROXY_KEY, config.getProxy());\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkExtension(config.getScopeModel(), Cluster.class, CLUSTER_KEY, config.getCluster());\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkMultiExtension(config.getScopeModel(), Arrays.asList(Filter.class, ClusterFilter.class), FILTER_KEY, config.getFilter());\r\n        ConfigValidationUtils.checkNameHasSymbol(LAYER_KEY, config.getLayer());\r\n\r\n        List<MethodConfig> methods = config.getMethods();\r\n        if (CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(methods)) {\r\n            methods.forEach(MethodConfig::validate);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void validate(AbstractInterfaceConfig config) {\r\n        validateAbstractInterfaceConfig(config);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean isSupport(Class<?> configClass) {\r\n        return AbstractInterfaceConfig.class.isAssignableFrom(configClass);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThen, we can put this ConfigValidator to any module we want.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n* Turn interface ConfigValidator to SPI \r\n* Split DefaultConfigValidator to ConfigValidator implements.\r\n\r\nThis allows the configuration validation logic aggregated in DefaultConfigValidator to be distributed back into the ConfigValidator implements, reducing DefaultConfigValidator's dependency on other

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-21T09:50:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T02:19:11Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T02:19:11Z","merged_at":"2023-08-23T02:19:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2352df095c86b50496eea7d31d569fe02f8ebac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ac0ca205de08d2e70fb77e17c10b6512bef4c256","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0821-injvm","ref":"0821-injvm","sha":"ac0ca205de08d2e70fb77e17c10b6512bef4c256","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache
