Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing instantiation of Hms Uri with HiveSync tool.\r\nUpdates how we handle HMS URIs so that we are able to handle multiple targets in the same multi-deltastreamer. We're currently setting the URIs in the hadoop configuration once and assuming that all HMS targets are the same. This change updates these assumptions so that we can handle a case where the user provides multiple targets by creating a copy of the configuration when there is a value already present in the hadoop configuration.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes bug customer is experiencing when there are multiple HMS instances\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `AlterTableCommand`, `DropHoodieTableCommand`, `Spark30AlterTableCommand`, `Spark31AlterTableCommand` would not only update the specified table, but also would update the

But `AlterHoodieTableAddColumnsCommand`, `AlterHoodieTableChangeColumnCommand` missed to update schema of table with  ro/rt suffix. \r\nThis pr aims to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing config naming for OOB schema evol support to handle missing cols and data type demotion. Config is named as \"hoodie.write.handle.missing.cols.and.datatype.demotion\". Intention of this config is as follows:\r\n```\r\nWhen a non-nullable column is missing from incoming batch during a write operation, the write operation will fail schema compatibility check. Set this option to true will make the missing column be filled with null values to successfully complete the write operation. Similarly, when a column's data type is demoted (from long to int), enabling this config will succeed the batch of writes keeping the final table schema in long. If not for this config, the write may fail since long to int is not backwards compatible evolution.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves usability.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

the current implementation of run multi tables services, the clustering task and compaction task both build metaclient repeatedly for each table, causing additional overhead. To reduce this overhead, we extract the construction of metaclient and only construct it once for each table, passing it as a parameter to the corresponding task.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, when running multi tables services, the write config lacks some information from the table config, such as the table name. This leads to empty strings when retrieving the table name in certain situations. For example, when configuring the prefix for metrics, if not specified, the table name is used as the prefix. However, in the current situation, without the table config, it's impossible to differentiate the metrics of different tables, resulting in an empty prefix. By adding the table config to the write config beforehand, we can obtain all the configuration information in the subsequent write config step.\r\nTaking a metrics example, it would be displayed as follows before the fix:\r\n`\".replacecommit.totalFilesInsert\":\"2\"`\r\nAfter the fix, it would be displayed as follows:\r\n`\"test_tb.replacecommit.totalFilesInsert\":\"2\"`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we made a small modification by removing the redundant construction of metaclient in the clusteringJob's constructor.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe now construct metaclient only once per table and add table config to the write config to obtain all necessary information. Furthermore, unnecessary construction of metaclient in the clusteringJob's constructor has been removed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the partial update logic in Spark SQL MERGE INTO statement so that the partial updates are not enabled if all fields corresponding to the table schema are updated (e.g., `UPDATE SET *`), since if all fields are updated, there is no point marking the updates as partial and existing merging logic based on full updates can still be applied.  A new test is added to validate the improvement from this PR.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the case where all fields are updated and there is no need to go through partial update logic.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of reading only log files in the file group reader-based Spark parquet file format (`HoodieFileGroupReaderBasedParquetFileFormat`).\r\n- In `HoodieFileGroupReaderBasedParquetFileFormat#buildReaderWithPartitionValues`, the record iterator from the new file group reader is returned when there are only log files in a file group.\r\n- Fixes the log file iterator to properly project the data based on the required / reader schema in `SparkFileFormatInternalRowReaderContext`.\r\n- Adds new tests on read log files only in `TestHoodieFileGroupReaderBase`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs above, improves functionality.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor MOR table, when position based merging is specified, no filters should be pushed down; otherwise, the filters can be pushed down for key based one.\r\n\r\nTESTS:\r\n1. need to make the demo work to demonstrate that the filter has been pushed down.\r\n2. need to prove the the pushdown is logically correct for key based merging.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAfter fixing, the user

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic of merging partial updates with projected reader schema, i.e., the reader schema contains a subset of fields from the table schema based on the query.\r\n- When processing log records in `HoodieBaseFileGroupRecordBuffer#doProcessNextDataRecord`, the schema of the combined record is also updated in the metadata since the schema can change due to partial merging;\r\n- A bug of getting the field values from the older record in `SparkRecordMergingUtils#mergePartialRecords` is fixed.\r\n- The partial update tests in `TestPartialUpdateForMergeInto` are enhanced to cover partial merging logic.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes sure the partial merging logic is correct.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T06:07:07Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T14:20:01Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T14:20:01Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T14:20:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"3be964096ac625bafa4bc0b7625f3d05a0dd2994","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/10011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/1e96f587385fb7969f2f24946dcec50f9533dee8","head":{"label":"yihua:HUDI-7046-fix-partial-merging","ref":"HUDI-7046-fix-partial-merging","sha":"1e96f587385fb7969f2f24946dcec50f9533dee8","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196439401,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mzk0MDE=","name":"hudi","full_name":"yihua/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yihua/hudi","description":"Upserts

addition to real-time monitoring metrics, Hudi also has some result metrics, such as IO for clustering reads and writes. These metrics are meaningful for continuously observing the table service status.\r\nHowever, the existing metrics reporter either outputs to the console or memory without persistence, or it outputs to another metrics server, requiring complex environment setup. If it is only for reading the result metrics, such cumbersome operations are unnecessary. We hope to provide a simple persistent reporter where users can specify that the metrics be stored in the file system in JSON format.\r\nIdeally, we planned to update the latest version of metrics to the file system by calling shutdown through a shutdown hook when finishing. However, at that point, the Hudi file system has already closed the connection pool, making it impossible to write to the file. Therefore, we update the file by actively calling the shutdown function when finishing. Currently, in HoodieSparkSqlWriter.cleanup(), the shutdown function is actively called, which means metrics are reported at the end of the write process. By doing the same in the table service, we can achieve the same effect.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nProvides a file system-based metrics reporter\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSome parameters related to the reporter:\r\nFor example, in hoodie.metrics.reporter.type, FILESYSTEM has been added.\r\nAnd FILESYSTEM specifies the address, naming, and whether to enable scheduled writing of the metrics file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLOW\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nMetrics report type supports FILESYSTEM\r\nUpdated parameters:\r\nhoodie.metrics.reporter.type, FILESYSTEM has been added.\r\n\r\nNew parameters:\r\nhoodie.metrics.filesystem.reporter.path - The path for persisting Hudi storage metrics files.\r\nhoodie.metrics.filesystem.metric.prefix - The prefix for Hudi storage metrics persistence file names.\r\nhoodie.metrics.filesystem.overwrite.file - Whether to override the same metrics file for the same table.\r\nhoodie.metrics.filesystem.schedule.enable - Whether to enable scheduled output of metrics to the file system. Default is off, only need to output the final result to the file system.\r\nhoodie.metrics.filesystem.report.period.seconds - File system reporting period in seconds. Default to 60.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T03:33:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-13T09:46:26Z","closed_at":"2023-11-13T09:46:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bac3001c5f46420f42c7a33261d1a60fd270c869","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/10010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/aa9fd9357a2398f3d35e9e3bb71cd9bee4be8432","head":{"label":"majian1998:ts-reporter","ref":"ts-reporter","sha":"aa9fd9357a2398f3d35e9e3bb71cd9bee4be8432","user":{"login":"majian1998","id":47964462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTY0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47964462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998","html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":668640931,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ9qmow","name":"hudi","full_name":"majian1998/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"majian1998","id":47964462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTY0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47964462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998","html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen position based merging is enabled, we can safely skip reading records in delete blocks since we can use the record positions to skip records in base file, which should accelerate the performance of the delete operations.\r\n\r\nThings have been considered.\r\n1. position based merging is turned on.\r\n2. processing time based merging strategy, which is by default.\r\n3. the merging orders.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

[HUDI-6960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6960) is merged PR #9889, the `shouldExtractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` will correctly ignore partition columns in `requiredSchema`.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using the configs below, there will be read errors.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nhoodie.datasource.read.extract.partition.values.from.path = true \r\nhoodie.schema.on.read.enable

However, Hudi files (file schema) might still contain partition columns. And when partition filters are being rebuilt with these file schema against query schema, it will lead to partition columns not being found.\r\n \r\n```log\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: cannot found filter col name：region from querySchema: table {\r\n 5: id: optional int\r\n 6: name: optional string\r\n 7: ts: optional long\r\n}\r\nat org.apache.hudi.internal.schema.utils.InternalSchemaUtils.reBuildFilterName(InternalSchemaUtils.java:180)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\nFixes schema evolution read error when partition values are extracted from path.\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change.
