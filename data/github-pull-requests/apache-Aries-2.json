was trying out the SPI Fly static weaving method but I ran into an issue: the processed bundle would declare a dependency on the `org.apache.aries.spifly` package with version specification `[1.1.0,1.2.0)` (meaning `1.1.x` is allowed).\r\n\r\nThe static weaving tool I was using was at version 1.3.7 (the latest available) and I assumed the static weaving bundle should be at the same version. Since this is newer than 1.1.x, the dependency is never satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures the `Export-Package` version of the static weaving bundle is read from the same `packageinfo` file that the tool uses for the `Import-Package` instruction of the weaved bundle.","created_at":"2024-05-30T22:28:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T09:03:21Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16d59c9bdb6651cca8c1d66489efe4ea42efb026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/issues/294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aries/statuses/e1fc885327a3a3b610bd85c2eb775b93c96d73f8","head":{"label":"sabberworm:bugfix/static-weaving-version-mismatch","ref":"bugfix/static-weaving-version-mismatch","sha":"e1fc885327a3a3b610bd85c2eb775b93c96d73f8","user":{"login":"sabberworm","id":47652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm","html_url":"https://github.com/sabberworm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808350156,"node_id":"R_kgDOMC5xzA","name":"aries","full_name":"sabberworm/aries","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sabberworm","id":47652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm","html_url":"https://github.com/sabberworm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sabberworm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sabberworm/aries","description":"Apache
