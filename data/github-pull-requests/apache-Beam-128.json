in this PR:\r\n- Add a transform translator for `GroupIntoBatches` in Java to populate the URN and payload in the runner API.\r\n- Updated `GroupIntoBatches` implementation to wrap batching parameters in a class so that can be reused by both variation of the transform (with or without sharded keys).\r\n- Updated `DataflowPipelineTranslatorTest`accordingly to also check the runner api

PR upgrades the non-vendored Guava version to the latest 30.1-jre, while keeping the version 25.1-jre for certain modules (Hadoop and Cassandra-related) that require the old version of Guava.\r\n\r\n# Why do I want the latest Guava?\r\n\r\nWhen Beam publishes a recommended version of Guava for Dataflow users (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13737, WIP), I want the recommended version in line with the one in [the GCP Libraries BOM](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/wiki/The-Google-Cloud-Platform-Libraries-BOM) (with \"-jre\" suffix). This is because Google Cloud client libraries are built and tested with the newer version of Guava. I want Beam's Dataflow and Google Cloud Platform modules to be built, tested, and used with the same version of Guava as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIf we don't do this PR, we would end up a situation where the GCP Libraries BOM recommends to use Guava **30** and Beam's GCP BOM recommends Guava **25**.\r\n\r\n## What is the problem with Guava 25?\r\n\r\nWhen a library touch classes or methods that only exist in the newer version of Guava, it fails with NoClassDefFoundError or NoSuchMethodError. For example, gcsio uses `Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(java.time.Duration)` in it and Linkage Checker detects the usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(com.google.guava:guava:25.1-jre) com.google.common.util.concurrent.Uninterruptibles's method sleepUninterruptibly(java.time.Duration) is not found;\r\n  referenced by 3 class files\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.cooplock.CoopLockOperationDao (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.cooplock.CoopLockRecordsDao (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.testing.InMemoryObjectEntry (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method only exists in Guava 28 or higher. This might not be a problem for Dataflow-only users for now, but this may cause other use cases of the library. Therefore, I want to recommend the newer version of Guava to GCP users.\r\n\r\n# Problem with newer Guava version in Hadoop/Cassandra\r\n\r\nIf I naively upgrade the Guava version to 30.1-jre, the tests failed with `NoSuchMethodError` for `Futures.addCallback` and\r\n`NoSuchFieldError` for `DIGIT` (CharMatcher). Details are in [BEAM-11626](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11626).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by keeping the Guava version lower for the Hadoop/Cassandra-related modules.\r\n\r\n# Where is the Guava dependency declared?\r\n\r\nThe following Gradle modules declare dependency to the guava variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuztomo-macbookpro44% find . -name 'build.gradle' |xargs grep 'library.java.guava'\r\n./sdks/java/core/build.gradle:  shadowTest library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/kinesis/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/io/kinesis/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/amazon-web-services2/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/io/contextualtextio/build.gradle:    testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/extensions/sql/zetasql/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/maven-archetypes/examples/build.gradle:    'guava.version': dependencies.create(project.library.java.guava).getVersion(),\r\n./runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than tests, the 3 modules declaring the Guava dependencies are `sdks/java/io/kinesis`,  `sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform`, and `sdks/java/extensions/sql/zetasql`.\r\n\r\n- `sdks/java/io/kinesis` module has\r\n  - `com.amazonaws:amazon-kinesis-client:1.13.0` built with Guava 26.0-jre\r\n  - `com.amazonaws:amazon-kinesis-producer:0.14.1` built with Guava 24.1.1-jre\r\n  - Linkage Checker found no new linkage errors for beam-sdks-java-io-kinesis ([link](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/e5fa71d8a0800dbbbc9cd2626d50730e)).\r\n- Google Cloud libraries are built with the latest Guava\r\n- The [zetasql client 2020.10.1](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.zetasql/zetasql-client/2020.10.1/jar) is built with Guava 29. \r\n  - [Linkage Checker](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/beb9033d39da1545d117750c0602ae69) detected a potential conflict between `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common:2.10.1` (Yarn's WebApp class) and Guava 30. The conflict already exists in Guava 29. Therefore, existing Dataflow Zetasql users will not see a problem with Guava 30.\r\n\r\nThe `sdks/java/maven-archetypes/examples` module is tricky one. I want Hadoop/Cassandra users to use Guava 25.1 and others to use Guava 30.\r\n\r\n# What's the impact to Beam's Cassandra / Hadoop users?\r\n\r\nThere's no impact to the Beam Cassandra and Hadoop artifacts. The Maven artifact [`org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-format:2.27.0`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-format/2.27.0/jar), [`org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-cassandra:2.27.0`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-cassandra/2.27.0/jar), or [org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-file-system:2.27.0](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-file-system/2.27.0/jar)\r\n does not declare Guava dependency.\r\n\r\n## Instruction for Hadoop / Cassandra Beam users\r\n\r\nIf Beam Cassandra / Hadoop users use Beam with beam-sdks-java-io-kinesis, beam-sdks-java-io-google-cloud-platform, or beam-sdks-java-extensions-sql-zetasql, then the users need to pin Guava version to 25.1-jre. They can use `<dependencyManagement>` for Maven and `force` for Gradle.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Linkage Check\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/suztomo/beb9033d39da1545d117750c0602ae69\r\n\r\nNo new linkage errors for the default list.  There is one error in Yarn's WebApp class (see above), which is a provided dependency of hadoop-client.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

greatly simplifies the script. It also spares us from having to hard-code yet another list of supported Flink versions, which I'm trying to avoid. There is the minor downside that listing images requires them to be present locally from build_release_candidate.sh, so we can't clean them up in between builds. However, I don't think that was ever really necessary except to save disk space.\r\n\r\nR: @emilymye \r\ncc: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a workaround toward solving https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11633. In this PR, there are 2 kinds of exceptions which are not going to lead to bundle failures:\r\n* Exceptions in `@GetSize` call\r\n* Exceptions while calling finalization callback.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is not perfect since overall we want to make sure existing `BoundedSource` and `UnboundedSource` work well with SDF wrapper.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

update the Go SDK version on release. \r\nThis doesn't mean the SDK isn't out of experimental yet, but is on the way.\r\n\r\nThe Go SDK is \"automatically\" released as part of the release-branch tagging process. Go automatically takes tags from repos for handling versioning. This allows the SDK to \"know itself\" and for submitting jobs to runners (like dataflow) to properly display version information.\r\n\r\nSince I have a larger cleanup to the Release docs in the works, the [release guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/release-guide/#4-create-a-release-branch-in-apachebeam-repository) isn't being updated at this time.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

headers are not supported, there are no reflection calls remaining as this knowledge is computed once in the ConsumerSpEL singleton.\r\nWhen headers are supported but the decoder does not implement the method to examine headers, there are no reflection calls based upon a cache keyed by decoder in the ConsumerSpeEL singleton.\r\nWhen headers are supported and possibly used by the coder, a reflection-based expression is still evaluated for each deserialization.  I tried to enable expression compilation but was unable to get it working, I believe due to the generics as part of the Deserializer<T> object but I am not sure.  That is a possible performance improvement for the future for uses that require headers.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Lite users may not want to use Pub/Sub Lite as a DLQ location, as it is a pay-for-capacity system, and having the extra capacity around is not required. That being said, not allowing users to do so seems too restrictive.\r\n\r\nThe GenericDlq mechanism allows for registration of handlers for dead-letter events. These events are expected to be rare and (usually) triaged by a human, since if code could handle it directly, it would have. Usually they imply misconfiguration of some kind.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR does a few things, but is the last non \"carefully migrate\" or cleanup step for Schema support in the Go SDK.\r\n\r\n1. Theres' a toggle to enable Schema support, the package var `beam.EnableSchemas`. This will have your pipelines use the schema infrastructure to encode types that don't have an alternate custom coder registered. It's currently off, to permit graceful migration, though once remaining details are sorted out, it will switch to being default on instead.\r\n2. Adds a way to conveniently RegisterSchemaProviders which is a helper on the beam package. There's a bit of cleanup to be done around the usability experience around schemas, however, this one is probably going to stick, as it demonstrates the mechanism and includes an example of registering custom providers for given types. This allows generally unencodable types to have a substitute schema equivalent type or storgage type provided, along with appropriate encoders and decoders. Still TODO is updating the Schema testutil to handle this more directly for better total testing of implementations.\r\n3. Properly adds type handling for Uint fields (they are stored as varints, but use logical types to return to their appropriate bit interpretation).\r\n4. A benchmark is now included comparing JSON with the default and custom registered schema encoders.  Generally, schema coding is 3x faster in most cases. `go test -benchmem -run=^$ -bench='^(BenchmarkRowCoder_RoundTrip)$' github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/graph/coder` \r\n5. There are now several examples in using helper methods from the graph/coder package to write your own custom coders. Still todo is a proper guide in their use and when to use which.\r\n6. The helper meta types (beam.EncodedType, beam.EncodedFunc, beam.EncodedCoder) now support use with schemas.\r\n7. The top accumulator type accum has been swapped away from a custom JSON encoder, to a custom coder based on the schema Row encoding.\r\n\r\nMost of the above has been vetted against implementing a provider for protocol buffer types, which will be contributed to the SDK once complete.  As mentioned, there's additional cleanup around the user side of it to make it fully usable, but this set of changes has become wide ranging enough that I need to checkpoint it into the repo before I go any further. However, it should be enough for further experimentation purposes and commentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this in favor of #13804\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades the non-vendored Guava version to the latest 30.1-jre, while keeping the version 25.1-jre for certain modules (Hadoop and Cassandra-related) that require the old version of Guava.\r\n\r\n# Why do I want the latest Guava?\r\n\r\nWhen Beam publishes a recommended version of Guava for Dataflow users (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13737, WIP), I want the recommended version in line with the one in [the GCP Libraries BOM](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/wiki/The-Google-Cloud-Platform-Libraries-BOM) (with \"-jre\" suffix). This is because Google Cloud client libraries are built and tested with the newer version of Guava. I want Beam's Dataflow and Google Cloud Platform modules to be built, tested, and used with the same version of Guava as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIf we don't do this PR, we would end up a situation where the GCP Libraries BOM recommends to use Guava **30** and Beam's GCP BOM recommends Guava **25**.\r\n\r\n## What is the problem with Guava 25?\r\n\r\nWhen a library touch classes or methods that only exist in the newer version of Guava, it fails with NoClassDefFoundError or NoSuchMethodError. For example, gcsio uses `Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(java.time.Duration)` in it and Linkage Checker detects the usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(com.google.guava:guava:25.1-jre) com.google.common.util.concurrent.Uninterruptibles's method sleepUninterruptibly(java.time.Duration) is not found;\r\n  referenced by 3 class files\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.cooplock.CoopLockOperationDao (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.cooplock.CoopLockRecordsDao (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n    com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio.testing.InMemoryObjectEntry (com.google.cloud.bigdataoss:gcsio:2.1.6)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method only exists in Guava 28 or higher. This might not be a problem for Dataflow-only users for now, but this may cause other use cases of the library. Therefore, I want to recommend the newer version of Guava to GCP users.\r\n\r\n# Problem with newer Guava version in Hadoop/Cassandra\r\n\r\nIf I naively upgrade the Guava version to 30.1-jre, the tests failed with `NoSuchMethodError` for `Futures.addCallback` and\r\n`NoSuchFieldError` for `DIGIT` (CharMatcher). Details are in [BEAM-11626](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-11626).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by keeping the Guava version lower for the Hadoop/Cassandra-related modules.\r\n\r\n# Where is the Guava dependency declared?\r\n\r\nThe following Gradle modules declare dependency to the guava variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuztomo-macbookpro44% find . -name 'build.gradle' |xargs grep 'library.java.guava'\r\n./sdks/java/core/build.gradle:  shadowTest library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/kinesis/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/io/kinesis/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/amazon-web-services2/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/io/contextualtextio/build.gradle:    testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n./sdks/java/extensions/sql/zetasql/build.gradle:  compile library.java.guava\r\n./sdks/java/maven-archetypes/examples/build.gradle:    'guava.version': dependencies.create(project.library.java.guava).getVersion(),\r\n./runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/build.gradle:  testCompile library.java.guava_testlib\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than tests, the 3 modules declaring the Guava dependencies are `sdks/java/io/kinesis`,  `sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform`, and `sdks/java/extensions/sql/zetasql`.\r\n\r\n- `sdks/java/io/kinesis` module has\r\n  - `com.amazonaws:amazon-kinesis-client:1.13.0` built with Guava 26.0-jre\r\n  - `com.amazonaws:amazon-kinesis-producer:0.14.1` built with Guava 24.1.1-jre\r\n  - Linkage Checker found no new linkage errors for beam-sdks-java-io-kinesis ([link](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/e5fa71d8a0800dbbbc9cd2626d50730e)).\r\n- Google Cloud libraries are built with the latest Guava\r\n- The [zetasql client 2020.10.1](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.zetasql/zetasql-client/2020.10.1/jar) is built with Guava 29. \r\n  - [Linkage Checker](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/e5fa71d8a0800dbbbc9cd2626d50730e) detected a potential conflict between `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common:2.10.1` and Guava 30. The conflict already exists in Guava 29. Therefore, there is no problem declaring dependency with Guava 30.\r\n\r\nThe `sdks/java/maven-archetypes/examples` module is tricky one. I want Hadoop/Cassandra users to use Guava 25.1 and others to use Guava 30.\r\n\r\n# What's the impact to Beam's Cassandra / Hadoop users?\r\n\r\nThere's no impact to the Beam Cassandra and Hadoop artifacts. The Maven artifact [`org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-format:2.27.0`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-format/2.27.0/jar), [`org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-cassandra:2.27.0`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-cassandra/2.27.0/jar), or [org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-file-system:2.27.0](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.beam/beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-file-system/2.27.0/jar)\r\n does not declare Guava dependency.\r\n\r\n## Instruction for Hadoop / Cassandra Beam users\r\n\r\nIf Beam Cassandra / Hadoop users use Beam with beam-sdks-java-io-kinesis, beam-sdks-java-io-google-cloud-platform, or beam-sdks-java-extensions-sql-zetasql, then the users need to pin Guava version to 25.1-jre. They can use `<dependencyManagement>` for Maven and `force` for Gradle.\r\n\r\n# Linkage Checker\r\n\r\nThe `sdks/java/build-tools/beam-linkage-check.sh` found a new conflict in a dependency of `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client:2.10.1 (provided)` in beam-sdks-java-extensions-sql-zetasql module.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(com.google.guava:guava:30.1-jre) com.google.common.base.CharMatcher's field WHITESPACE is not found;\r\n  referenced by 1 class file\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.yarn.webapp.WebApp (org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common:2.10.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/suztomo/e5fa71d8a0800dbbbc9cd2626d50730e\r\n\r\nIf the zeta sql module happens to be used with YARN web app, then \"Instruction for Hadoop / Cassandra Beam users\" applies here to resolve the incompatibility.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Propagates pipeline options to the python DirectRunner when running in multi_processing mode.\r\n\r\nWhen running a test pipeline with the DirectRunner, and with the direct_running_mode=multi_processing I found that pipeline options were not set as expected in the worker processes, causing the pipeline to fail. Specifically I required filesystem related options to be set in order to access a remote filesystem. It seems that the sdk_worker_main.py runner script expects the options to be populated into an environment variable (PIPELINE_OPTIONS) prior to running, which was not the case for the SubprocessSdkWorker.\r\n\r\nIt also seems that the sdk_worker_main.py needs to set the loaded pipeline options using the global `filesystems.FileSystems.set_options` which wasn't the case before. This seems more surprising to me, because I would've thought that this would have blocked other filesystems running through the various portable runners which go through this script. I don't have a great understanding of all of the different paths through which to configure the workers though, so perhaps this can also occur through different paths (such as the grpc control channels?). It would be great to get some guidance if my understanding is incorrect.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
