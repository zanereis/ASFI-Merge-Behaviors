Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1831\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR handles the scenario where concurrent jobs can run on Gobblin cluster from GaaS and handles the cancellation logic properly.\r\n\r\nWhen executing jobs from GaaS to Gobblin cluster, there can be a mismatch of flowexecution ids to jobs running on Gobblin cluster. The old behavior was that the current job will be deleted regardless of the execution ID, but this could mean that a state mismatch could lead to current jobs being deleted when they should still continue to run.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we tried adding the FlowExecutionId to the jobSpec, but that meant that jobs could run concurrently on Gobblin cluster when they should have been deduped.\r\n\r\nSo instead, during cancellation, we want to check if the incoming spec has a flow execution ID. If so, then it will cancel the existing job only if the flow execution IDs match. Otherwise, it will know that the current job does not match the incoming request and should not be deleted.\r\n\r\nThis PR also uses flow execution ID if applicable as the planningjob ID and job_actualJob ID, as there should only be one of these per flow.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1830\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, we rely on the flushing event to indicate when a container transition occurs. However, if the ingestion process fails to successfully flush the data, we won't know which container is responsible. This becomes problematic when the pipeline restarts, as we won't be able to identify the root cause without manually reviewing the logs of thousands of containers. To avoid this issue, we need to develop a more reliable way of tracking container transitions that doesn't rely solely on the flushing event.\r\n\r\nThe change for this PR is to emit the event when the extractor is firstly initialized\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test, and print out the event information:\r\n2023-05-08 18:03:11 PDT INFO  [TaskStateModelFactory-task_thread-0] org.apache.gobblin.metrics.MetricContext  -

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1823\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n**Problem**: When Yarn allocates \"ghost containers\" without calling the onContainerAllocated() method and when the container is eventually released, onContainersCompleted() is called, container numbers mismatches can occur. \r\nIn the onContainerAllocated() method, we add the container to the containerMap using the container ID as the key, and increase the count for the specific tag.\r\nIn the onContainersCompleted() method, we remove the container from the containerMap and decrease the count. However, in some cases, we find that the containerMap does not contain the ID, and we ignore this while still decreasing the number of the allocated tag. We do this because sometimes onContainersCompleted() is called before onContainerAllocated() for the same container.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n1. Add the removedContainerID map to track the containers that have been released before onContainerAllocated() is called\r\n2. Go through the container map to check the whether the assigned helix instance is alive and release it when it's in-alive for more than 10 minutes\r\n3. Add TIME_OUT and COMPLETED as the un-retryable partition state and log it out to improve debugability.   \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test for exiting function, it's hard to add a unit test for a bad yarn container and helix disconnection situation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

track of work discovery time\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1829\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIn Gobblin framework, there are 2 events that look similar but do very different functions:\r\n1. WorkUnitPreparationTimer - which serializes workunits and compacts them into MultiWorkUnits\r\n2. WorkUnitCreationTimer - which tracks the time taken to discover the work needed for Gobblin to launch a job.\r\n\r\nWe want to track the latter in GaaS\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1828\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen HDFS slowness happens, we can get stuck in creating writer phase and never proceed further. So we want to add a timeout guarantee there to make sure to fail earlier and retry in this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdd new unit test and run job to make sure timeout can cause the task to retry\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

then it should order the types with its default type first instead of null\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1827\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nConsider the following description:\r\n```\r\n * Record R1 {\r\n *   fields : {[\r\n *      {\r\n *        Union : [\r\n *          null,\r\n *          Record R2 {\r\n *            fields : {[\r\n *                {\r\n *                  String S1\r\n *.                  default: String S3\r\n *                }, {\r\n *                  String S2\r\n *                }\r\n *            ]}\r\n *          }\r\n *      }\r\n *   ]}\r\n * }\r\n * will be flattened to:\r\n * Record R1 {\r\n *   fields : {[\r\n *      {\r\n *        Union : [ null, String S1]\r\n *.       default: String S3\r\n *      }, {\r\n *        Union : [ null, String S2]\r\n *      }\r\n *   ]}\r\n * }\r\n ```\r\nDue to the addition of the AvroCompatibilityHelper, Avro flattening can run into an issue in the above scenario due to the nested non-null default S3 since the default type needs to be the first type in the field order. So R1 should have field S1 as Union [String S1, null]\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

fix bug in Hive registration where classes can escape type casts\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1826\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAfter the Guava 20 upgrade, there is a bug in the Hive registration code.\r\nWhen setting table properties, `HiveTable` calls this function in `HiveRegistrationUnit` to set Properties\r\n```\r\n  protected static <T> Optional<T> populateField(State state, String key, TypeToken<T> token) {\r\n```\r\nSince it returns a type generic Optional, it is possible to assign an incorrect class to a field. So an Optional<Long> can actually be holding a String value and causes a Class cast exception.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening is that in Guava 20, `isAssignableFrom` is deprecated from the `TypeToken` class. Instead, the following code pattern was used:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      } else if (new TypeToken<Long>() {}.getRawType().isAssignableFrom(token.getClass())) {\r\n```\r\nHowever, in this case getRawType() would have returned java.Lang.Long, so it would not be assignable to the token class but rather the templated class. This would cause the code to fall through and make every property casted into an Optional<String>\r\n\r\nTo avoid all this headache, and to also properly validate the List<String> token type, we should be using `.isSupertypeOf()` in lieu of `isAssignableFrom()`.\r\n\r\nThis time also wrote a unit test to validate the runtime behavior of each type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1825\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHive retention would perform two tasks: drop the partition first and then delete the underlying files. Now, if for some reason the partition was dropped, but we couldn't delete the underlying files, the job would still succeed. Thus, if we try to re-run the job, it wouldn't fine any work and the hdfs files would never be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid running into this situation, I have made the below changes:\r\n- Delete the underlying files first and then try dropping the hive partition\r\n- throw the exceptions and fail the job rather than marking the job status as successful\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-24T18:05:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T20:46:57Z","closed_at":"2023-05-24T20:46:57Z","merged_at":"2023-05-24T20:46:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"158d6fff546ee28ad7b542bfe78e5263af8843c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/029fe8518c94f7276c8489ebada98b399d51c2d9","head":{"label":"meethngala:fail-hive-retention-when-hdfs-deletion-fails","ref":"fail-hive-retention-when-hdfs-deletion-fails","sha":"029fe8518c94f7276c8489ebada98b399d51c2d9","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1822\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, in the autoScalingManager, we iterate through all Helix tasks without logging their statuses. This means that if any issues occur and we need to restart the pipeline, we lose the Helix status information, making it difficult to investigate the problem further.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-21T23:06:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T17:05:27Z","closed_at":"2023-04-26T17:05:27Z","merged_at":"2023-04-26T17:05:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"633891080536b39f8c9c127af932d7e8b601b79e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c4daa78e3009692244b315ff521665f242bee05b","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1822","ref":"GOBBLIN-1822","sha":"c4daa78e3009692244b315ff521665f242bee05b","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1821\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nGobblin-as-a-Service assigns each flow a flow execution ID.\r\nGobblin cluster jobs generate a new ID for each job sent to it, this makes it difficult to associate them with the flow execution ID from GaaS.\r\nSince currently GaaS only sends 1 concurrent job to Gobblin cluster, we want to ensure that we can propagate these IDs for easier ID tracking, so that clients can immediately determine the flow execution ID from the GTE of a flow\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-21T17:24:26Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T17:48:11Z","closed_at":"2023-04-24T17:48:11Z","merged_at":"2023-04-24T17:48:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0c712a34f0ba573a5ecb349584d66eda068b206","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1b09770a304f030eab7773bd7d7e21f4c082cdf7","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:allow-flowId-to-propagate-job-id-gobblin-cluster","ref":"allow-flowId-to-propagate-job-id-gobblin-cluster","sha":"1b09770a304f030eab7773bd7d7e21f4c082cdf7","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1818\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nMoved the logic of creating yarn clients out of the constructors, because child class variables are not initialized until super class is created and hence it cannot use it's own initialized variables in modifying logic in overriden methods.\r\nThis is in the continuation of https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3671 work\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1817\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nchange some deprecated hive classes so that downstream projects can upgrade to higher version of hive.\r\nIn Hive 1.x which is used in Gobblin, Every kind of serde extends to `AbstractSerDe`, EXCEPT `OrcSerDe` which extends to `VectorizedSerDe`. Also all kind of serdes implements `SerDe`, so in Gobblin we type casted every type of serde to `SerDe` interface.\r\nHowever in Hive 2.x `SerDe` interface is removed and all type of serdes now extend to `AbstractSerDe` including `OrcSerDe`.\r\nSo I have made changes in this PR to handle the special case of `OrcSerDe` in such a way that if hive 2.x is on the classpath, it would not complain that `SerDe` class not found and class casting would go just fine.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-12T23:52:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T20:23:01Z","closed_at":"2023-04-14T20:23:01Z","merged_at":"2023-04-14T20:23:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebdb03fa48238a9cf5b53bc77683e80af8756697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5c96a4acb97c52e8aedfe6512d4150f97e5e9154","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:sparkAndOthers","ref":"sparkAndOthers","sha":"5c96a4acb97c52e8aedfe6512d4150f97e5e9154","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1813] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1813\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n#### Problem Statement:\r\n When Helix is under tremendous load, Helix workflows can easily exceed the 5 minute timeout. When the timeout is exceeded, our jobs clean up the Gobblin job state. Gobblin considers these workflows effectively dead. \r\n\r\nIf Helix were to schedule these workflows, the workflows will spin up and the tasks assigned will immediately have a `FileNotFoundException`, causing an immediate termination of the container. This ironically puts a greater load on ZK / Helix and can further increase the delays in future workflow submissions.\r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\nThe workflow timeouts need to be not hardcoded so that users can adjust the timeout based on their workflow needs and helix / zk cluster size. \r\n\r\nThis is just a single change as part of a series of changes for improving how Gobblin uses Helix. There are other issues that need to be addressed like:\r\n- Offline helix instance purging should occur before workflow submission\r\n- Helix lost node fencing should occur on each new ApplicationMaster, since Application masters do not hand over containers when an AM dies and is replaced\r\n- Helix workflows should have a configurable safeguard for how often a workflow can be resubmitted / replaced in order to prevent multiple external systems from doing unsafe concurrent mutations to a running workflow. A replanner should not occur too frequently because the work is redundant and the time between workflows is not sufficient for anything to change. \r\n\r\n#### Caveats:\r\nThis code is shared between GaaS and Kafka ETL code. The default timeout remains unchanged, and is backwards compatible. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    3. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    4. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-12T20:01:25Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T17:51:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-13T17:51:05Z","merged_at":"2023-04-13T17:51:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"44ed806c365fe6750ce7d46f4072ce68130ab93c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f359cacda6dbbb66b244aae170c3ba5d742b71f4","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-configure-workflow-timeout-GOBBLIN-1813","ref":"mh-configure-workflow-timeout-GOBBLIN-1813","sha":"f359cacda6dbbb66b244aae170c3ba5d742b71f4","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1816\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nGaaSObservabilityEvents can add the following fields to increase its effectiveness:\r\n1. Job properties, serialized in JSON. This enables the querying of specific job properties, which used to only be possible through MySQL on scheduled flows. Now it is possible to query for properties to solve questions such as `\"How much memory are GaaS pipelines requesting from Azkaban on average?\"`\r\n2. GaaS Instance ID, to differentiate between different clusters of GaaS which write to the same observability topic.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-12T01:34:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T20:47:30Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T17:17:09Z","merged_at":"2023-04-20T17:17:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"9640ef0d6e84b39841535d94b58f4998de97b58b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/95d5ff1ec4f893949d891aacd49410be6ce3edd5","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-flow-metadata-gaas-observability","ref":"add-flow-metadata-gaas-observability","sha":"95d5ff1ec4f893949d891aacd49410be6ce3edd5","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1814\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, the value of the MR config `mapreduce.map.failures.maxpercent` is hardcoded to 100%, which means even though mappers may fail, the job would still continue.  a customer seeks the ability to set `maxpercent` to 0, so if any mapper fails, the overall job too would fail.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nnone, as configuration is passed-through directly to MR, with interpretation there\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-12T00:10:49Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T00:54:46Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T00:54:46Z","merged_at":"2023-04-12T00:54:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7389a193bc3075612339aeff910f7d42b24812fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f80d048bfa33759a3be35d12cd82986c4cd83543","head":{"label":"phet:mrjoblauncher_mapper_failure_is_fatal","ref":"mrjoblauncher_mapper_failure_is_fatal","sha":"f80d048bfa33759a3be35d12cd82986c4cd83543","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1812] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1812\r\n\r\nThere was an error in a previous commit that changed mockito-core dependency to mockito-inline. Mockito-inline fundamentally changes how mocking works, and there were mockito was a compile dependency that broke downstream dependencies. \r\n\r\nIn general, since we are using the plugin approach (see https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3651/files#r1164827929 for an example), there's no reason to use mockito-inline as our dependency. In mockito 5, mockito-inline becomes the default but since we are still on java 8, we should just cross that bridge when we get there\r\n\r\nCheck below to see how the buildscan now no longer has mockito in compile path. Only test compile path\r\n\r\n[Buildscan](https://scans.gradle.com/s/wtnou474poohi/dependencies?dependencies=mockito&expandAll)\r\n<details>\r\n<img width=\"628\" alt=\"image\"

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1809\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd new version finder which does not actually list filepaths, and just constructs all unique path names/versions for a given lookback time with a given path partition pattern. This is useful for example with the iceberg cleanable datasets, which if decoupled from data files, should not depend on existence of the file path.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug in `DatasetCleaner` which sometimes causes the job to fail during shutdown and not print the actual issue with the job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test and tested in retention job\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-11T00:32:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T22:47:14Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T22:47:13Z","merged_at":"2023-04-11T22:47:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"c50b527caeba98785e552966016f15dbc614b4da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b7b97c7d89573b5b643ebc5df90114c8059d710a","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:lookback-version-finder","ref":"lookback-version-finder","sha":"b7b97c7d89573b5b643ebc5df90114c8059d710a","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1808\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTODO: Update documentation/dist folders to have the right version of Guava\r\n\r\nCurrently the version of Guava, 15.0, is from 2013, we want to introduce a newer version of Guava that should hopefully not cause as many issues with other dependencies, such as Guava 20.0 (2016).\r\n\r\nThis is the start of many version upgrades Gobblin will need to modernize and stay compatible with recent dependencies (e.g. GRPC) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nPasses unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-08T01:32:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T18:16:42Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T18:16:41Z","merged_at":"2023-04-12T18:16:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"234067109f63860da062fdbb8755c9afc6add9c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7414354a43fd1d8b1ff0003776274bc6ff0ce240","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:bump-to-guava-20","ref":"bump-to-guava-20","sha":"7414354a43fd1d8b1ff0003776274bc6ff0ce240","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1807] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1807\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nContext: https://groups.google.com/g/cascading-user/c/qAQvajapawI\r\n\r\nThe repo conjars.org is not reliably available and has issues with not being able to build due to dependency failure. Gobblin OSS relies on an older version of Apache Calcite that does not exist on mvnrepository. So we must continue to use conjars as our repo.\r\n\r\nThe repo https://conjars.wensel.net/ is more reliable and does not cause our github actions to fail\r\n\r\nDependency on hive 1.0.1 which has a dependency on calcite-core 0.9.2 means we have no choice in using this repo\r\n```\r\nproject :gobblin-hive-registration > com.linkedin.hive:hive-exec:1.0.1-avro > org.apache.calcite:calcite-core:0.9.2-incubating\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo find the necessary dependencies, I selectively added the necessary packages 1 by 1 using the `includeGroups` in gradle.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Example stack trace </summary>\r\n```\r\n> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':gobblin-binary-management:compileClasspath'.\r\n   > Could not find

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1805\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, Audit check is done for [currentWatermark, currentWatermark +1hour] window for quiet topics. However when the audit check for this window fails (due to an upstream bug in audit), the watermark never progress as the currentWatermark is never updated. To avoid this we keep progressing the watermark by checking the window [currentHour -1, currentHour] window\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Updated unit test to reflect this change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1800\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThere are 2 SLAs in GaaS flows:\r\n1. Job Start SLA, which measures the time in between when GaaS orchestrates a job to when it receives its first event from the job execution. This can catch scenarios such as container bootstrap time taking longer, event emission through Kafka failing, unresponsive executors.\r\n2. Flow SLA, which measures the e2e time of a flow from start to end. If the job is stuck or taking too long to run past this setting, it fails to save resources on the executor side.\r\n\r\nWhen a user defines `job.maxAttempts` in their GaaS flow, the expected behavior should be that these flows are retried to increase resiliency. \r\n\r\nThe original attempt at this solution had a bug where the DagManager was not sending the event `FLOW_RUNTIME_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` and `FLOW_START_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` to the JobStatusMonitor, but under review this solution could run into a bug where a flow can be blocked on service restart, if the event is never sent from the DagManager. Unless we also implemented retries with sending the SLA kill event, but in that scenario it's cleaner just to let the DagManager make the decisions regarding SLA kills.\r\n\r\nNormally the JobStatusRetriever makes all the decisions regarding job retries, when a job fails it receives a Job Failed event and attempts to retry the job after checking the current and maxAttempt of the event metadata. Once the job is retried, the DagNode within the DagManager updates the current Attempts. However, since SLA cancellations are determined by the DagManager, it would be more reliable to have the DagManager make the decisions regarding retries, since we know that the only check that needs to be done is the current and max Attempt (as we do not need to worry about out of order events or resume events).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests in `DagManagerFlowTest.java`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis patch adds an additional map `tableToCompletedPartitions` in the `State` class where it stores the table partition completeness information in memory, so that it can be later shared/retrieved by other `MetadataWriter` impl in the framework.\r\n\r\nThe data stored in `tableToCompletedPartitions` will be removed once consumed by other MetadataWriters, so that the `tableToCompletedPartitions` will not be growing indefinitely.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n`gradle :gobblin-iceberg:test`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T18:36:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-17T00:18:20Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T00:18:20Z","merged_at":"2023-03-17T00:18:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"7675dc43dd7128bb2daedb8c6b826e8fcc9104c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e46a4841d3ab020294629f99af802c6c1f8e2dcf","head":{"label":"rzhang10:add_completion_watermark_to_state","ref":"add_completion_watermark_to_state","sha":"e46a4841d3ab020294629f99af802c6c1f8e2dcf","user":{"login":"rzhang10","id":75445426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDQ1NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75445426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10","html_url":"https://github.com/rzhang10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":602803013,"node_id":"R_kgDOI-4LRQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"rzhang10/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rzhang10","id":75445426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDQ1NDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75445426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10","html_url":"https://github.com/rzhang10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzhang10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rzhang10/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1798\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable)\r\n**Problem:**\r\nNow with warm standby mode, we will write to mysql and read from mysql on separate hosts. Since we turn on the read replica for mysql databases, we do see read after write return null value and miss the processing for random flow request.\r\nSample error log: \r\n\r\n> \"The URI gobblin-flow:/gobblin-test discovered in SpecStore is missing in FlowCatalog, suspecting current modification on SpecStore\"\r\n\r\n**Solutions**\r\nWe want to add a backoff retry logic when we try to read from MySQL databases.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-09T00:45:49Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T20:57:52Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T20:57:52Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T20:57:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b1ca21b4f7e7643c30fdb61696050d622c1d205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7b4ea5292433ed2f5ca195b2f298b1611a81afe3","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1798","ref":"GOBBLIN-1798","sha":"7b4ea5292433ed2f5ca195b2f298b1611a81afe3","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1797\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe [unschedule feature](https://jarvis.corp.linkedin.com/codesearch/result/?name=FlowConfigResourceLocalHandler.java&path=gobblin-elr%2Fgobblin-restli%2Fgobblin-flow-config-service%2Fgobblin-flow-config-service-server%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fgobblin%2Fservice&reponame=linkedin%2Fgobblin-elr#62) sets a schedule to run Jan 1st of 2050 so far in advance that it will \"never run\" but potentially there are over 100k of these flows so we are loading and scheduling many unnecessary flows increasing the startup time. On initialization we add a check that verifies the next run of the flow is within a certain time frame (100 days by default) and loads it into the scheduler if it is within that time frame. We choose that default value under the assumption that we will redeploy GaaS at least every 100 days and then if we approach a far out scheduled flow we will load it into the Scheduler. However, in most cases uses schedule flows for near future or immediately and those will all be scheduled. This PR also renames metrics and adds helpful new ones. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test checks the functionality for calculating the number of days until the next run for a cron expression and evaluates cases of far out scheduled flows, regularly occurring, and blank flows (adhoc ones).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-08T01:30:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T20:33:30Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T20:33:30Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T20:33:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2d0c6389855731dcfd9f7962e503356b26deee7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2304dcc689fa7cc0ea394584ac5b006d0afd2a7a","head":{"label":"umustafi:improveDowntime","ref":"improveDowntime","sha":"2304dcc689fa7cc0ea394584ac5b006d0afd2a7a","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1796] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1796\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIn the event that container launch fails, Gobblin logs unhelpful information about the failure  and there is no observability with what went wrong. This code change will at least tell us what the command was for starting up the container. We will only print this if exit code `1`. See https://komodor.com/learn/how-to-fix-container-terminated-with-exit-code-1/ for a high level description of what this code tends to mean (ignore that it is for K8s, the same principle applies).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Exit Code 1 indicates that a container shut down, either because of an application failure or because the image pointed to an invalid file. In a Unix/Linux operating system, when an application terminates with Exit Code 1, the operating system ends the process using Signal 7, known as SIGHUP.\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n> \r\n> If you see containers terminated with Exit Code 1, you’ll need to investigate the container and its applications more closely to see what caused the failure. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nException from container-launch.\r\nContainer id: container_e45_1673332572982_1770008_01_034818\r\nExit code: 1\r\nShell output: main : command provided 1\r\nmain : run as user is gobblin\r\nmain : requested yarn user is gobblin\r\nGetting exit code file...\r\nCreating script paths...\r\nWriting pid file...\r\nWriting to tmp file /grid/g/tmp/yarn/nmPrivate/application_1673332572982_1770008/container_e45_1673332572982_1770008_01_034818/container_e45_1673332572982_1770008_01_034818.pid.tmp\r\nWriting to cgroup task files...\r\nCreating local dirs...\r\nLaunching container...\r\nGetting exit code file...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nMy tests ensure no regressions in build container command.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-07T22:52:55Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T17:52:59Z","closed_at":"2023-03-08T17:52:59Z","merged_at":"2023-03-08T17:52:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab62e72839bb4824b98a442de4dd1647284e880e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f3175b272c598c00237383d1bbb881b0233428ee","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-log-startup-command-GOBBLIN-1796","ref":"mh-log-startup-command-GOBBLIN-1796","sha":"f3175b272c598c00237383d1bbb881b0233428ee","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1795\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Compare facl when we compare and determine whether the file has the desired owner and permissions\r\n2. Make the common path configurable so that we won't try to set the owner and permission for the root dir every time \r\n3. Add setAcl and getAcl support in FileSystemDecorator so that we won't fail with operation not support exception\r\n4. Catch the exception when we fail to set the owner or group for the directory. Now we will fail the first container, and the second container will see dir exist and won't try to set it again, so we essentially succeed even if we fail to set the owner nowadays. And this behavior is the same as safeSetPathPermission() method for file permission. So change the code to directly catch the exception in the first place and log out the warning message. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-07T22:48:10Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T17:04:31Z","closed_at":"2023-03-13T17:04:31Z","merged_at":"2023-03-13T17:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"be6d46c2a117b1248d88d22cc64db5a12b802d16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/75c52e80167a1ff81cbd4aaef88a6e65f15a63ed","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1795","ref":"GOBBLIN-1795","sha":"75c52e80167a1ff81cbd4aaef88a6e65f15a63ed","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

scheduler\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1793 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd metrics to benchmark runtime of every piece of work involved to initialize the scheduler from the catalog to identify the bottleneck. We suspect the main time is taken to obtain specs from the mysqlstore, compile them, or schedule them but measure each part in case we are mistaken to identify a plan for improving the scheduler downtime during initialization. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nN/A only metrics added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-02T22:50:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T02:42:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T02:42:25Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T02:42:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d3095a5366f7e3adf63579c8c237854d5630990","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4f1b53f6acf5549d9b5eb92619adecb112346622","head":{"label":"umustafi:profileSchedulerInitialization","ref":"profileSchedulerInitialization","sha":"4f1b53f6acf5549d9b5eb92619adecb112346622","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nOur version of mockito is ancient (last updated 7 years ago!). The industry has moved on, and it's time to use a newer version of mockito. This updates to 4.11.0, the latest version of Mockito 4. Mockito 5.* requires Java 11 at a minimum.\r\n\r\nI've split up the diff into 3 sections to make reviewing easier. I can squash before merging after things have been reviewed:\r\n1. Initial commit updates the `Mockito` dependency, and excludes `mockito-all`. `Mockito-all` the deprecated naming for `mockito` that used to include utilities like `hamcrest` for argument `matchers`. `Mockito-core` 4.* has everything we need.\r\n  a.   Also as part of this commit, I replaced all instances of [deprecated `Matcher`](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.3.3/org/mockito/Matchers.html) to the new `ArgumentMatcher`\r\n  b. There was an instance where a class extended Matcher. The new way to do it is to instead `class FooBar implements ArgumentMatcher<...>`\r\n>Deprecated. \r\nUse [ArgumentMatchers](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.3.3/org/mockito/ArgumentMatchers.html). This class is now deprecated in order to avoid a name clash with Hamcrest org.hamcrest.Matchers class. This class will likely be removed in version 3.0.\r\n\r\n2. All instances of `anyObject` are now `any`. And any mocks that expected a null object are now just `any()` without a specified class. This is because the default behavior for `any` when a class is specified disallows null values.\r\n3. Update tests to deprecate powermock and remove all dependencies on powermock. (powermock doesn't work past mockito 2.* anyways since all its features were merged into `mockito-core`\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1792] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1792\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nShort list of quality of life improvements in Mockito 4:\r\n1. Features from PowerMock and Hamcrest are AFAIK all integrated natively in Mockito 4. For example, we had to use some nasty hacks to get powermock to work (since it itself is a bit of a hack). Those have since been removed and our tests are much cleaner\r\n2.  Strictness. Mocks by default are stricter (and configurable) so that unexpected stubs are caught (or can be configured to be lenient).\r\n3. final class mocking\r\n4. Subtly less buggy mocking engine (ByteBuddy over CGLIB)\r\n5. Improved type inference leveraging Java 8 and thus ability to check for type safety\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v4.0.0\r\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/dart-lang/mockito/+/refs/heads/master/upgrading-to-mockito-3.md\r\nhttps://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/What's-new-in-mockito-2\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests were updated accordingly. This is a scenario where we need to trust the CI :)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    6. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    7. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    8. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    9. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    10. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T05:10:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T01:17:28Z","closed_at":"2023-03-02T16:47:49Z","merged_at":"2023-03-02T16:47:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c84767ba79495b384d6b7f49d0c78695faf5b30a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8dbdbd3beae905f4c79ad53335ab2db265381afb","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-update-mockito","ref":"mh-update-mockito","sha":"8dbdbd3beae905f4c79ad53335ab2db265381afb","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

specs\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1791\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen a FlowSpec is compiled through the MultihopFlowCompiler, an error is added for every possible edge where there is at least one property mismatch. The cumulation of these errors for each edge means that from a size perspective there are a lot of strings stored redundantly in the flowspec.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to reduce the size of the FlowSpec, which is stored within the GobblinServiceJobScheduler, by clearing all of the errors from a flowspec if a flow is successfully compiled. Compilation failures are defined when the returned Dag is null\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T00:10:12Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T18:12:10Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T18:12:03Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T18:12:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb809747e265ac3b4da846a1d83c4cc850e5ae95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5fee3f698c0db3446afb6ddd5815526df52a4744","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:avoid-storing-flowspec-compilation-errors","ref":"avoid-storing-flowspec-compilation-errors","sha":"5fee3f698c0db3446afb6ddd5815526df52a4744","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1790\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIn GaaS, the observability events are still missing a few fields:\r\n1. Job Orchestration time\r\n\r\n2. Flowgraph edge ID\r\n\r\n3. Spec executor ID\r\n\r\n4. Azkaban user (if eligable)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the job start time field is inaccurate as it is set from multiple GTE events. We should be tracking it from a consistent point in the Gobblin Job, otherwise it will not be accurate when measuring the job runtime.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-22T18:33:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:38:07Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T19:38:01Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T19:38:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c6239f74853d3fd7f84fa3e33e9c402c3f470ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1e8c0b6fe57a5ffbf634ecebb91dba485f652f7f","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-fields-observability","ref":"add-fields-observability","sha":"1e8c0b6fe57a5ffbf634ecebb91dba485f652f7f","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1779] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1779\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nProblem Statement:\r\nGoal is to make it easy for users to filter out datasets with non optional unions. Avro and ORC flexible schema supports non optional unions. But Iceberg does not support these schemas. This can cause mismatched schemas when writing with different writers. e.g. writing with iceberg will write a struct but writing native orc writer will write as a uniontype \r\n- https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3632\r\n\r\nFuture users may want to implement similar complex filtering on the results of their dataset finders. And this filtering may be very complex. The goal is to make it easy for users to build their own filtering predicates.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n- \r\n\r\n- [DatasetsFinderFilteringDecorator.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3648/files#diff-a06c86cb0d75fff742e8b165e42a43b99283b7fd7a54e1cbc1e970d39c389f54)\r\n  - Decorator for any `DatasetsFinder` that accepts denylist and allowlist filters. In this case, we can specify that all tables with non optional unions are excluded or should be included \r\n- [DatasetHiveSchemaContainsNonOptionalUnion.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3648/files#diff-cd091eebaee68d566e9c4f6f00a74a9f14c7cbfec6ccef202a5aacd8ddb6e3a6)\r\n  - Predicate that fetches table from hive and performs check on if the schema contains a non optional union\r\n- [CheckedExceptionPredicate.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3648/files#diff-b6c16f111a3f6af91582a5a434dcb4e6df3db0e36a1beca4e232eed38c0ea455)\r\n  - Util functional interface for providing proper IO exceptions with these predicates (since often these predicates will be making IO calls that can fail) \r\n  - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/585298fb5ebc074f69c1b9db87de6186c4855b26/gobblin-utility/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/util/function/CheckedExceptionFunction.java\r\n  - See the above for the equivalent implementation for Function\r\n\r\nAlternative designs:\r\n- Alternatively, I could have directly modified any relevant sources or dataset finders to do the filtering there. The problem with that approach is that then we end up class specific configs that are niche and not generalizable.\r\n- There is also lots of business logic involved with complex filtering. Adding this business logic into a specific dataset finder would create spaghetti  super classes.\r\n- Gobblin is OSS and there are many implementations of dataset finders that are internal, which would require extra dev effort to implement filtering. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nHive metastore tests\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/220764654-3d437c95-1c67-4331-b344-00dcd7a1a613.png)\r\nDataset finder tests\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/220764943-8d35d077-d036-4bbb-84b1-7ac7e269e6f2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-22T11:34:05Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T23:59:03Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T22:01:33Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T22:01:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e8e3df03bf71ef42b0f774186fdc24288966294","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f260386b49cf7d608fcc53330802c834fa52fe9f","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-batch-complexunion-GOBBLIN-1779","ref":"mh-batch-complexunion-GOBBLIN-1779","sha":"f260386b49cf7d608fcc53330802c834fa52fe9f","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- The GobblinMCEWriter is defined as a public class, we should make its constructor `GobblinMCEWriter()` public too to allow usages outside of the package. For example, my current use case is allowing unit tests in other modules to construct a `GobblinMCEWriter` to set up a test infra, without the constructor being public, I have no other way to construct a object of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n`gradle

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nLet's improve the interface for state stores that Gobblin uses to storing watermarks and various other pieces of state. State stores like zookeeper have native methods for batch deletes that we cannot take advantage of with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for cleaning up no longer used watermarks in a state store. The size of a state store has physical limitations depending on the underlying implementation (e.g. ZK supports roughly ~10k tables per state store). And even migrating to a new state store requires a lot of operational burden / doesn't clean up the old state store.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n- Add a default method to the interface for backward compatibility in the OSS community\r\n- Use this method in the watermark based storage\r\n- Call batch delete in zk state store\r\n\r\nAlternate designs:\r\n- Create a new interface that extends the interface `StateStore` except it has a delete multiple tables method. The default approach is a much cleaner approach in terms of backwards compatibility / amount of code needed.\r\n- Add batch deletes as part of the watermark based storage, but this would be a hack since we'd just be calling delete with multiple threads\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1786\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently, we provide support for Iceberg based Distcp for Hive Catalogs. However, we now want to extend this functionality to any generic type of Iceberg Catalog and be able to perform Distcp operation from source to destination. As part of this initiative below are changes:\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- [ ] Introduce an abstract class called `BaseIcebergCatalog` to access` IcebergCatalog`'s companion catalog i.e. concrete implementation of `Catalog`\r\n- [ ] Extend the `IcebergCatalogFactory` to now instantiate Catalogs based on the specifier, defaulting to Hive\r\n- [ ] Add a layer of abstraction eg. `IcebergHiveCatalog` for pairing `IcebergCatalog` and its concrete implementation i.e. `HiveCatalog` in this case, so that methods like `newTableOps` are accessible\r\n- [ ] Add/Update properties to accommodate any generic Iceberg Catalog (previously only HiveCatalogs)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- [ ] Build successfully \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1784\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, the DagManager will poll a dag until it receives that the *job* has been completed/failed/cancelled, and then emit the flow event and clean up the dag. However, on service restart or crash, it is possible that the flow event never gets emitted. Since the dag is already cleaned up, this job status becomes stuck, and will never progress.\r\n\r\nTo address this scenario, this PR only cleans up dags when the cleanup function polls that the *flow status* is completed. If it does not receive the flow status that the job is completed within 3 minutes of the dag finishing all of its jobs, then it will re-emit the flow event in case it was lost. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Modified existing tests to the DagManagerTest class to ensure that the cleanup is working as expected on flow events\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-09T16:02:20Z","updated_at":"2023-02-16T20:19:20Z","closed_at":"2023-02-16T20:19:20Z","merged_at":"2023-02-16T20:19:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8be8f63a7b8d6b5d1feaf9e47f022cded2ac96b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5ce573d4f058a83b9822ae4bc448c8cfcbbb3b56","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:cleanup-dags-on-flowevent-dagmanager","ref":"cleanup-dags-on-flowevent-dagmanager","sha":"5ce573d4f058a83b9822ae4bc448c8cfcbbb3b56","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1783 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe seek to improve initialization time of the `GobblinServiceJobScheduler` upon restart or new leadership change by batching the mysql queries to get flow specs. Instead of making 1 mysql get call for each flow execution id, which scales extremely poorly with number of flows, we should group them to reduce number of calls and downtime. The entirety of the flow catalog is too large to load into memory for the `GobblinServiceJobScheduler`, so we use this batch functionality. \r\n\r\nThis implementation updates the `getSpecsAll(int start, int count)` and `(URI specUri)` method in the `SpecStore` interface that we use to achieve the batching to follow the implementation paradigm other methods of the interface follow. It also completes the method implementation for the `FSSpecStore` derived class of the `SpecStore`. This allows any consumer of the parent class `SpecStore` to use this functionality without caring about the specific implementation of the `SpecStore` used (as `GobblinServiceJobScheduler` does). \r\n\r\nNote that the introduction of the batch functionality adds a corner case to worry about where the scheduler is processing a large batch of N specs and and while iterating through this large N to add them to the scheduler, a user updates flowSpec N in the background so now the scheduler is about to add an older version of the spec in memory. To account for this case, I add a check for the `modification_time` of the flow spec before adding it to the scheduler. This is only needed when we first initialize the scheduler after a leadership change. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we ensure that the `SpecStoreChangeMonitor` is running before we set the `Scheduler` to active to ensure that we're able to accept _and_ process API requests while the Scheduler is being initialized. I tried a \"locking\" method of interaction between the Consumer and Scheduler to wait for the scheduler to be initialized before consuming specs, however this introduced the potential of deadlock and long waiting if the initialization takes time.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdate and passes existing paginated gets functionality. \r\nThe main testing for this functionality will be empirical testing to determine the batch size which results in decreasing the time needed for all the gets above. In general, the time should go down with a larger batch size but there may be an inflection point where we see diminishing returns or the memory required to store a large batch is excessive. I propose testing with batch size 100, 250, and 750 incrementally and using the time metrics emitted to settle on an appropriate size.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-09T00:47:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T21:26:35Z","closed_at":"2023-02-27T21:26:35Z","merged_at":"2023-02-27T21:26:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"af2a9c196d74b96d51dd8ee57b87cba0baceb9a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c4222fa74f7e78a6f5e418f3e3f807b3fc678ee1","head":{"label":"umustafi:paginatedGetFromSpecStore","ref":"paginatedGetFromSpecStore","sha":"c4222fa74f7e78a6f5e418f3e3f807b3fc678ee1","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1782\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- [ ] Flow statuses in pending_resume state were not getting executed since we incorrectly update the merge state for such flows\r\n- [ ] Thus, we now detect such flows and update their merge state so that they can proceed to their next state in the DAG\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- [ ] Added unit test for the fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-08T02:53:14Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T22:03:19Z","closed_at":"2023-02-08T22:03:19Z","merged_at":"2023-02-08T22:03:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"13faea46bd2f23999fb1bf9ea579296fb86d1e3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/87633bdc338e4b7196be4dc6c4f0c396876bf382","head":{"label":"meethngala:fix-merge-state-for-flow-pending-resume","ref":"fix-merge-state-for-flow-pending-resume","sha":"87633bdc338e4b7196be4dc6c4f0c396876bf382","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nHelix instances are purged during startup of the yarn service. This operation must be done without new helix instances being added or removed (i.e. the API call is not thread safe).\r\nThe current implementation blocks the yarn service from allocating initial containers while the helix instance purging is enabled, but it does not prevent other external services from requesting containers through its public methods.\r\nThese 2 services start up concurrently, and it's possible that the AutoScalingYarnManager starts up before the Yarn Service is completely finished purging. This could potentially lead to the AutoScalingYarnManager to requestContainers while the instances are still purging.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the yarn service start up synchronous and also adds a flag to indicate if start up is complete. This flag is switched when the yarn service has completed start up. The requestTargetNumberOfContainers function will read this flag to see if yarn service startup is completed. This prevents the requestContainers from executing prior to the completion of yarn service startup and prevents a race condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-07T23:14:58Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T02:02:19Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T02:02:19Z","merged_at":"2023-02-14T02:02:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"4382a008d365fe1b40327d0c10b85cb853a9f45a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0d82a1cd5b9d14cbda2ecdbbf896e8289c3f6042","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/Add_YarnServiceTests_Unit","ref":"andjiang/Add_YarnServiceTests_Unit","sha":"0d82a1cd5b9d14cbda2ecdbbf896e8289c3f6042","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nThis renaming is done as YarnServiceTest currently is disabled on CI testing. We would like to add unit tests in this file that are run during CI, but this requires removing some components. This rename is so we don't override YarnServiceTest Git history, simply a rename to YarnServiceIT. After renaming the tests to YarnServiceIT, there will be another PR that has a new file of the original name (YarnServiceTest.java) will be created, new unit tests will be created there, and those new tests will run in CI testing.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1780\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-07T21:39:29Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T22:54:26Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T22:54:26Z","merged_at":"2023-02-07T22:54:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"69f3f9c33c9679d723c447fbe626db8f1b7afa9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4309c2bb807a5b9edb5db6c00c1baf5096835ab6","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/YarnServiceTest_Rename","ref":"andjiang/YarnServiceTest_Rename","sha":"4309c2bb807a5b9edb5db6c00c1baf5096835ab6","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1773\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe used to check the quota when we accept flow for ad-hoc flow and run immediately flow. But we only use the same execution id for ad-hoc flow. So for a run immediately flow, we will check quota once with a random execution id, and then really run the job with a different execution id and forget the first one. This will cause us to double-check the quota for a run immediately flow and never release one of them. \r\nIn this PR:\r\n1. We change the behavior to only check the quota upon accepting the request when it's an adhoc job, and for run-immediate flow, we won't check the quota. If quota exceeds, we will fail the first job but still keep the config and schedule the job in the future\r\n2. When we see there is duplicate flow running and skip the exception, if it is an adhoc flow, we will release the quota for corresponding execution. \r\n3. We change the order where to make sure when increase/decrease quota, we use the same order to update the key value to avoid transaction deadlock\r\n4. We use shared data source to avoid too many thread issue\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    5. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    6. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    7. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    8. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    9. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-07T01:21:22Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T17:46:16Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T17:46:15Z","merged_at":"2023-02-09T17:46:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"8cb523dc79d61056db00a2ace4eabea58931a5ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3636/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3636/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3636/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e38658538b75bc876e21cce4e4e09dd7a96b6fcd","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1773","ref":"GOBBLIN-1773","sha":"e38658538b75bc876e21cce4e4e09dd7a96b6fcd","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1778\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNow dag managers have the assumption that it is the only process that can update mysql table and the in-memory state is always in sync with mysql. But we do notice that during the leader transforms period, it's possible that two dag manager can run concurrently and update the mysql db at the same time. \r\n\r\nTo address that, we need either add a lock to make sure only one dag manager is working at one time, or we need to have a housekeeping thread to periodically sync the in-memory state with the mysql table. After discussion, we choose to go with the later approach and we do have the assumption that GaaS submit jobs without specifying job.id, so jobs with same flow execution id will not share the staging dir and can be executed concurrently. \r\n\r\nBesides that, during adding test, I figure out there will be NPE if we try to set the dag manager as inactive, add a small fix for that as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nJust add a single thread for housekeeping so will not affect other functions. Also add unit test to make sure we close the thread when de-active DagManager to avoid memory leak \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-02T23:02:46Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T22:16:24Z","closed_at":"2023-02-06T22:16:24Z","merged_at":"2023-02-06T22:16:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e0a2be76c18346a11b5bd9717a42008708c792c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4e08c19dcde0eed567581628b8a66055e6841635","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOOBLIN-1778","ref":"GOOBLIN-1778","sha":"4e08c19dcde0eed567581628b8a66055e6841635","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1775] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1775\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n**Problem Statement:**\r\nThe way GMIP handles Hive has 2 issues:\r\n1. `drop_file` GMCE creates a table even if it does not already currently exist. \r\n2. Schema issues when creating tables throws an exception and the running container fails. Upon restart, the container will resume from the same watermark and the container will again face an exception. (i.e. when there are schema issues they should be skipped over instead of aborted). These GMCE's are not possible to process, causing indefinite starvation\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- The `HiveMetadataWriter#write` method is a bit hard to read and [mixes layers of abstraction](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:single_level_of_abstraction). I've extracted some of the different methods and added comments above methods that had subtle significance. I'm not entirely happy with the way the function looks, but I think this is an improvement from before\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n```\r\nERROR [HiveMetadataWriter] Failed to create table. Skipping this event\r\njava.io.IOException: Error in creating or altering Hive table testTable in db dbWhichDoesNotExist\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.hive.metastore.HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister.createTableIfNotExists(HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister.java:469)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.hive.metastore.HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister.createTableIfNotExists(HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister.java:414)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.createTable(HiveMetadataWriter.java:252)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.hive.writer.HiveMetadataWriter.write(HiveMetadataWriter.java:207)\r\n```\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/217352903-ff851817-d2cd-48b8-885b-612a97ef0e29.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    4. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T05:04:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T00:56:18Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T00:56:18Z","merged_at":"2023-02-14T00:56:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc8076bfb9f008b98692ee0797c94e4641f89e0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0493257bc9b688e086358bc3804ee9dfcc1f5a5c","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-gmip-no-fail-create-table-GOBBLIN-1775","ref":"mh-gmip-no-fail-create-table-GOBBLIN-1775","sha":"0493257bc9b688e086358bc3804ee9dfcc1f5a5c","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1774] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1774\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nProblem Statement:\r\n>     Non-optional union: A union type with more than one non-null option type\r\n>     e.g. [“int”, “string”] or [“null”, “int”, “string”]\r\n>     Alternate phrasing:\r\n>     A schema where there 's a union type of >= 2 branches which are non null.\r\n>     [int, null] - no\r\n>     [int, string] - yes\r\n>     [int, string, null] yes\r\n\r\n- Iceberg, unlike Hive, does not support non optional `uniontypes` (i.e. [uniontypes](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/hive/languagemanual+types#LanguageManualTypes-UnionTypesunionUnionTypes) that can be null). These are supported as struct types instead.\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/189\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1046\r\n- This util will be used across GMIP and compaction to handle separate edge cases for non optional unions, so special workarounds are necessary to have datasets with both heterogeneous schemas (e.g. a seamless view that contains legacy schemas and new iceberg compatible schemas that use struct).\r\n- Iceberg uses a similar pattern to Trino to represent complex uniontypes as struct. See https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/3483\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T22:32:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T20:26:41Z","closed_at":"2023-02-13T20:26:41Z","merged_at":"2023-02-13T20:26:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bc9df52abb48054e552348fcb1a47bf62286870","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/91aaa25a9edf91dd0d6442498813c9dd796aaf98","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-complex-union-util-GOBBLIN-1774","ref":"mh-complex-union-util-GOBBLIN-1774","sha":"91aaa25a9edf91dd0d6442498813c9dd796aaf98","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1771\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nLarge datasets (multiple terabytes), depending on their jobs, can send a large number of repetitive logs for failing dataset states and cleaning up the dataset state.\r\n\r\nFor failed dataset states, this PR will only print the unique exceptions for each taskState, and not log repeated errors for each workunit on the errors in the taskstate.\r\n\r\nWhen cleaning up the writer directories, we also can just log when we are deleting the parent directories, not necessarily each subdirectory which can be a large number. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-27T01:00:37Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T18:24:39Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T18:24:39Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T18:24:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"667d79787ae2f5ca2a22f5d023a6e89a00874835","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/54f4c95371edc1fed1698887737ec9fd56042f2c","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:reduce-failure-cleanup-logs","ref":"reduce-failure-cleanup-logs","sha":"54f4c95371edc1fed1698887737ec9fd56042f2c","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1770\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen looking into the IssueRepository before the creation of GaaSObservabilityEvents, many issues do not populate their fields for details and summary. This is because the Issue details are composed of a stack trace, but since Issues can be composed of warn/error logs and stack traces, it is not guaranteed that every issue has a corresponding stack trace.\r\n\r\nHowever, from investigation it looks like the automated troubleshooter will always populate the issue severity, code, and summary.\r\n\r\nThis PR accounts for this when creating a GaaSObservabilityEvent by modifying the schema to allow both null and String/Map values.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe unit test will take the generate the event and attempt to serialize this against the schema. Previously, this would fail with a `NullPointerException`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-27T00:11:37Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T21:13:48Z","closed_at":"2023-01-27T00:44:37Z","merged_at":"2023-01-27T00:44:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"240aee21178b02f1d59a6401cfb27df7912f9cb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ffc186b45bfc24a574e3f14ddbb8e1d71d0d9e6d","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-observability-event-issue-npe","ref":"fix-observability-event-issue-npe","sha":"ffc186b45bfc24a574e3f14ddbb8e1d71d0d9e6d","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

to debug\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1769\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen reporting GobblinTrackingEvents, for large jobs they emit a larger number of events. This causes the following line to be emitted continuously:\r\n```\r\nlog.info(\"Trigger immediate run to report the event since queue is almost full\"); \r\n```\r\nThis log is not very useful to end users as it was originally created to debug emitting of GTE.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the log to become a debug log.\r\nThe import changes are due to the old imports not conforming to the Gobblin Code style guide that is published https://gobblin.apache.org/docs/developer-guide/CodingStyle/\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-24T21:44:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T21:13:45Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T23:22:52Z","merged_at":"2023-01-24T23:22:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ac032d551bfde63e42b80252456d948d22123e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e6d1993706179de3f70eaa3a785086e3a8086f31","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:change-log-event-report-to-debug","ref":"change-log-event-report-to-debug","sha":"e6d1993706179de3f70eaa3a785086e3a8086f31","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1753\r\n\r\nSpecifically name each Hikari connection pool created, for traceability\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nsince stores are independently configurable, and it's possible for each to use a different DB, we expect a connection pool per store (even when several may physically utilize the same DB as each other).  To discern which store has created which pool, this change has each datasource (pool) provider name the pool after itself.  in the absence of explicitly specifying a pool name all would be given a monotonically increasing name, like `HikariPool-##`.  that unfortunately gives no indication of which pool relates to which store.  Knowing that may aid in diagnosing whether a given store provider has created more pools than anticipated, as typically there should be only one per store.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T04:06:55Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T18:08:52Z","closed_at":"2023-01-23T18:08:52Z","merged_at":"2023-01-23T18:08:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1be38bf65526f1cc8ca151536831e981b183da1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e3c489412bcca9b90b7fd03079c40a2b1527d2c3","head":{"label":"phet:hikari_specific_pool_names","ref":"hikari_specific_pool_names","sha":"e3c489412bcca9b90b7fd03079c40a2b1527d2c3","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1766 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nModify event for change stream events to add the transaction identifier and produceTimestamp. Use the transaction identifier instead of timestamp to dedup events as \"at least once\" delivery may result in multiple change stream events with different timestamps for the same row update in mysql. Instead use the timestamp to emit a metric measuring the time between producing the event and consuming on our monitor. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-14T02:29:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T21:20:22Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T21:20:22Z","merged_at":"2023-01-24T21:20:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"5db16216558f23876a3a5aa77661341559e63a8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/53cad739b95cff26744c04989e1845808b881032","head":{"label":"umustafi:lagMetricsForChangestream","ref":"lagMetricsForChangestream","sha":"53cad739b95cff26744c04989e1845808b881032","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1765\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe want to add support so that when user specify a dir in manifest file, we will blindly sync the metadata for that dir regardless the modification time.\r\nThis change include:\r\n1. add config to support whether we want preserve mod time for dir and by default it's true\r\n2. Change the FileAwareInpuSTreamWriter so that during commit, when we see the output path already exist and CopyableFile is one directory, we won't rename/overwrite the target dir incase we overwrite the file that already been copied in the same job.   We still want to add this dir as copyableFile because only in this case, we can make sure publisher will be executed even there is no other file to copy and handle the metadata sync for dirs. \r\n3. Change the shouldCopy method in manifest to \r\n  a. Always copy dir\r\n  b. Always copy file if source has newer version\r\n  c. Copy file is source and dst have same version but target permission is different on dst. (this is because chown won't change the modification time)\r\n  d. never copy file if dst has newer version\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit test all pass. Also test the real manifest copy job and verify that we can sync metadata for dir without affecting the files already existed in the dir\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

It differs from GobblinTrackingEvents as it runs once per job pipeline, and it designed to be easily queryable and alert on. It will have fixed schema, unlike GobblinTrackingEvents, which puts a map of job information into the `metadata` field which may or may not exist and is dependent on the execution framework to provide. This makes GTE more frail and difficult for users and other systems to reliably read from this event.\r\n\r\nWe want to emit this observability event from GaaS by deriving it from a job's job status. Since this feature is Experimental and WIP, it is not expected to fill out all of the fields immediately.\r\n\r\nThis creates a template for a configurable GaaSObservabilityEventProducer, and the emission logic can be implemented by any derived class that will define the message sending mechanism. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHiveMaterializerTest is blocking CI/CD on Github, but works locally\r\nFrom a lengthy investigation it seems to have some issue with creating the database on the Github runner, I cannot pinpoint what is happening exactly but the issue is that the HiveDbcpConnector and the HiveMetastore client java class are not reading/writing to the same locations, this is causing issues that is very difficult to debug.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables this test on CI/CD until more investigation can be done\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-20T19:04:48Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T21:13:45Z","closed_at":"2022-12-20T21:48:32Z","merged_at":"2022-12-20T21:48:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d16b772d5902ec24a3f47a433347ec647d835fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/97a938cf3b08bbd814d11242649d929879138db5","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:disable-flaky-hive-materializer-test-ci-cd","ref":"disable-flaky-hive-materializer-test-ci-cd","sha":"97a938cf3b08bbd814d11242649d929879138db5","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1755\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe want to support extended ACLs within for any type of file based distcp that is initiated. The previous of Hadoop i.e. 2.4 in Gobblin has this limitation since there wasn't APIs in the Hadoop FileSystem that we could leverage. Thus, as part of this PR, I built on top of our Hadoop upgrade version to 2.10 and provided the support for extended ACLs. \r\n\r\nThis PR now allows us to preserve ACLs as well during a distcp along with its previous other attributes which includes and not limited to: file permissions with sticky bit, owner, group, mod times, etc. We preserve these ACLs for the all the directories/paths that were created as part of the distcp operation on the destination. Having said that, the user can limit the ancestor directory up to which they want to preserve these attributes. All of the attribute preservation for the FileSystem is configurable including the current support for ACLs. Below are key changes made as part of this PR:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- [ ] Added new preserve attributes for supporting extended ACLs\r\n- [ ] Extended OwnerAndPermissions to provide ACL support\r\n- [ ] Updated CopyableFile to include ACLs if the preserve attribute for ACL is set and also maintain the same for ancestors\r\n- [ ] Updated FileAwareInputStreamDataWriter to set ACLs\r\n- [ ] Added unit tests for preserving ACLs at both File Path level and all of the ancestors that were created as part of the copy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- [ ] build successfully\r\n- [ ] Added unit tests to confirm the support for extended ACLs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-14T06:13:58Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T21:18:03Z","closed_at":"2023-02-08T21:18:02Z","merged_at":"2023-02-08T21:18:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd8f6e332312fc0ba186a3ca3bbcf0c13216ea30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d8b378d7436984840f70c39c4024d002217b3602","head":{"label":"meethngala:support-acls-for-file-based-distcp","ref":"support-acls-for-file-based-distcp","sha":"d8b378d7436984840f70c39c4024d002217b3602","user":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":526331617,"node_id":"R_kgDOH18u4Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"meethngala/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"meethngala","id":22387809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzg3ODA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22387809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala","html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meethngala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/meethngala/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1759\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Adds more detailed logging when attempting to resolve flow configuration\r\n- Logs errors for both variable substitution as well as flow template mismatches/errors\r\n- Provides the possible and expected values as well as missing variables in the configuration to resolve to an edge:\r\n```\r\nFlow was not compiled successfully. Compilation errors encountered (Sorted by relevance): \r\nERROR 1 of single-step data movement: {\"<edge>:{\"<job>\":[\"Could not resolve substitution to a value: ${key.location}\"]}}\r\nERROR 2 of single-step data movement: {\"<edge>\":{\"flowTemplateErrors\":[\"gobblin.flow.input.dataset.descriptor.isRetentionApplied is mismatched. User input: true. Expected value false.\"]}}\r\nERROR 1 of multi-step data movement: {\"<edge>\":{\"<job>\":[\"Could not resolve substitution to a value: ${version.finder}\"]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- Changes tests to test for number of errors returned or checks that no errors were reported instead of just true or false during flow compilation process\r\n- Rather than just checking for the final result, also checks for the size of the error list\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-13T06:25:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-20T22:32:58Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T20:44:52Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T20:44:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"34c20ff70879ff1a8baf997932199abef82b3571","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/60842df16689b82de7fe65c06f66c215b47e52dc","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/flowConfigErrorReporting","ref":"andjiang/flowConfigErrorReporting","sha":"60842df16689b82de7fe65c06f66c215b47e52dc","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1750\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nUsers of GaaS have a difficult time monitoring their flows. Regular metrics do not have the cardinality needed to effectively determine the status of a pipeline, and GTE are too broad and are hard for users to create meaningful queries from.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up the schema of an observability event which would be used as a monitoring baseline in GaaS\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-28T19:02:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T19:11:40Z","closed_at":"2023-01-03T19:11:39Z","merged_at":"2023-01-03T19:11:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d1461f43d181b18675b52a7de7c411346b867cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/78a451ba8e50fe01c7e0ebe510ae1deeda694b8a","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-gaas-observability-event","ref":"add-gaas-observability-event","sha":"78a451ba8e50fe01c7e0ebe510ae1deeda694b8a","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1749\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading Avro to 1.9.2, reading and writing xz-compressed Avro file fails by default. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI updated AvroHdfsDataWriterTest to ensure that all codecs are supported\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1746\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis is to support copy in same cluster but between different volume. We add the fs.uri in dataset descriptor to make sure it's a scalable way for us to config the file system uri.  By default, we use the fs.uri from data node\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test, also test deploy GaaS locally with new datapack\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-19T00:25:31Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T21:36:42Z","closed_at":"2022-11-23T21:36:42Z","merged_at":"2022-11-23T21:36:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"12ba4035b13502d8955825c167f0e4d088032e95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3605/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3605/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3605/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/756b494f33c57c959aee6544770f9758708373f2","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1746","ref":"GOBBLIN-1746","sha":"756b494f33c57c959aee6544770f9758708373f2","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1744] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1744\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nI made 2 helix null checks in 2 separate spots\r\n\r\n\r\n#### (1) HelixAssignedParticipantCheck\r\n----------\r\nIn production, we've seen that the helix assigned participant check failed due to helix issues but not due to a split brain. When helix returns null, this actually means that the data does not exist. This is an unexpected case and we can assume that Helix itself is having issues (i.e. not a Gobblin side issue).\r\n\r\nI am adding this log because if the Helix assigned participant check fails, this is most likely a Helix issue but it's not immediately obvious what the exact issue is. I've added 2 likely scenarios we've seen internally as common scenarios where oncall has seen this as the rootcause.\r\n\r\n#### (2) HelixUtils#getWorkflowIdsFromJobNames(HelixManager helixManager, Collection<String> jobNames)\r\n----------\r\n```\r\nkafka-streaming-replanner-tracking INFO - Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\nkafka-streaming-replanner-tracking INFO - at org.apache.gobblin.cluster.HelixUtils.getWorkflowIdsFromJobNames(HelixUtils.java:327)\r\nkafka-streaming-replanner-tracking INFO - at org.apache.gobblin.prototype.kafka.replanner.GobblinHelixClusterJob.getWorkflowIdFromJobName(GobblinHelixClusterJob.java:142)\r\nkafka-streaming-replanner-tracking INFO - at org.apache.gobblin.prototype.kafka.replanner.GobblinHelixClusterJob.getJobActive(GobblinHelixClusterJob.java:175)\r\nkafka-streaming-replanner-tracking INFO - ... 54 more\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a similar case where Helix returns a null value. This can be caused when this util is called during a replanner / restart of the helix workflow. It can also be caused by a helix data consistency issue. The code doesn't expect a null and will fail with NPE. It is much better to fail with a more descriptive exception. The code calling this util already retries, so this is to avoid any confusion about if this is an infra issue or a bug in our code. \r\n\r\nI've also made a small change to how we fetch the workflow configs. In the original implementation, we call the getWorkflowConfig() again after getting the workflow map. I think this is causing some weird inconsistent state. We get a workflow and then if it is somehow deleted by the time we call getWorkflowConfig(), then we end up with a null value. \r\n\r\nThere's really no reason to split up the call since they do the same thing and we are just being wasteful by making extra zookeeper reads. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n`HelixAssignedParticipantCheckTest`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existing test in helix assigned participant check triggers this because it returns a null participant from mock helix. I've attached the corresponding log output that we should see.\r\n```\r\n2022-11-17 18:23:02 PST ERROR [pool-35-thread-1] org.apache.gobblin.cluster.HelixAssignedParticipantCheck 143 - The current assigned participant is null. This implies that \r\n\t\t(a)Helix failed to write to zookeeper, which is often caused by lack of compression leading / exceeding zookeeper jute max buffer size (Default 1MB)\r\n\t\t(b)Helix reassigned the task (unlikely if this current task has been running without issue. Helix does not have code for reassigning \"running\" tasks)\r\nNote: This logic is true as of Helix version 1.0.2 and ZK version 3.6\r\n```\r\nThis test is not run in CI so I attached a screenshot below\r\n<img width=\"644\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/202632301-99c01be8-7be0-4fab-a97e-3c956536ae75.png\">\r\n\r\n`HelixUtilsTest`\r\n\r\nI've also added tests in the `HelixUtilsTest`. I mock Helix API responses and replicate a workflow -> job -> task DAG. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/211682952-c99296a9-3bb0-4ab9-8ee3-e89c385e279c.png)\r\n```\r\norg.apache.gobblin.cluster.GobblinHelixUnexpectedStateException: Received null workflow config from Helix.

The workflowIdFromJobName is used in the replanner to check the helix workflow to restart. So I am pretty sure I didn't break anything. Not sure if this integration test runs in the CI so I've added a screenshot of the tests passing.\r\n<img width=\"492\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/202630933-0b95550c-f082-4794-aaf8-463b3043242c.png\">\r\n\r\n`GobblinHelixJobSchedulerTest`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/211682120-99c8c3a2-6deb-4679-b267-241d61e117fe.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.
