The following changes are introduced:\r\n\r\n1. `ExprValue` now uses the actual class instead of the class name as its type. This should give some more flexibility with generating code in the future.\r\n2. Renamed `StatementValue` to `SimpleExprValue`. The statement concept is broader then an expression (untyped and it cannot be on the right hand side of an assignment), and this was not really what we were using it for. I have added a top level `JavaCode` trait that can be used in the future to reinstate (no pun intended) a statement a-like code fragment.\r\n3. Added factory methods to the `JavaCode` companion object to make it slightly less verbose to create `JavaCode`/`ExprValue` objects. This is also what makes the diff quite large.\r\n4. Added one more factory method to `ExprCode` to make it easier to create code-less expressions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2018-04-10T14:36:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T14:56:51Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T12:15:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"162d20362eb82e13c4bcee354cb66f4946962ae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6abd22807a728fe878043cfd30dea791d51575f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-23951","ref":"SPARK-23951","sha":"e6abd22807a728fe878043cfd30dea791d51575f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkContext submitted a map stage from `submitMapStage` to `DAGScheduler`, \r\n`markMapStageJobAsFinished` is called only in (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L933 and https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1314);\r\n\r\nBut think about below scenario:\r\n1. stage0 and stage1 are all `ShuffleMapStage` and stage1 depends on stage0;\r\n2. We submit stage1 by `submitMapStage`;\r\n3. When stage 1 running, `FetchFailed` happened, stage0 and stage1 got resubmitted as stage0_1 and stage1_1;\r\n4. When stage0_1 running, speculated tasks in old stage1 come as succeeded, but stage1 is not inside `runningStages`. So even though all splits(including the speculated tasks) in stage1 succeeded, job listener in stage1 will not be called;\r\n5. stage0_1 finished, stage1_1 starts running. When `submitMissingTasks`, there is no missing tasks. But in current code, job listener is not triggered.\r\n\r\nWe should call the job listener for map stage in `5`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot added yet.","created_at":"2018-04-10T03:39:33Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T02:16:24Z","closed_at":"2018-04-17T13:58:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ac2b285279a9eaeaba35d71e5b85ecf955ad8a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42a9b2e2a4f23401affbf53f207a7c98d4da0bce","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-23948","ref":"SPARK-23948","sha":"42a9b2e2a4f23401affbf53f207a7c98d4da0bce","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr fixed code so that `cache` could prevent any jobs from being triggered.\r\nFor example, in the current master, an operation below triggers a actual job;\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(10000000000L)\r\n  .filter('id > 1000)\r\n  .orderBy('id.desc)\r\n  .cache()\r\n```\r\nThis triggers a job while the cache should be lazy. The problem is that, when creating `InMemoryRelation`, we build the RDD, which calls `SparkPlan.execute` and may trigger jobs, like sampling job for range partitioner, or broadcast job.\r\n\r\nThis pr removed the code to build a cached `RDD` in the constructor of `InMemoryRelation` and added `CachedRDDBuilder` to lazily build the `RDD` in `InMemoryRelation`. Then, the first call of `CachedRDDBuilder.cachedColumnBuffers` triggers a job to materialize the cache in  `InMemoryTableScanExec` .\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `CachedTableSuite`.","created_at":"2018-04-10T02:55:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T11:10:00Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T11:10:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e49a6402fa06ccb12d1eee27cfac8c3dbee7b77d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3cce89f9328c10809eba729dbe276bc4b07fcdd","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-23880","ref":"SPARK-23880","sha":"a3cce89f9328c10809eba729dbe276bc4b07fcdd","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-23525 added the ability to `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN` for simple COMMENT only changes.  For safety, column changes are generally restricted.  However, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` is safe and allowed.  In order to add columns to a nested struct type, we must run an `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN` command, since struct type DDL look like single top level columns with a complex type.\r\n\r\nGiven on origin column declared like\r\n```\r\nnested struct<s1:string>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch allows users to issue SQL DDL like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE COLUMN nested nested struct<s1:string,s2:string>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto add sub columns to a struct.  It does this by recursing over StructTypes, and comparing dataTypes for each shared field between the origin table and the new destination type.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`testChangeColumn` in DDLSuite.scala and was amended and tests were added\r\nto HiveDDLSuite.scala  to include tests for altering struct type columns.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-09T19:15:16Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T21:30:34Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T00:07:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b0216ea8b37aa347025aec96f98365175643c4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1bf6730f41ab6cba6c7855ed002a9aeb4a273c0c","head":{"label":"ottomata:SPARK-23890","ref":"SPARK-23890","sha":"1bf6730f41ab6cba6c7855ed002a9aeb4a273c0c","user":{"login":"ottomata","id":1626054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjYwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1626054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128819412,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjg4MTk0MTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"ottomata/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ottomata","id":1626054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjYwNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1626054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata","html_url":"https://github.com/ottomata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottomata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ottomata/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCode generation for the `Add` and `Subtract` expressions was not done using the `BinaryArithmetic.doCodeGen` method because these expressions also support `CalendarInterval`. This leads to a bit of duplication.\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of that duplication by adding `calendarIntervalMethod` to `BinaryArithmetic` and doing the code generation for `CalendarInterval` in `BinaryArithmetic` instead.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `PartitioningAwareFileIndex` accepts an optional parameter `userPartitionSchema`. If provided, it will combine the inferred partition schema with the parameter.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n1. to get `userPartitionSchema`, we need to  combine inferred partition schema with `userSpecifiedSchema`\r\n2. to get the inferred partition schema, we have to create a temporary file index.\r\n\r\nOnly after that, a final version of `PartitioningAwareFileIndex` can be created.\r\n\r\nThis can be improved by passing `userSpecifiedSchema` to `PartitioningAwareFileIndex`.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement, we can reduce redundant code and avoid parsing the file partition twice. \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-08T18:56:22Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T13:59:03Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T16:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9863b450c824eb7e7441d2a232ee4a59604f215c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12ac191cb29f4ba1f817abffc8c7422efe837b38","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:PartitioningAwareFileIndex","ref":"PartitioningAwareFileIndex","sha":"12ac191cb29f4ba1f817abffc8c7422efe837b38","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

The multiplication of large positive integer values may set one to MSB.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive has been supporting for a while the ability of dropping partitions using any kind of comparison operator on them. Spark so far is supporting only dropping partitions by exact values. For instance, Spark doesn't support:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE mytable DROP PARTITION(mydate < '2018-04-06')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PR adds the support to this syntax too.\r\n\r\nThe PR takes input from the effort in #19691 by @DazhuangSu. As such, this closes #19691.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUTs to be added\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-06T16:26:34Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T06:52:16Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T00:08:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ef0d3120d4d258bf315e5bd68890209081d7466","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96760614d5d2cd31a75982d28948a28376f67964","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-23866","ref":"SPARK-23866","sha":"96760614d5d2cd31a75982d28948a28376f67964","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a bug in:\r\n```\r\n/** Check whether a task is currently running an attempt on a given host */\r\n private def hasAttemptOnHost(taskIndex: Int, host: String): Boolean = {\r\n   taskAttempts(taskIndex).exists(_.host == host)\r\n }\r\n```\r\nThis will ignore hosts which only have finished attempts, so we should check whether the attempt is currently running on the given host. \r\n\r\nAnd it is possible for a speculative task to run on a host where another attempt failed here before.\r\nAssume we have only two machines: host1, host2.  We first run task0.0 on host1. Then, due to  a long time waiting for task0.0, we launch a speculative task0.1 on host2. And, task0.1 finally failed on host1, but it can not re-run since there's already  a copy running on host2. After another long time waiting, we launch a new  speculative task0.2. And, now, we can run task0.2 on host1 again, since there's no more running attempt on host1.\r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\nAfter discussion, we simply make the comment be consistent the method's behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded.","created_at":"2018-04-06T16:02:05Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T05:29:08Z","closed_at":"2018-04-23T20:41:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca99054e65ab4f5420f1ffee9fb9864381b7faf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e44d80b70985f9be23ccafd0868e29c946ab4a5a","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-23888","ref":"SPARK-23888","sha":"e44d80b70985f9be23ccafd0868e29c946ab4a5a","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CachedKafkaConsumer` in the project streaming-kafka-0-10 is designed to maintain a pool of KafkaConsumers that can be reused. However, it was built with the assumption there will be only one thread trying to read the same Kafka TopicPartition at the same time. This assumption is not true all the time and this can inadvertently lead to ConcurrentModificationException.\r\n\r\nHere is a better way to design this. The consumer pool should be smart enough to avoid concurrent use of a cached consumer. If there is another request for the same TopicPartition as a currently in-use consumer, the pool should automatically return a fresh consumer.\r\n\r\n- There are effectively two kinds of consumer that may be generated\r\n  - Cached consumer - this should be returned to the pool at task end\r\n  - Non-cached consumer - this should be closed at task end\r\n- A trait called `KafkaDataConsumer` is introduced to hide this difference from the users of the consumer so that the client code does not have to reason about whether to stop and release. They simply call `val consumer = KafkaDataConsumer.acquire` and then `consumer.release`.\r\n- If there is request for a consumer that is in-use, then a new consumer is generated.\r\n- If there is request for a consumer which is a task reattempt, then already existing cached consumer will be invalidated and a new consumer is generated. This could fix potential issues if the source of the reattempt is a malfunctioning consumer.\r\n- In addition, I renamed the `CachedKafkaConsumer` class to `KafkaDataConsumer` because is a misnomer given that what it returns may or may not be cached.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new stress test that verifies it is safe to concurrently get consumers for the same TopicPartition from the consumer pool.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-06T13:26:02Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T20:48:34Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T20:48:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72b95fa50baffcec4b4b59e9c42fdd1b43edf062","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6cd67c6ac7b948eb791cc4871477ab0b1df4fcad","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-19185","ref":"SPARK-19185","sha":"6cd67c6ac7b948eb791cc4871477ab0b1df4fcad","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes an existing UT [`writeToOutputStreamUnderflow()`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/common/unsafe/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/unsafe/types/UTF8StringSuite.java#L519-L532) in `UTF8StringSuite`.\r\n\r\nAs discussed [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19222#discussion_r177692142), the behavior of this test looks surprising. This test seems to access metadata area of the JVM object where is reserved by `Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET`.\r\n\r\nThis test is introduced thru #16089 by @NathanHowell. More specifically, [the commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16089/commits/27c102deb1701fe62f776fe4da61dac959270b73) `Improve test coverage of UTFString.write` introduced this UT. However, I cannot find any discussion about this UT.\r\n\r\nI think that it would be good to exclude this UT.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public void writeToOutputStreamUnderflow() throws IOException {\r\n    // offset underflow is apparently supported?\r\n    final ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n    final byte[] test = \"01234567\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 1; i <= Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET; ++i) {\r\n      new UTF8String(\r\n        new ByteArrayMemoryBlock(test, Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET - i, test.length + i))\r\n          .writeTo(outputStream);\r\n      final ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(outputStream.toByteArray(), i, test.length);\r\n      assertEquals(\"01234567\", StandardCharsets.UTF_8.decode(buffer).toString());\r\n      outputStream.reset();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe test case JobCancellationSuite.\"interruptible iterator of shuffle reader\" has been flaky because `KillTask` event is handled asynchronously, so it can happen that the semaphore is released but the task is still running.\r\nActually we only have to check if the total number of processed elements is less than the input elements number, so we know the task get cancelled.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new test case still fails without the purposed patch, and succeeded in current master.","created_at":"2018-04-06T07:42:12Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T01:30:56Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T17:23:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a1f8868a607067820bf4eac4669fc54cb4c368f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c7d1c749ce54eada6e483cb64b8d32cb01e445d","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:JobCancellationSuite","ref":"JobCancellationSuite","sha":"2c7d1c749ce54eada6e483cb64b8d32cb01e445d","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to use `MemoryBlock` in `TaskMemoryManager` and `UnsafeSorter` related classes. There are two advantages to use `MemoryBlock`.\r\n\r\n1. Has clean API calls rather than using a Java array or `PlatformMemory`\r\n2. Improve runtime performance of memory access instead of using `Object` with `Platform.get/put...`.\r\n\r\n** ToDo: Add benchmark result **\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUsed existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new config `spark.kubernetes.executor.volumes` taking a values of the form  `hostPath:containerPath[:ro|rw][,...]`; where  `hostPath` is the path for the executor pod volume, `containerPath` is the mount path and `ro` is read-only mode.\r\n\r\nThe use case is to enable short-circuit writes to distributed storage on k8s. The Alluxio File System uses domain sockets to enable short-circuit writes from the client to worker memory when co-located on the same host machine. A directory, lets say /tmp/domain on the host, is mounted on the Alluxio worker container as well as the Alluxio client ( = Spark executor) container. The worker creates a domain socket /tmp/domain/d and if the client container mounts the same directory, it can write directly to the Alluxio worker w/o passing through network stack. The end result is faster data access when data is local.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing on a k8s v1.8 cluster. Unit tests added to `ExecutorPodFactorySuite`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-05T23:32:56Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T19:47:47Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T19:47:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bd81063df26c71498ca27522c21990be5a4cf9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d8858ae6b60fb7453eb501c54d8f3f1e6612880","head":{"label":"madanadit:k8s-volumes","ref":"k8s-volumes","sha":"3d8858ae6b60fb7453eb501c54d8f3f1e6612880","user":{"login":"madanadit","id":2262458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit","html_url":"https://github.com/madanadit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128255724,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjgyNTU3MjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"madanadit/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"madanadit","id":2262458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjI0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2262458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit","html_url":"https://github.com/madanadit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madanadit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/madanadit/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates the OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery rule to use filter expressions when listing partitions, if there are filter nodes in the logical plan. This avoids listing all partitions for large tables on the driver.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a minor bug where the partitions returned from fsRelation cannot be serialized without hitting a stack level too deep error. This is caused by serializing a stream to executors, where the stream is a recursive structure. If the stream is too long, the serialization stack reaches the maximum level of depth. The fix is to create a LocalRelation using an Array instead of the incoming Seq.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests for metadata-only queries.","created_at":"2018-04-05T23:31:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T04:11:08Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T04:11:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebdeadec110aa4dad00335df3ec3d08d660a48ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93cf2177da94a93b0db84a3d50ee5c806094bb43","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-23877-metadata-only-push-filters","ref":"SPARK-23877-metadata-only-push-filters","sha":"93cf2177da94a93b0db84a3d50ee5c806094bb43","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe don't have a good way to sequentially access `UnsafeArrayData` with a common interface such as `Seq`. An example is `MapObject` where we need to access several sequence collection types together. But `UnsafeArrayData` doesn't implement `ArrayData.array`. Calling `toArray` will copy the entire array. We can provide an `IndexedSeq` wrapper for `ArrayData`, so we can avoid copying the entire array.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-05T14:37:54Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:18Z","closed_at":"2018-04-17T13:13:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f8816b71f1201da0224d421acf2efba2db936ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b5de0f7d18af1d194305d7cd8c43ca007a5b980","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-23875","ref":"SPARK-23875","sha":"8b5de0f7d18af1d194305d7cd8c43ca007a5b980","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere was no check on nullability for arguments of `Tuple`s. This could lead to have weird behavior when a null value had to be deserialized into a non-nullable Scala object: in those cases, the `null` got silently transformed in a valid value (like `-1` for `Int`), corresponding to the default value we are using in the SQL codebase. This situation was very likely to happen when deserializing to a Tuple of primitive Scala types (like Double, Int, ...).\r\n\r\nThe PR adds the `AssertNotNull` to arguments of tuples which have been asked to be converted to non-nullable types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-21255, spark upstream adds support for creating encoders for java enum types, but the support is only added to Java API(for enum working within Java Beans). Since the java enum can come from third-party java library, we have use case that requires \r\n1. using java enum types as field of scala case class\r\n2. using java enum as the type T in Dataset[T]\r\n\r\nSpark ExpressionEncoder already supports ser/de many java types in ScalaReflection, so we propose to add support for java enum as well, as a follow up of SPARK-21255.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested the patch in our production cluster.  Added unit test.\r\nSince:\r\n1. it is not possible to define a java enum in scala directly, since the defined enum class in scala will miss method like valueOf which is added by java compiler\r\n2. it is not possible to define a test enum java class and use in scala test because the compilation of single scala test(-DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.DatasetSuite) won't compile the test java class first\r\n\r\nAs a result, I use the Spark SQL public java enum API(SaveMode.java) in the test. Please advise if there is a better way to test \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-04T04:59:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-19T05:54:13Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T00:07:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b9556e8aa78d18ac16474a4ece564261135ce8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90effb21375a2ec0e93426efcaae092ad3f59e26","head":{"label":"fangshil:SPARK-23862","ref":"SPARK-23862","sha":"90effb21375a2ec0e93426efcaae092ad3f59e26","user":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127070433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjcwNzA0MzM=","name":"spark","full_name":"fangshil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil/spark","description":"Mirror

backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20927 to branch-2.3\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the active spark session is set inconsistently (e.g., in createDataFrame, prior to query execution). Many places in spark also incorrectly query active session when they should be calling activeSession.getOrElse(defaultSession) and so might get None even if a Spark session exists.\r\n\r\nThe semantics here can be cleaned up if we also set the active session when the default session is set.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20926/files\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test, existing test. Note that if https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20926 merges first we should also update the tests there.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-04T00:30:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T07:37:02Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T19:36:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"559d31e1d092c618850a9228e2bd2ff87d40bcba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36fa1bdc847f0b5ffb61284a35f3183751255705","head":{"label":"ericl:backport-23809","ref":"backport-23809","sha":"36fa1bdc847f0b5ffb61284a35f3183751255705","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Removes the check for the keytab when we are running in mesos cluster mode.\r\n- Keeps the check for client mode since in cluster mode we eventually launch the driver within the cluster in client mode.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr proposed to split aggregation code into small functions in `HashAggregateExec`. In #18810, we got performance regression if JVMs didn't compile too long functions. I checked and I found the codegen of `HashAggregateExec` frequently goes over the limit when a query has too many aggregate functions (e.g., q66 in TPCDS).\r\n\r\nThe current master places all the generated aggregation code in a single function. In this pr, I modified the code to assign an individual function for each aggregate function (e.g., `SUM`\r\n and `AVG`). For example, in a query\r\n`SELECT SUM(a), AVG(a) FROM VALUES(1) t(a)`, the proposed code defines two functions\r\nfor `SUM(a)` and `AVG(a)` as follows;\r\n\r\n- generated  code with this pr

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSocket source in Structured streaming doesn't support recovering from checkpoint, but still the framework will pass the recovered offsets into this source, this will lead to unexpected error in socket source (because of wrong offsets, mentioned in JIRA).\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, adding a new option \"failonrecovery\". By default it is true, which means socket source will be failed when using recovered offsets. if it is set to false, then socket source will ignore unexpected offsets and keep processing data, which will potentially have some data loss issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT and verified in local cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-02T09:07:52Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T00:07:25Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T00:07:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d803d190fff2e39c7c1bd5032bac8dc79e1dc3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request tries to improve the error message for spark while reading parquet files with different schemas, e.g. One with a STRING column and the other with a INT column. A new ParquetSchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException is added to replace the old UnsupportedOperationException. The Exception is again wrapped in FileScanRdd.scala to throw a more a general QueryExecutionException with the actual parquet file name which trigger the exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests added to check the new exception and verify the error messages.\r\n\r\nAlso manually tested with two parquet with different schema to check the error message.\r\n\r\n<img

change introduces two optimizations to help speed up generation\r\nof listing data when parsing events logs.\r\n\r\nThe first one allows the parser to be stopped when enough data to\r\ncreate the listing entry has been read. This is currently the start\r\nevent plus environment info, to capture UI ACLs. If the end event is\r\nneeded, the code will skip to the end of the log to try to find that\r\ninformation, instead of parsing the whole log file.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this works better with uncompressed logs. Skipping bytes\r\non compressed logs only saves the work of parsing lines and some events,\r\nso not a lot of gains are observed.\r\n\r\nThe second optimization deals with in-progress logs. It works in two\r\nways: first, it completely avoids parsing the rest of the log for\r\nthese apps when enough listing data is read. This, unlike the above,\r\nalso speeds things up for compressed logs, since only the very beginning\r\nof the log has to be read.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the code that decides whether to re-parse logs to get\r\nupdated listing data will ignore in-progress applications until they've\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nBoth optimizations can be disabled but are enabled by default.\r\n\r\nI tested this on some fake event logs to see the effect. I created\r\n500 logs of about 60M each (so ~30G uncompressed; each log was 1.7M\r\nwhen compressed with zstd). Below, C = completed, IP = in-progress,\r\nthe size means the amount of data re-parsed at the end of logs\r\nwhen necessary.\r\n\r\n```\r\n            none/C   none/IP   zstd/C   zstd/IP\r\nOn / 16k      2s       2s       22s       2s\r\nOn / 1m       3s       2s       24s       2s\r\nOff          1.1m     1.1m      26s      24s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was with 4 threads on a single local SSD. As expected from the\r\nprevious explanations, there are considerable gains for in-progress\r\nlogs, and for uncompressed logs, but not so much when looking at the\r\nfull compressed log.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I removed the custom code to get the scan time by\r\ncreating a file on HDFS; since file mod times are not used to detect\r\nchanged logs anymore, local time is enough for the current use of\r\nthe SHS.","created_at":"2018-03-30T21:33:42Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T21:20:56Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T14:53:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05c86ccacd040f50626ff087cef2a78eead8b59a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a5563bec7f5f4063b1d32c0af653b13b54186c2","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-6951","ref":"SPARK-6951","sha":"3a5563bec7f5f4063b1d32c0af653b13b54186c2","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the requiredChildDistribution does not specify the partitions. This can cause the weird corner cases where the child's distribution is `SinglePartition` which satisfies the required distribution of `ClusterDistribution(no-num-partition-requirement)`, thus eliminating the shuffle needed to repartition input data into the required number of partitions (i.e. same as state stores). That can lead to \"file not found\" errors on the state store delta files as the micro-batch-with-no-shuffle will not run certain tasks and therefore not generate the expected state store delta files.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the required constraint on the number of partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified test harness to always check that ANY stateful operator should have a constraint on the number of partitions. As part of that, the existing opt-in checks on child output partitioning were removed, as they are redundant.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-29T23:25:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T23:52:03Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T23:52:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"525f8836ea6db4257d811f41f1222de62283168b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aeec84375b494d52f69c40bcf6d7df30947c8908","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-23827","ref":"SPARK-23827","sha":"aeec84375b494d52f69c40bcf6d7df30947c8908","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

new executor level memory metrics (JVM used heap/ off heap memory, on/off heap execution memory, on/off heap storage memory, direct pool memory, mapped pool memory), and expose via the executors REST API. This information will help provide insight into how executor and driver JVM memory is used, and for the different memory regions. It can be used to help determine good values for spark.executor.memory, spark.driver.memory, spark.memory.fraction, and spark.memory.storageFraction.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAn ExecutorMetrics class is added, with jvmUsedMemory, onHeapExecutionMemory, offHeapExecutionMemory, onHeapStorageMemory, and offHeapStorageMemory. The new ExecutorMetrics is sent by executors to the driver as part of Heartbeat. A heartbeat is added for the driver as well, to collect these metrics for the driver.\r\n\r\nThe EventLoggingListener tracks peak values for each metric for each stage and executor. On StageCompleted events, it will log a StageExecutorMetrics event, with the peak values for the executor metrics, for each executor which updated its metrics during the stage. Logging is done per executor per stage, to minimize the amount of additional logging. Configuration parameter spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorMetrics.enabled controls whether or not the new metrics are logged.\r\n\r\nThe AppStatusListener records the peak values for each memory metric.\r\n\r\nThe new memory metrics are added to the executors REST API.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests have been added. This was also tested on our cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-29T22:12:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T00:14:08Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T11:46:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00e3e3dca6526cdcf602a0f853a13054fe26977c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ae012654b81040cd65ea9b4b5f6d9bec7acd718","head":{"label":"edwinalu:SPARK-23429","ref":"SPARK-23429","sha":"8ae012654b81040cd65ea9b4b5f6d9bec7acd718","user":{"login":"edwinalu","id":26153035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTUzMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26153035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu","html_url":"https://github.com/edwinalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98354731,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODM1NDczMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"edwinalu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"edwinalu","id":26153035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTUzMDM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26153035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu","html_url":"https://github.com/edwinalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edwinalu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/edwinalu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose new option for JSON datasource which allows to specify encoding (charset) of input and output files. Here is an example of using of the option:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.read.schema(schema)\r\n  .option(\"multiline\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"encoding\", \"UTF-16LE\")\r\n  .json(fileName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the option is not specified, charset auto-detection mechanism is used by default.\r\n\r\nThe option can be used for saving datasets to jsons. Currently Spark is able to save datasets into json files in `UTF-8` charset only. The changes allow to save data in any supported charset. Here is the approximate list of supported charsets by Oracle Java SE: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html . An user can specify the charset of output jsons via the charset option like `.option(\"charset\", \"UTF-16BE\")`. By default the output charset is still `UTF-8` to keep backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe solution has the following restrictions for per-line mode (`multiline = false`):\r\n\r\n- If charset is different from UTF-8, the lineSep option must be specified. The option required because Hadoop LineReader cannot detect the line separator correctly. Here is the ticket for solving the issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23725\r\n\r\n- Encoding with [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) are not supported. For example, the `UTF-16` and `UTF-32` encodings are blacklisted. The problem can be solved by https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark-1/pull/2\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added the following tests:\r\n- reads an json file in `UTF-16LE` encoding with BOM

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark introduced new writer mode to overwrite only related partitions in SPARK-20236. While we are using this feature in our production cluster, we found a bug when writing multi-level partitions on HDFS.\r\n\r\nA simple test case to reproduce this issue:\r\nval df = Seq((\"1\",\"2\",\"3\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\",\"col3\")\r\ndf.write.partitionBy(\"col1\",\"col2\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/my/hdfs/location\")\r\n\r\nIf HDFS location \"/my/hdfs/location\" does not exist, there will be no output.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by the job commit change in SPARK-20236 in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol.\r\n\r\nIn the commit job process, the output has been written into staging dir /my/hdfs/location/.spark-staging.xxx/col1=1/col2=2, and then the code calls fs.rename to rename /my/hdfs/location/.spark-staging.xxx/col1=1/col2=2 to /my/hdfs/location/col1=1/col2=2. However, in our case the operation will fail on HDFS because /my/hdfs/location/col1=1 does not exists. HDFS rename can not create directory for more than one level. \r\n\r\nThis does not happen in the new unit test added with SPARK-20236 which uses local file system.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing a fix. When cleaning current partition dir /my/hdfs/location/col1=1/col2=2 before the rename op, if the delete op fails (because /my/hdfs/location/col1=1/col2=2 may not exist), we call mkdirs op to create the parent dir /my/hdfs/location/col1=1 (if the parent dir does not exist) so the following rename op can succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: in official HDFS document(https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/filesystem.html), the rename command has precondition \"dest must be root, or have a parent that exists\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe have tested this patch on our production cluster and it fixed the problem","created_at":"2018-03-29T05:20:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-13T05:49:44Z","closed_at":"2018-04-13T05:49:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cbf5732f85cbf472bc609c8b3d4495a40b5455c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08b9601ee9a0850f8fea0af7c9027bdef2016857","head":{"label":"fangshil:master","ref":"master","sha":"08b9601ee9a0850f8fea0af7c9027bdef2016857","user":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127070433,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjcwNzA0MzM=","name":"spark","full_name":"fangshil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangshil","id":2416746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTY3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2416746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil","html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangshil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangshil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the active spark session is set inconsistently (e.g., in createDataFrame, prior to query execution). Many places in spark also incorrectly query active session when they should be calling activeSession.getOrElse(defaultSession) and so might get None even if a Spark session exists.\r\n\r\nThe semantics here can be cleaned up if we also set the active session when the default session is set.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20926/files\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test, existing test. Note that if https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20926 merges first we should also update the tests there.","created_at":"2018-03-28T22:35:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T00:12:41Z","closed_at":"2018-04-04T00:12:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e69e1f12af9823c443209a07f8ad8481d5409c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/65146730d72ece95681682582cd2ade9f6ae5edc","head":{"label":"ericl:active-session-cleanup","ref":"active-session-cleanup","sha":"65146730d72ece95681682582cd2ade9f6ae5edc","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror
