KIP-590 requirement, we need to route the AlterConfig protocols toward the controller, instead of letting individual brokers handle them. \r\n\r\nIn this change, if the call is for validation only, we could still follow what we currently have by:\r\n1. Send topic resource changes to a random node\r\n2. Send broker resource changes to the specified node\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if this is not a validation only call (we are actually changing the config), all resources should be bundled and sent to the controller.\r\n\r\nBumped AlterConfig/IncrementalAlterConfig RPC to v2. When the 3 conditions are met:\r\n1. Request >= v2\r\n2. Not a validation request\r\n3. The target broker is not the controller\r\n\r\nwe would fail individual resource change request with `NOT_CONTROLLER` error.\r\n\r\nAlthough AlterConfig is deprecated, we still need to maintain the backward compatibility instead of leaving a possible RPC which could still be routing to non controller for actual config changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

some cases when a new log segment is rolled, the previous segment's\r\ntimeindex and offset index do not have the excess 0 bytes trimmed. This\r\nresults in a situation where the next load from disk triggers retention\r\nwindow breaches and the data is deleted. This happens because the mmap\r\npointing to the index data seeks to the end and because there are 0\r\nbytes padding the end in some cases, the loaded timestamp is 0.\r\n\r\nThe sanity checks were previously removed explicitly by KIP-263.\r\n\r\nA unittest was added to confirm the sanity check on timeindex will in fact catch this scenario. There doesn't seem to be existing testing for LogSegment.sanityCheck() so I opted to test the specific functionality and rely on the same logic that TransactionIndex currently relies on. \r\n\r\n###

PR implements the broker side changes of KIP-599, except the changes of the Rate implementation which will be addressed separately.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes/introduces the following:\r\n- It introduces the protocol changes.\r\n- It introduces a new quota manager `ControllerMutationQuotaManager` which is another specialization of the `ClientQuotaManager`.\r\n- It enforces the quota in the `KafkaApis` and in the `AdminManager`. This part handles new and old clients as described in the KIP.\r\n\r\nThe PR is a good shape. The tests coverage is good. I will add few more unit tests for the api layer later one.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

had to fix several compiler errors due to deprecation of auto application of `()`. A related\r\nXlint config (`-Xlint:nullary-override`) is no longer valid in 2.13, so we now only enable it\r\nfor 2.12. The compiler flagged two new inliner warnings that required suppression and\r\nthe semantics of `&` in `@nowarn` annotations changed, requiring a small change in\r\none of the warning suppressions.\r\n\r\nI also removed the deprecation of a number of methods in `KafkaZkClient` as\r\nthey should not have been deprecated in the first place since `KafkaZkClient` is an\r\ninternal class and we still use these methods in the Controller and so on. This\r\nbecame visible because the Scala compiler now respects Java's `@Deprecated`\r\nannotation.\r\n\r\nFinally, I included a few minor clean-ups (eg using `toBuffer` instead `toList`) when fixing\r\nthe compilation warnings.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy bug fixes in Scala 2.13.3:\r\n\r\n* Fix 2.13-only bug in Java collection converters that caused some operations to perform an extra pass\r\n* Fix 2.13.2 performance regression in Vector: restore special cases for small operands in appendedAll and prependedAll\r\n* Increase laziness of #:: for LazyList\r\n* Fixes related to annotation parsing of @Deprecated from Java sources in mixed compilation\r\n\r\nFull release notes:\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.3\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

`testBlockInConnectorStop` test is failing semi-frequently on Jenkins. It's difficult to verify the cause without complete logs and I'm unable to reproduce locally, but I suspect the cause may be that the Connect worker hasn't completed startup yet by the time the test begins and so the initial REST request to create a connector times out with a 500 error. This isn't an issue for normal tests but we artificially reduce the REST request timeout for these tests as some requests are meant to exhaust that timeout.\r\n\r\nThe changes here use a small hack to verify that the worker has started and is ready to handle all types of REST requests before tests start.\r\n\r\nIf possible, we might want to run Jenkins tests on this PR 5-10 times to see if the changes have any effect.\r\n\r\ncc @abbccdda \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

should address at least some of the excessive TaskCorruptedExceptions we've been seeing lately. Basically, at the moment we only commit tasks if `commitNeeded` is true -- this seems obvious by definition. But the problem is we do some essential cleanup in `postCommit` that should always be done before a task is closed:\r\n\r\n1. clear the PartitionGroup\r\n2. write the checkpoint\r\n\r\n2 is actually fine to skip when `commitNeeded = false` with ALOS, as we will have already written a checkpoint during the last commit. But for EOS, we _only_ write the checkpoint before a close -- so even if there is no new pending data since the last commit, we have to write the current offsets. If we don't, the task will be assumed dirty and we will run into our friend the TaskCorruptedException during (re)initialization.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should just always call `prepareCommit` and `postCommit` at the TaskManager level. Within the task, it can decide whether or not to actually do something in those methods based on `commitNeeded`. \r\n\r\nOne subtle issue is that we still need to avoid checkpointing a task that was still in CREATED, to avoid potentially overwriting an existing checkpoint with uninitialized empty offsets. Unfortunately we always suspend a task before closing and committing, so we lose the information about whether the task as in CREATED or RUNNING/RESTORING by the time we get to the checkpoint. For this we introduce a special flag to keep track of whether a suspended task should actually be checkpointed or not","created_at":"2020-06-25T01:37:13Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T22:13:16Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T22:11:56Z","merged_at":"2020-06-26T22:11:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"30df089631cf3c7667b609e2b9689cb02230c64e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4125b363105af8402294e40e2872a91fd5e3ab31","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:10166-excessive-TaskCorruptedException-test","ref":"10166-excessive-TaskCorruptedException-test","sha":"4125b363105af8402294e40e2872a91fd5e3ab31","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

very simply reduces the log level for these very frequently logged, very infrequently useful log messages to debug level.\r\nMy experience operating these connectors is that these logs make reading info level logs quite cluttered. The MDC context certainly helps filter, but I think debug is more appropriate here -- if the log level were debug and someone wanted to promote it to info, that certainly would be an odd desire!\r\n\r\nDebug is recommended here over Trace, since these do not really help trace specific messages or paths, and give kind of general debug information at a regular cadence (volume of these log messages does not grow with throughput).

general lifecycle for a sink task is:\r\n\r\n1. Instantiate the `SinkTask` object\r\n2. Invoke `SinkTask::initialize`\r\n3. Invoke `SinkTask::start`\r\n4. While the task is still running:\r\n- Poll Kafka for records\r\n- Give those records to the task via `SinkTask::put`\r\n- Periodically commit offsets, which involves calling `SinkTask::preCommit` and committing the resulting map of `TopicPartition` to offset to Kafka\r\n5. Commit offsets a penultimate time (including the call to `SinkTask::preCommit)\r\n6. Invoke `SinkTask::stop`\r\n7. Close the consumer for the task\r\n8. Commit offsets a final time (also including the call to `SinkTask::preCommit`)\r\n\r\nThis final offset commit happens indirectly: closing the consumer for a sink task causes the rebalance listener for that consumer to be triggered, and the rebalance listener the framework uses for its consumers performs an offset commit for the task when partitions are revoked.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a problem because the framework calls `SinkTask::stop` before closing the consumer for the task. It's possible and even likely that tasks will have de-allocated resources necessary for their `preCommit` method and will fail unexpectedly at this point.\r\n\r\nSince the framework already [ensures that offsets are committed](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/199f375b546c201289d2b15084e0a95598093fe0/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerSinkTask.java#L194-L196) after the last call to `SinkTask::put`, it should be fine to remove this extra offset commit. There is still a chance that some data may be dropped in the case that a task performs completely asynchronous writes to Kafka and has written data between the pre-stop call to `SinkTask::preCommit` and the post-stop one, but there will be no loss of delivery guarantees provided by the framework, and this change will adhere to the publicly-stated API for sink tasks.\r\n\r\nA unit test is added

there's any pending data and we haven't flushed the producer when we abort a transaction, a KafkaException is returned for the previous `send`. This is a bit misleading, since the situation is not an unrecoverable error and so the Kafka Exception is really non-fatal. For now, we should just catch and swallow this in the RecordCollector (see also: [KAFKA-10169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10186))\r\n\r\nThe reason we ended up aborting an un-flushed transaction was due to the combination of\r\na. always aborting the ongoing transaction when any task is closed/revoked\r\nb. only committing (and flushing) if at least one of the revoked tasks needs to be committed (regardless of whether any non-revoked tasks have data/transaction in flight)\r\n\r\nGiven the above, we can end up with an ongoing transaction that isn't committed since none of the revoked tasks have any data in the transaction. We then abort the transaction anyway, when those tasks are closed. So in addition to the above (swallowing this exception), we should avoid unnecessarily aborting data for tasks that haven't been revoked.\r\n\r\nWe can handle this by splitting the RecordCollector's `close` into a dirty and clean flavor: if dirty, we need to abort the transaction since it may be dirty due to the commit attempt failing. But if clean, we can skip aborting the transaction since we know that either we just committed and thus there is no ongoing transaction to abort, or else the transaction in flight contains no data

test `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTest.testReplication` failed too often recently. It failed at least 6 times (I didn't check all failed builds) in today's(6/17) trunk build, and also failed my PR testing! I think it should be fixed soon to save developer's time. \r\n\r\nThe test is to test MM2 replication. And recently, it failed all because the Records were not replicated to primary/backup cluster yet, so that the consumer cannot retrieve the records in time.  In this PR, I add retries to these consumer.poll, to have 3 retries to poll the records. It should make the tests more stable.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the assertion error message didn't display successfully because the `consume()` will throw exception directly and got displayed. After my change, the assertion error message can be displayed, and will let us know exactly which assertion failed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

commit 492306a updated both jetty to version 9.4.27.v20200227 and jersey to version 2.31\r\n\r\nHowever in the latest versions of jetty, the renaming of the method `Response#closeOutput` to `Response#completeOutput` has been reverted, with the latest version using again `Response#closeOutput`. \r\n\r\nJersey has not released a recent version in which `Response#closeOutput` is called directly. In its latest version 2.31 `Response#closeOutput` will be called if `Response#completeOutput` throws a `NoSuchMethodError` exception, which keeps things functional but inefficient. \r\n\r\nTherefore we can choose to merge this PR early, while waiting for a new version of jersey, or we could wait and update both dependencies together again. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

KIP-455, we changed the behavior of the reassignment tool so that the `--additional` flag is required in order to use the command to alter the throttle. This patch improves the documentation to make this clearer and adds some integration tests to validate the behavior.\r\n\r\nThis patch also contains a few minor code quality improvements:\r\n\r\n- Factor out a helper `calculateCurrentMoveMap` from `calculateMoveMap` to compute the current move map, which makes the logic easier to follow\r\n- Rename `calculateMoveMap` to `calculateProposedMoveMap` to make intention clearer\r\n- Split `modifyBrokerThrottles` into two methods `modifyLogDirThrottle` and `modifyInterBrokerThrottle`\r\n- Move logic to compute leader and follower throttles into a new method `modifyReassignmentThrottle`, which takes it out of the execution path when log dir throttles are changed\r\n- Minor stylistic improvements such as replacing `.map.flatten` with `.flatMap`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the test from #8886 to `trunk` -- this should be merged to `2.6` branch.\r\n\r\nOne open question. In `2.6` and `trunk` we rely on the active tasks to wipe out the store if it crashes. However, assume there is a hard JVM crash and we don't call `closeDirty()` the store would not be wiped out. Thus, I am wondering, if we would need to fix this (for both active and standby tasks) and do a check on _startup_ if a local store must be wiped out?\r\n\r\nThe current test passes, as we do a proper cleanup after the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nCall for review @guozhangwang @abbccdda

instance should process key 1 and crash\r\n - after fail-over to instance 2, the store should only contain key 0\r\n - instance 2 should reprocess key 1 (we skip it to avoid the crash for this case; note that the store content in not modified; we only need to do this to make sure instance 1 can be restarted and rebuild the standby store)\r\n - instance 1 is restarted and rebuild the standby

flaky test exists for a long time, and it happened more frequently recently. (also happened in my PR testing!! :(  ) In KAFKA-8264 and KAFKA-8460, it described the issue for this test is that \r\n> Timed out before consuming expected 2700 records. The number consumed was xxxx\r\n\r\nI did some investigation. This test is to test: \r\n> we consume all partitions if fetch max bytes and max.partition.fetch.bytes are low. \r\n\r\nAnd what it did, is to create 3 topics and 30 partitions for each. And then, iterate through all 90 partitions to send 30 records for each. Finally, verify the we can consume all the records successfully. \r\n\r\nWhat the error message saying is that it cannot consume all the records in time (might be the busy system) So, we can actually decrease the record size to avoid it. I checked all the error messages we collected in KAFKA-8264 and KAFKA-8460, the failed cases can always consume at least 1440 up (total is 2700). So, I set the records half size of the original setting, it'll become 1350 records in total. It should make this test more stable.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [

the level of logging on not being unable to process the fetch request to trace level.`\r\n\r\nMake the unknown fetch session message trace level to not cause confusion. There exists a fixed number of fetch sessions every broker could have.  The default is 1000.  If the cache is full and none can be evicted, then the server falls back to the consumer sending the entire subscription each time it fetches messages.\r\n\r\nThe items in the cache can be evicted after x number of sec. If the existing session is evicted, the server will send unknown fetch session error. Then the client will make a full fetch request with the subscription, trying to set up a new session. Always having to bother client, warning about this makes users mistakenly think there is a problem when there is none.\r\n\r\n`Signed-off-by: Andrew Choi <li_andchoi@microsoft.com>`\r\n\r\n###

PR fixes the cause of failing tests mentioned in the jira:\r\n - `kafka.network.DynamicConnectionQuotaTest`\r\n - `kafka.api.CustomQuotaCallbackTest`\r\n - `kafka.server.DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest`\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\nThe call to `ChangeNotificationProcessorThread.queue.take()` could throw an `InterruptedException`.  While the queue is empty and the thread is blocking on taking an item from the queue, a concurrent call to `FinalizedFeatureChangeListener.close()` could interrupt the thread and cause an `InterruptedException` to be raised from `queue.take()`. In such a case, it is safe to ignore the exception since the thread is being shutdown.\r\nDefinitely ignoring the `InterruptedException` for the above reason was the intent of the code that used the `ignoring` clause for the same. But it seems unfortunately the `ignoring` clause does not ignore `InterruptedException`, so that doesn't work for us. To confirm this theory, I found the following code in `scala.util.control.Exception.scala`: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.0/src/library/scala/util/control/Exception.scala#L167-L176.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nThe fix in this PR is to just not use the `ignoring` clause. We rely on existing mechanism in `ShutdownableThread` that ignores the exception during shutdown.\r\n\r\n**Test plan:**\r\nRan the unit and integration tests and found that the test failures are gone now.\r\nI will wait for CI to pass before merging this

the responsibility for recording task and connector startup and failure metrics from the Worker class  into the status listener that gets passed into the WorkerTask. The status listener is decorated to record the metrics when onStartup or onFailure occur (if failure happens before startup).\r\nThis gets around the previous issues where these metrics were not being recorded because \r\nthe WorkerTasks/WorkerConnectors were either not propagating exceptions upwards, or were unable to do so easily because they were running on completely different threads.\r\nAlso split out WorkerMetricsGroup from being an inner class into being a standard class. This was to make sure the Data Abstraction Coupling checkStyle rule for the Worker class was not violated.\r\n\r\nTesting involved adding some unit tests for the decorated listeners to ensure they recorded metrics correctly. Some manual testing was done with Connectors and Tasks that deliberately threw exceptions in the startup phase to ensure JMX metrics were reported correctly.\r\nSome of the unit tests for the Worker
