Its lifetime is the lifetime of the session that created it.  But now cache data is cross-session. Its lifetime is the lifetime of the Spark application. That's will cause the memory leak if cache a local temporary view in memory when the session closed.\r\nIn this PR, we uncache the cached data of local temporary view when session closed. This PR doesn't impact the cached data of global temp view and persisted view.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. create a local temporary view v1\r\n2. cache it in memory\r\n3. close session without drop table v1.\r\n\r\nThe application will hold the memory forever. In a long running thrift server scenario. It's worse.\r\n```shell\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> CACHE TABLE testCacheTable AS SELECT 1;\r\nCACHE TABLE testCacheTable AS SELECT 1;\r\n+---------+--+\r\n| Result

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ncast to smallint behaviour in SparkSQL is made consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is set to PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL behaviour is very different when casting to smallint.\r\nFor e.g:\r\nselect cast('abc' to smallint) in SparkSQL gives null.\r\nselect cast('abc' to smallint) in PostgreSQL gives \"invalid input syntax for integer: abc\"\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe minimum runtime to speculation used to be a fixed value 100ms.  It means tasks finished in seconds will also be speculated and more executors will be required.\r\nTo improve this situation, we add `spark.speculation.minRuntime` to control the minimum runtime limit of speculation.\r\nWe can reduce normal tasks to be speculated by adjusting `spark.speculation.minRuntime`.\r\n\r\n_**Example:**_\r\nTasks that don't need to be speculated:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25916266/68921759-b62afe00-07b4-11ea-8786-d50ef0d20ea0.png)\r\nand\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25916266/68921795-d3f86300-07b4-11ea-8ebf-27cf2a0fa493.png)\r\n\r\nTasks are more likely to go wrong and need to be speculated:\r\n(especially those shuffle tasks with large amount of data and will cost minutes even hours)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25916266/68921934-39e4ea80-07b5-11ea-84b2-6e115c3960b0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve speculation performance by reducing speculated tasks which don't need to be speculated actually.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd ShowTableStatement and make SHOW TABLE EXTENDED go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have this methods in the catalog to implement an V2 command\r\n\r\n- catalog.getPartition\r\n- catalog.getTempViewOrPermanentTableMetadata\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nSHOW TABLE EXTENDED FROM LIKE 't' // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When running SHOW TABLE EXTENDED Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show Python, pandas and PyArrow versions in integrated UDF tests as a clue so when the test cases fail, it show the related

combinations of Python, Pandas and PyArrow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make debug easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt will change test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe types decimal and numeric are equivalent. Both types are part of the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe real type is  4 bytes, variable-precision, inexact, 6 decimal digits precision, same as our float, part of the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nimprove sql standard support\r\nother dbs\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/datatype-numeric.html\r\nhttps://prestodb.io/docs/current/language/types.html#floating-point\r\nhttp://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-data-types/\r\nMySQL treats REAL as a synonym for DOUBLE PRECISION (a nonstandard variation), unless the REAL_AS_FLOAT SQL mode is enabled.\r\nIn MySQL, NUMERIC is implemented as DECIMAL, so the following remarks about DECIMAL apply equally to NUMERIC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthe type `real` and `numeric` become valid , which are aliases for `float` and `decmial`\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-27444 introduced `dmlStatementNoWith` so that any dml that needs cte support can leverage it. It be better if we move DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE rules to `dmlStatementNoWith`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWit this change, we can support syntax like \"With t AS (SELECT) DELETE FROM xxx\", and so as UPDATE/MERGE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew cases added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-15T03:38:22Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T04:57:11Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T03:49:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f8f3cdac1e3673f4849d136c650fbd29c31e714","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ea9e3998e69fc3361e6af3102a067b7ea3f506a","head":{"label":"xianyinxin:SPARK-29907","ref":"SPARK-29907","sha":"8ea9e3998e69fc3361e6af3102a067b7ea3f506a","user":{"login":"xianyinxin","id":15028683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182274989,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODIyNzQ5ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"xianyinxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xianyinxin","id":15028683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin/spark","description":"Apache

issue mainly shows up when you enable dynamic allocation:\r\nbecause there are many executor state changes (because of executors\r\nbeing requested and starting to run, and later stopped), the lifecycle\r\nmanager class could end up logging information about the same executor\r\nmultiple times, since the different events would cause the same\r\nexecutor update to be present in multiple pod snapshots. On top of that,\r\nit could end up making multiple redundant calls into the API server\r\nfor the same pod.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was when the config was set to not delete executor\r\npods; with dynamic allocation, that means pods keep accumulating\r\nin the API server, and every time the full sync is done by the\r\npolling source, all executors, even the finished ones that Spark\r\ntechnically does not care about anymore, would be processed.\r\n\r\nThe change modifies the lifecycle monitor so that it:\r\n\r\n- logs executor updates a single time, even if it shows up in\r\n  multiple snapshots, by checking whether the state change\r\n  happened before.\r\n- marks finished-but-not-deleted-in-k8s executors with a label\r\n  so that they can be easily filtered out.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the amount of logging done by the lifecycle manager,\r\nwhich is a minor thing in general since the logs are at debug level.\r\nBut it also reduces the amount of data that needs to be fetched\r\nfrom the API server under certain configurations, and overall\r\nreduces interaction with the API server when dynamic allocation is on.\r\n\r\nThere's also a change in the snapshot store to ensure that the\r\nsame subscriber is not called concurrently. That is kind of a bug,\r\nsince it means subscribers could be processing snapshots out of order,\r\nor even that they could block multiple threads (e.g. the allocator\r\ncallback was synchronized). I actually ran into the \"concurrent calls\"\r\nsituation in the lifecycle manager during testing, and while it did not\r\nseem to cause problems, it did make for some head scratching while\r\nlooking at the logs. It seemed safer to fix that.\r\n\r\nUnit tests were updated to check for the changes. Also tested in real\r\ncluster with dynamic allocation on.","created_at":"2019-11-15T02:11:05Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T21:15:28Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T21:15:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4c572f224751da7888ef57c920b71cfc360f658","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08e8d8267e78979b4637368cca27a0be1e9f08df","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-29905","ref":"SPARK-29905","sha":"08e8d8267e78979b4637368cca27a0be1e9f08df","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a property `spark.fsUrlStreamHandlerFactory.enabled` to allow users turn off the default registration of `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FsUrlStreamHandlerFactory`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis [SPARK-25694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25694) is a long-standing issue. Originally, [[SPARK-12868][SQL] Allow adding jars from hdfs](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17342 ) added this for better Hive support. However, this have a side-effect when the users use Apache Spark without `-Phive`. This causes exceptions when the users tries to use another custom factories or 3rd party library (trying to set this). This configuration will unblock those non-hive users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This provides a new user-configurable property.\r\nBy default, the behavior is unchanged.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

Param._copyValues to check valid Param objects supplied as extra\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEstimator.fit() and Model.transform() accept a dictionary of extra parameters whose values are used to overwrite those supplied at initialization or by default.  Additionally, the ParamGridBuilder.addGrid accepts a parameter and list of values. The keys are presumed to be valid Param objects. This change adds a check that only Param objects are supplied as keys.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nParam objects are created by and bound to an instance of Params (Estimator, Model, or Transformer). They may be obtained from their parent as attributes, or by name through getParam.\r\n\r\nThe documentation does not state that keys must be valid Param objects, nor describe how one may be obtained. The current behavior is to silently ignore keys which are not valid Param objects.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIf the user does not pass in a Param object as required for keys in `extra` for Estimator.fit() and Model.transform(), and `param` for ParamGridBuilder.addGrid, an error will be raised indicating it is an invalid object. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded method test_copy_param_extras_check to test_param.py.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ncast to float behaviour in SparkSQL is made consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is set to PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL behaviour is very different when casting to float.\r\nFor e.g:\r\nselect cast('abc' to float) in SparkSQL gives null.\r\nselect cast('abc' to float) in PostgreSQL gives  \"invalid input syntax for type double precision\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested. Test cases will be added soon.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-27990 (#24830) provide a way to recursively load data from datasource. In SQL, when query a hive table, this property passed by the `relation.tableMeta.properties`. But it is filtered out now. So we can not lookup file recursively for a Hive table.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I don't add a new property or feature. The property `recursiveFileLookup` in TBLPROPERTIES should work in current implementation. But it's filtered out bugly.\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE test1 (id bigint)\r\nSTORED AS PARQUET LOCATION '$baseDir'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES (\r\n'recursiveFileLookup'='true')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtends options for the Spark Avro formatter allowing to use custom Avro logical types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAt the moment only timestamp and decimal logical types are supported at Spark but Avro support any conversion that you could need. This change keep the default mappings and allow to add news.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark\r\n    .read\r\n    .format(\"avro\")\r\n    .option(\"logicalTypeMapper\", \"org.example.CustomAvroLogicalCatalystMapper\")\r\n    .load()     \r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly you need is register your custom Avro logical type and then implement `AvroLogicalTypeCatalystMapper`\r\n\r\n#### Example of mapper implementation: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nobject ISODatetimeLogicalType extends LogicalType(\"datetime\") {\r\n  def register(): Unit = LogicalTypes.register(getName, new LogicalTypes.LogicalTypeFactory() {\r\n    override def fromSchema(schema: Schema): LogicalType = ISODatetimeLogicalType.this\r\n  })\r\n  override def validate(schema: Schema): Unit = {\r\n    if (schema.getType ne Schema.Type.STRING) {\r\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\r\n        \"Datetime (iso8601) can only be used with an underlying string type\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass CustomAvroLogicalCatalystMapper extends AvroLogicalTypeCatalystMapper {\r\n  override def toSqlType: PartialFunction[LogicalType, SchemaConverters.SchemaType] = {\r\n    case ISODatetimeLogicalType => SchemaType(TimestampType, nullable = false)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  override def toAvroSchema: PartialFunction[RecordInfo, Schema] = {\r\n    case RecordInfo(TimestampType, _, _) =>\r\n      ISODatetimeLogicalType.addToSchema(SchemaBuilder.builder().stringType())\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  override def deserialize\r\n  : PartialFunction[LogicalType, DataDeserializer => Unit] = {\r\n    case ISODatetimeLogicalType =>\r\n      dataUpdater =>\r\n        val datetime = dataUpdater.value match {\r\n          case s: String => UTF8String.fromString(s)\r\n          case s: Utf8 => val bytes = new Array[Byte](s.getByteLength)\r\n            System.arraycopy(s.getBytes, 0, bytes, 0, s.getByteLength)\r\n            UTF8String.fromBytes(bytes)\r\n        }\r\n        val timestamp = Timestamp.from(\r\n          OffsetDateTime.parse(datetime.toString)\r\n            .atZoneSameInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC)\r\n            .toInstant\r\n        )\r\n        dataUpdater.updater\r\n          .setLong(dataUpdater.ordinal, timestamp.toInstant.toEpochMilli * 1000L)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  override def serialize: PartialFunction[LogicalType, DataSerializer => Any] = {\r\n    case ISODatetimeLogicalType =>\r\n      dataSerializer =>\r\n        val datetime = OffsetDateTime.ofInstant(\r\n          Instant.ofEpochMilli(dataSerializer\r\n            .getter\r\n            .getLong(dataSerializer.ordinal) / 1000),\r\n          ZoneOffset.UTC\r\n        ).toString\r\n\r\n        Try(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME.parse(datetime))\r\n          .map(_ => datetime)\r\n          .getOrElse(throw new IncompatibleSchemaException(\r\n            s\"Cannot Serialize to Avro logical type ISO8601Datetime: \" +\r\n              s\"'$datetime' is not a valid datetime.\"))\r\n\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, at the moment of use the Spark Avro formatter and `to_avro` & `from_avro` functions. now you can pass the class name of the logical types mapper as an optional parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- AvroSuit: struct <=> schema types conversions test.\r\n- AvroLogicalTypeSuit: Avro formatter test.","created_at":"2019-11-14T14:07:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T00:14:10Z","closed_at":"2020-03-14T00:14:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a781773c644403f659da0b1dd8480bca271395b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc5352243de47c664631333300579174d5fd75d0","head":{"label":"Telefonica:feat/support-cunstom-avro-logical-types-mappings","ref":"feat/support-cunstom-avro-logical-types-mappings","sha":"cc5352243de47c664631333300579174d5fd75d0","user":{"login":"Telefonica","id":1536176,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE1MzYxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica","html_url":"https://github.com/Telefonica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165840641,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU4NDA2NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"Telefonica/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Telefonica","id":1536176,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE1MzYxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica","html_url":"https://github.com/Telefonica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Telefonica/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Telefonica/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd an optional parameter to the staticPageRank computation with the result of a previous PageRank computation. This would make the algorithm start from a different starting point closer to the convergence configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29877\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to have the possibility, when computing staticPageRank to use a previous computation as a checkpoint to continue the iterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows to start the static  page Rank computation from the point where an earlier one finished.\r\n\r\nExample: Compute 10 iteration first, and continue for 3 more iterations\r\n```scala\r\nval partialPageRank = graph.ops.staticPageRank(numIter=10, resetProb=0.15)\r\nval continuationPageRank = graph.ops.staticPageRank(numIter=3,  resetProb=0.15, Some(partialPageRank))\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nYes, some tests were added.\r\nTesting was done as follow:\r\n- Check how many iterations it takes for a static Page Rank computation to converge\r\n- Run the static Page Rank computation for half of these iterations and take result as checkpoint\r\n- Restart computation and check that number of iterations it takes to converge. It never has to be larger than the original one and in most of the cases it is much smaller.\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of sinks and the normalization done in [[SPARK-18847]] it is not exactly equivalent to compute static page rank for 2 iterations, take the result at checkpoint and run for 2 more iterations than to compute directly for 4 iterations.\r\n\r\nHowever this checkpointing can give the algorithm a hint about the true distribution of pageRanks in the graph\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-14T13:53:39Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T08:37:34Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T08:25:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ae31bf92ebac9a5cd5e208c084e84ed7b80b2f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/830f6ed4760fc903dff32e7d2041e9bebc60c969","head":{"label":"JoanFM:pageRank_checkPoint","ref":"pageRank_checkPoint","sha":"830f6ed4760fc903dff32e7d2041e9bebc60c969","user":{"login":"JoanFM","id":19825685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODI1Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19825685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM","html_url":"https://github.com/JoanFM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":221264742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjEyNjQ3NDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"JoanFM/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoanFM","id":19825685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODI1Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19825685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM","html_url":"https://github.com/JoanFM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoanFM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoanFM/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo make SparkSQL's `cast as double` behavior consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL have a lot different cast behavior between types by default. We should make SparkSQL's cast behavior be consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. If user switches to PostgreSQL dialect now, they will\r\n\r\n- get an AnalysisException when they input any data type is booleanType, StringType or DateType.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-14T13:43:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-15T02:31:49Z","closed_at":"2019-12-15T02:31:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"381347bb8442ab60ff3cd3a7fdee0e667eabf217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e46418e15af58171a5302f506789ae1bb348422","head":{"label":"amanomer:29842","ref":"29842","sha":"0e46418e15af58171a5302f506789ae1bb348422","user":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203616393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM2MTYzOTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"amanomer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to switch `pygments.rb`, which only support Python 2 and seems inactive for the last few years (https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb), to Rouge which is pure Ruby code highlighter that is compatible with Pygments.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be pretty difficult to change but thankfully Rouge does a great job as the alternative.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe're moving to Python 3 and drop Python 2 completely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nMaybe a little bit of different syntax style but should not have a notable change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested the build and checked the documentation.","created_at":"2019-11-14T13:06:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:39Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T04:44:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba4de8d8ae6e1adc7bdc13584ecf5cd37b32bf18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b142b3d6c122e5f96b3b4ac34a17db7a514050c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28752","ref":"SPARK-28752","sha":"2b142b3d6c122e5f96b3b4ac34a17db7a514050c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Web UI SQL Tab provides information on the executed SQL using plan graphs and by reporting SQL execution plans. Both sources provide useful information. Physical execution plans report Codegen Stage Ids. This PR adds Codegen Stage Ids to the plan graphs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is useful to have Codegen Stage Id information also reported in plan graphs, this allows to more easily match physical plans and graphs with metrics when troubleshooting SQL execution.\r\nExample snippet to show the proposed change:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ncast to decimal behaviour in SparkSQL is made consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is set to PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL behaviour is very different when casting to decimal.\r\nFor e.g: \r\nselect cast('abc' to decimal) in SparkSQL gives null.\r\nselect cast('abc' to decimal) in PostgreSQL gives \"invalid input syntax for type numeric\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested. Test cases will be added soon \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-14T11:15:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T11:46:31Z","closed_at":"2019-12-15T02:32:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97436fa829818c3446ee5cf819f34a168f317f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f9f12dd155beac956fbf0fffd3eb261c581ae218","head":{"label":"iRakson:decimalPostgreSQL","ref":"decimalPostgreSQL","sha":"f9f12dd155beac956fbf0fffd3eb261c581ae218","user":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205127207,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUxMjcyMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"iRakson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23977 I made a mistake related to this line: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3725b1324f731d57dc776c256bc1a100ec9e6cd0#diff-71c2cad03f08cb5f6c70462aa4e28d3aL112\r\n\r\nPreviously,\r\n \r\n1. the reader iterator for R worker read some initial data eagerly during RDD materialization. So it read the data before actual execution. For some reasons, in this case, it showed standard error from R worker.\r\n\r\n2. After that, when error happens during actual execution, stderr wasn't shown: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3725b1324f731d57dc776c256bc1a100ec9e6cd0#diff-71c2cad03f08cb5f6c70462aa4e28d3aL260\r\n\r\nAfter my change https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3725b1324f731d57dc776c256bc1a100ec9e6cd0#diff-71c2cad03f08cb5f6c70462aa4e28d3aL112, it now ignores 1. case and only does 2. of previous code path, because 1. does not happen anymore as I avoided to such eager execution (which is consistent with PySpark code path).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to do only 1.  before/after execution always because It is pretty much possible R worker was failed during actual execution and it's best to show the stderr from R worker whenever possible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt currently swallows standard error from R worker which makes debugging harder.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n\r\n```R\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(list(list(n=1)))\r\ncollect(dapply(df,

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `as` API to RelationalGroupedDataset. It creates KeyValueGroupedDataset instance using given grouping expressions, instead of a typed function in groupByKey API. Because it can leverage existing columns, it can use existing data partition, if any, when doing operations like cogroup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently if users want to do cogroup on DataFrames, there is no good way to do except for KeyValueGroupedDataset.\r\n\r\n1. KeyValueGroupedDataset ignores existing data partition if any. That is a problem.\r\n2. groupByKey calls typed function to create additional keys. You can not reuse existing columns, if you just need grouping by them.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// df1 and df2 are certainly partitioned and sorted.\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\r\n  .repartition($\"a\").sortWithinPartitions(\"a\")\r\nval df2 = Seq((1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 5)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\r\n  .repartition($\"a\").sortWithinPartitions(\"a\")\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\n// This groupBy.as.cogroup won't unnecessarily repartition the data \r\nval df3 = df1.groupBy(\"a\").as[Int]\r\n  .cogroup(df2.groupBy(\"a\").as[Int]) { case (key, data1, data2) =>\r\n    data1.zip(data2).map { p =>\r\n      p._1.getInt(2) + p._2.getInt(2)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(5) SerializeFromObject [input[0, int, false] AS value#11247]\r\n+- CoGroup org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameSuite$$Lambda$4922/1206709281@6eec1b6f, a#11209: int, createexternalrow(a#11209, b#11210, c#11211, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), createexternalrow(a#11225, b#11226, c#11227, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), [a#11209], [a#11225], [a#11209, b#11210, c#11211], [a#11225, b#11226, c#11227], obj#11246: int\r\n   :- *(2) Sort [a#11209 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#11209, 5), false, [id=#10218]\r\n   :     +- *(1) Project [_1#11202 AS a#11209, _2#11203 AS b#11210, _3#11204 AS c#11211]\r\n   :        +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#11202, _2#11203, _3#11204]\r\n   +- *(4) Sort [a#11225 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#11225, 5), false, [id=#10223]\r\n         +- *(3) Project [_1#11218 AS a#11225, _2#11219 AS b#11226, _3#11220 AS c#11227]\r\n            +- *(3) LocalTableScan [_1#11218, _2#11219, _3#11220]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Current approach creates additional AppendColumns and repartition data again\r\nval df4 = df1.groupByKey(r => r.getInt(0)).cogroup(df2.groupByKey(r => r.getInt(0))) {\r\n  case (key, data1, data2) =>\r\n    data1.zip(data2).map { p =>\r\n      p._1.getInt(2) + p._2.getInt(2)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(7) SerializeFromObject [input[0, int, false] AS value#11257]\r\n+- CoGroup org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameSuite$$Lambda$4933/1381027007@37171997, value#11252: int, createexternalrow(a#11209, b#11210, c#11211, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), createexternalrow(a#11225, b#11226, c#11227, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), [value#11252], [value#11254], [a#11209, b#11210, c#11211], [a#11225, b#11226, c#11227], obj#11256: int\r\n   :- *(3) Sort [value#11252 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(value#11252, 5), true, [id=#10302]\r\n   :     +- AppendColumns org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameSuite$$Lambda$4930/1952919534@7ce07f47, createexternalrow(a#11209, b#11210, c#11211, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), [input[0, int, false] AS value#11252]\r\n   :        +- *(2) Sort [a#11209 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :           +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#11209, 5), false, [id=#10297]\r\n   :              +- *(1) Project [_1#11202 AS a#11209, _2#11203 AS b#11210, _3#11204 AS c#11211]\r\n   :                 +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#11202, _2#11203, _3#11204]\r\n   +- *(6) Sort [value#11254 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(value#11254, 5), true, [id=#10312]\r\n         +- AppendColumns org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameSuite$$Lambda$4932/1526528849@1f0e0c1f, createexternalrow(a#11225, b#11226, c#11227, StructField(a,IntegerType,false), StructField(b,IntegerType,false), StructField(c,IntegerType,false)), [input[0, int, false] AS value#11254]\r\n            +- *(5) Sort [a#11225 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n               +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#11225, 5), false, [id=#10307]\r\n                  +- *(4) Project [_1#11218 AS a#11225, _2#11219 AS b#11226, _3#11220 AS c#11227]\r\n                     +- *(4) LocalTableScan [_1#11218, _2#11219, _3#11220]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this adds a new `as` API to RelationalGroupedDataset.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose parsing timestamp strings up to microsecond precision. To achieve that, I added a sub-class of `GregorianCalendar` to get access to `protected` field `fields` which contains non-normalized parsed fields immediately after parsing. In particular, I assume that the `MILLISECOND` field contains entire seconds fraction converted to `int`. By knowing the expected digits in the fractional part, the parsed field is converted to a fraction up to the microsecond precision.\r\n\r\nThis PR supports additional patterns for seconds fractions from `S` to `SSSSSS` in JSON/CSV options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with JSON and CSV datasources, and to allow parsing timestamp strings up to microsecond precision.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, the PR extends the set of supported timestamp patterns for the seconds fraction by `S`, `SS`, `SSSS`, `SSSSS`, and `SSSSSS`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `JsonExpressionSuite`, `JsonFunctionsSuite`, `JsonSuite`, `CsvSuite`, `UnivocityParserSuite`, and added new tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `JsonFunctionsSuite` for `from_json()` and to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR allows a user to specify custom [k8s tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) when running Spark on kubernetes for both driver and executor pods.\r\n\r\nThe user can now set the **key**, **effect**, **operator** and **value** properties when running spark-submit, as long as they're prefixed by:\r\n\r\n`spark.kubernetes.driver.tolerations.n` or `spark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.n`\r\n\r\nwhere n = a number starting from 0 that is incremented of 1.\r\n\r\n#### Why not using the key field, as per original design doc attached to the JIRA issue?\r\n\r\nAs per [kubernetes toleration v1 spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#toleration-v1-core), the field key can be unset, thus disqualifying it as a unique identifier.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# driver pods tolerate the taint group:spark-driver registered to a specialised worker group\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.tolerations.0.key group\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.tolerations.0.operator Equal\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.tolerations.0.effect NoSchedule\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.tolerations.0.value spark-driver\r\n\r\n# executor pods tolerate the taint group:spark-executor registered to another specialised worker group\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.0.key group\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.0.operator Equal\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.0.effect NoSchedule\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.0.value spark-executor\r\n\r\n# driver pods tolerate when the key spot exists\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.1.key spot\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.tolerations.1.operator Exists\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark already supports using [node selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector), which is helpful to pin driver/executor pods to a specific worker group. However, without tainting the workers and setting at least one toleration to the pods, the specialised worker group cannot ensure repelling non-spark pods, which could potentially lead to undesired, potentially unsuitable pods being scheduled in the specialised worker group.\r\n\r\nThis can be very important for many use cases, such as running spark jobs in [AWS spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), which can be reclaimed at anytime by Amazon thus making it not suitable for every kind of workload.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, it's a new feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded both unit tests and k8s integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid to use deprecated PyArrow API `open_stream`. It was deprecated as of 0.12.0 (https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/3244).\r\n\r\nRoot cause is that we use separate forked process and each process emits the warning (printing once via \"default\" filter at `warnings` package); however, we should avoid to use deprecated APIs anyway.\r\n\r\nIn the current master, it was fixed when we upgrade PyArrow from 0.10.0 to 0.12.0 at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn  origin way to judge if a DataSet is empty by \r\n```\r\n def isEmpty: Boolean = withAction(\"isEmpty\", limit(1).groupBy().count().queryExecution) { plan =>\r\n    plan.executeCollect().head.getLong(0) == 0\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwill add two shuffles by `limit()`, `groupby() and count()`, then collect all data to driver.\r\nIn this way we can avoid `oom` when collect data to driver. But it will trigger all partitions calculated and add more shuffle process.\r\n\r\nWe change it to \r\n```\r\n  def isEmpty: Boolean = withAction(\"isEmpty\", select().queryExecution) { plan =>\r\n    plan.executeTake(1).isEmpty\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAfter these pr, we will add a column pruning to origin LogicalPlan and use `executeTake()` API.\r\nthen we won't add more shuffle process and just compute only one partition's data in last stage.\r\nIn this way we can reduce cost when we call `DataSet.isEmpty()` and won't bring memory issue to driver side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

a table which created by an old Spark version.\r\nAfter recreated the table, the issue will be gone.\r\n\r\nAfter deep dive, the root cause is this external table is a non-partitioned table but the `LOCATION` set to a partitioned path {{/tablename/dt=yyyymmdd}}. The partitionSpec is inferred.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAbove error message is very confused. We need more details about assert failure information.\r\n\r\nThis issue caused by `PartitioningAwareFileIndex#inferPartitioning()`. For non-HiveMetastore Spark, it's useful.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemoving the sorting of PySpark SQL Row fields that were previously sorted by name alphabetically for Python versions 3.6 and above. Field order will now match that as entered. Rows will be used like tuples and are applied to schema by position. For Python versions < 3.6, the order of kwargs is not guaranteed and therefore will be sorted automatically as in previous versions of Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis caused inconsistent behavior in that local Rows could be applied to a schema by matching names, but once serialized the Row could only be used by position and the fields were possibly in a different order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Row fields are no longer sorted alphabetically but will be in the order entered. For Python < 3.6 `kwargs` can not guarantee the order as entered, so `Row`s will be automatically sorted. \r\n\r\nAn environment variable \"PYSPARK_ROW_FIELD_SORTING_ENABLED\" can be set that will override construction of `Row` to maintain compatibility with Spark 2.x. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests are run with PYSPARK_ROW_FIELD_SORTING_ENABLED=true and added new test with unsorted fields for Python 3.6+\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-13T07:24:23Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T01:51:37Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T22:38:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22f00f72bb23d89319cd08823e04d1ef88d75ed9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26496/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26496/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26496/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14e691d3fba4dd416d88f84d0cb5e7489cd69aa3","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-remove-Row-sorting-SPARK-29748","ref":"pyspark-remove-Row-sorting-SPARK-29748","sha":"14e691d3fba4dd416d88f84d0cb5e7489cd69aa3","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe now have two different implementation for multi-units interval strings to CalendarInterval type values.\r\n\r\nOne is used to covert interval string literals to CalendarInterval. This approach will re-delegate the interval string to spark parser which handles the string as a `singleInterval` -> `multiUnitsInterval` -> eventually call `IntervalUtils.fromUnitStrings`\r\n\r\nThe other is used in `Cast`, which eventually calls `IntervalUtils.stringToInterval`. This approach is ~10 times faster than the other.\r\n\r\nWe should unify these two for better performance and simple logic. this pr uses the 2nd approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe should unify these two for better performance and simple logic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nwe shall not fail on existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is an issue for InSubquery expression.\r\nFor example, there are two tables `ta` and `tb` created by the below statements.\r\n```\r\n sql(\"create table ta(id Decimal(18,0)) using parquet\")\r\n sql(\"create table tb(id Decimal(19,0)) using parquet\")\r\n```\r\nThis statement below would thrown dataType mismatch exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\n sql(\"select * from ta where id in (select id from tb)\").show()\r\n```\r\nHowever, this similar statement could execute successfully.\r\n\r\n```\r\n sql(\"select * from ta where id in ((select id from tb))\").show()\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that, for `InSubquery` expression, it does not find a common type for two decimalType like `In` expression.\r\nBesides that, for `InSubquery` expression, it also does not find a common type for DecimalType and double/float/bigInt.\r\nIn this PR, I fix this issue by finding widerType for `InSubquery` expression when DecimalType

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo make SparkSQL's `cast as int` behavior consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL have a lot different cast behavior between types by default. We should make SparkSQL's cast behavior be consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. If user switches to PostgreSQL dialect now, they will\r\n\r\n- get an AnalysisException when they try to cast `ByteType`, `TimestampType` or `DateType` to `IntegerType`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-12T06:57:48Z","updated_at":"2019-12-15T02:33:00Z","closed_at":"2019-12-15T02:33:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4efcfe8c7a2f2320f3fef04b5788c1ca59ae3902","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/341ccca7d9e2038ceca70f88f4bb93d79e327bec","head":{"label":"amanomer:29840","ref":"29840","sha":"341ccca7d9e2038ceca70f88f4bb93d79e327bec","user":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203616393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM2MTYzOTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"amanomer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nrpad and lpad should return NULL when padstring parameter is empty\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReturns str, right-padded or left-padded with pad to a length of length. If str is longer than length, the return value is shortened to length characters. **In case of empty pad string, the return value is null.**\r\n\r\nDifferent behaviours of rpad and lpad function in case of empty pad string : \r\n```\r\nMysql : rpad ('hi', 5, '') => NULL,   lpad ('hi', 5, '') => NULL\r\nHive : rpad ('hi', 5, '') => NULL,  lpad ('hi', 5, '') => NULL\r\nOracle : rpad('hi', 5, '') => NULL,   lpad ('hi', 5, '') => NULL\r\nPostgresql : rpad ('hi', 5, '') => hi,  lpad ('hi', 5, '') => hi\r\npresto> select rpad('hi', 5, '');  select lpad('hi', 5, '');\r\nQuery

Thus, to implement a cascading drop, one needs to iterate all objects (tables, view, etc.) within the namespace (including its sub-namespaces recursively) and drop them one by one. This can have a negative impact on the performance when there are large number of objects.\r\n\r\nInstead, this PR proposes to change the default behavior of dropping a namespace to cascading such that implementing cascading/non-cascading drop is simpler without performance penalties.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new implementation of `fromDayTimeString` which strictly parses strings in day-time formats to intervals. New implementation accepts only strings that match to a pattern defined by the `from` and `to`. Here is the mapping of user's bounds and patterns:\r\n- `[+|-]D+ H[H]:m[m]:s[s][.SSSSSSSSS]` for **DAY TO SECOND**\r\n- `[+|-]D+ H[H]:m[m]` for **DAY TO MINUTE**\r\n- `[+|-]D+ H[H]` for **DAY TO HOUR**\r\n- `[+|-]H[H]:m[m]s[s][.SSSSSSSSS]` for **HOUR TO SECOND**\r\n- `[+|-]H[H]:m[m]` for **HOUR TO MINUTE**\r\n- `[+|-]m[m]:s[s][.SSSSSSSSS]` for **MINUTE TO SECOND**\r\n\r\nCloses #26327\r\nCloses #26358\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Improve user experience with Spark SQL, and respect to the bound specified by users.\r\n- Behave the same as other broadly used DBMS - Oracle and MySQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, before:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '10 11:12:13.123' HOUR TO MINUTE;\r\ninterval 1 weeks 3 days 11 hours 12 minutes\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '10 11:12:13.123' HOUR TO MINUTE;\r\nError in query:\r\nrequirement failed: Interval string must match day-time format of '^(?<sign>[+|-])?(?<hour>\\d{1,2}):(?<minute>\\d{1,2})$': 10 11:12:13.123(line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSELECT INTERVAL '10 11:12:13.123' HOUR TO MINUTE\r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `IntervalUtilsSuite`\r\n- By `ExpressionParserSuite`\r\n- Updated

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo make SparkSQL's `cast as timestamp` behavior consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL have a lot different cast behavior between types by default. We should make SparkSQL's cast behavior be consistent with PostgreSQL when spark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. If user switches to PostgreSQL dialect now, they will\r\n\r\n- get an AnalysisException when they input any data type except `StringType` and `DateType`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen whole stage codegen `HashAggregateExec`, create the hash map when we begin to process inputs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSort-merge join completes directly if the left side table is empty. If there is an aggregate in the right side, the aggregate will not be triggered at all, but its hash map is created during codegen and can't be released.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf a task is failing due to a corrupt cached Kafka producer and the task is retried in the same executor, then the task may get the same producer over and over again. After several retries the query may stop.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm invalidating the old cached producers for a specific key and re-opening a new one. This will reduce the possibility of a faulty producer re-use. It must be mentioned if a producer under the key is used by another task, then in won't be closed. The functionality is similar to the consumer side

are the changes needed?\r\nIncrease producer side availability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current parse and analyze flow for DELETE is: 1, the SQL string will be firstly parsed to `DeleteFromStatement`; 2, the `DeleteFromStatement` be converted to `DeleteFromTable`. However, the SQL string can be parsed to `DeleteFromTable` directly, where a `DeleteFromStatement` seems to be redundant.\r\n\r\nIt is the same for UPDATE.\r\n\r\nThis pr removes the unnecessary `DeleteFromStatement` and `UpdateTableStatement`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes the codes for DELETE and UPDATE cleaner, and keep align with MERGE INTO.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted tests and new

If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake SparkSQL's `cast to boolean` behavior be consistent with PostgreSQL when \r\nspark.sql.dialect is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSparkSQL and PostgreSQL have a lot different cast behavior between types by default. We should make SparkSQL's cast behavior be consistent with PostgreSQL when `spark.sql.dialect` is configured as PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. If user switches to PostgreSQL dialect now, they will\r\n\r\n* get an exception if they input a invalid string, e.g \"erut\", while they get `null` before;\r\n\r\n* get an exception if they input `TimestampType`, `DateType`, `LongType`, `ShortType`, `ByteType`, `DecimalType`, `DoubleType`, `FloatType` values,  while they get `true` or `false` result before.\r\n\r\nAnd here're evidences for those unsupported types from PostgreSQL:\r\n\r\ntimestamp:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('2019-11-11' as timestamp) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type timestamp without time zone to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\ndate:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('2019-11-11' as date) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type date to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nbigint:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('20191111' as bigint) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type bigint to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nsmallint:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast(2019 as smallint) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type smallint to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nbytea:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('2019' as bytea) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type bytea to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\ndecimal:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('2019' as decimal) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type numeric to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nfloat:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select cast(cast('2019' as float) as boolean);\r\nERROR:  cannot cast type double precision to boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded and tested

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen set `spark.yarn.jars=/xxx/xxx` which is just a no schema path, spark will throw a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nThe reason is hdfs will return null if pathFs.globStatus(path) is not exist, and spark just use `pathFs.globStatus(path).filter(_.isFile())` without check it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid NullPointerException.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. User will get a FileNotFoundException instead NullPointerException when `spark.yarn.jars` does not have schema and not exists.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd UT.","created_at":"2019-11-11T04:40:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T02:56:23Z","closed_at":"2019-11-16T00:17:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a69af01014c511b095b0d261691096c5078cacc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42e468b1fca2b183a218dca633f6d2e65b09de1b","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:check-yarn-jars-path-exist","ref":"check-yarn-jars-path-exist","sha":"42e468b1fca2b183a218dca633f6d2e65b09de1b","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

The data parallelism of the result RDD can be dramatically increased, when reading a lot of partitions with a lot of files.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a config to limit the maximum of the data parallelism for scanning Hive partitioned table, when we can not convert the Hive table to datasource table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAlthough users can also do coalesce by themselves, this patch proposes to add a config to limit the maximum of the data parallelism. Because:\r\n\r\n1. end-users might not understand details and get confused by big partition number. end-users might not know why/when/where to add coalesce.\r\n2. end-users need to add coalesce to each time Hive table scan. It is annoying. From the perspective of of cluster operator, it is much easier to config instead of asking each end-users to know the details and add coalesce.\r\n\r\nAlthough we convert Hive table scan to datasource table scan most of time, we still have some inconvertible tables. For datasource table scan node, the parallelism is controlled by configs `spark.default.parallelism` and `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`.\r\n\r\nBut for Hive table scan node, we have nothing to control it.\r\n\r\nSo currently, when reading datasource table, end-users do not worry parallelism. When reading Hive table, end-users need to add custom coalesce hints if big parallelism is seen.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, if not set the config.\r\n\r\nIf set a maximum value by the config, when scanning Hive partitioned table, once the number of partitions exceeds the maximum, Spark coalesces the result RDD.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-11T02:20:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:11Z","closed_at":"2019-11-22T07:51:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2917afba9c92f6705e65a404855c48843683938d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b7615c79ad83b4078c01d0864cdb9989e411624","head":{"label":"viirya:hive-scan-max-parallelism","ref":"hive-scan-max-parallelism","sha":"2b7615c79ad83b4078c01d0864cdb9989e411624","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `scala-maven-plugin` to `4.3.0` for Scala `2.13.1`.\r\nWe tried 4.2.4, but it's reverted due to Windows build issue. Now, `4.3.0` has a Window fix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nScala 2.13.1 seems to break the binary compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe need to upgrade `scala-maven-plugin` to bring the the following fixes for the latest Scala 2.13.1.\r\n- https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/issues/363\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues/698\r\n\r\nAlso, `4.3.0` has the following Window fix.\r\n- https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/issues/370 (4.2.4 throws error on Windows)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- For now, we don't support Scala-2.13. This PR at least needs to pass the existing Jenkins with Maven to get prepared for Scala-2.13.\r\n- `AppVeyor` passed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable [GitHub Action Cache on Maven local repository](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#java---maven) for the following goals.\r\n1. To reduce the chance of failure due to the Maven download flakiness.\r\n2. To speed up the build a little bit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to the GitHub Action Cache limitation, it seems that we cannot put all into a single cache. It's ignored like the following.\r\n- **.m2/repository is 680777194 bytes**\r\n```\r\n/bin/tar -cz -f /home/runner/work/_temp/01f162c3-0c78-4772-b3de-b619bb5d7721/cache.tgz -C /home/runner/.m2/repository .\r\n3\r\n##[warning]Cache size of 680777194 bytes is over the 400MB limit, not saving cache.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNot only for the speed up, but also for reducing the Maven download flakiness, we had better enable caching on local maven repository. The followings are the failure examples in these days.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/295869450\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd AlterViewAsStatement and make ALTER VIEW ... QUERY go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC v // success and describe the view v from my_catalog\r\nALTER VIEW v SELECT 1 // report view not found as there is no view v in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. When running ALTER VIEW ... QUERY, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the view name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nunit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `persist` on RDD which is used for more than one action.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are three actions: `reduceByKey`, `sortBy`, and `collect`. But RDD `data` is not persisted, which will cause re-computation.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse persist on RDD which is used for more than one action.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRDD `dataset.toDF.rdd` will generate two rdds: training and validation. Some actions will be operated on these two rdds, but `dataset.toDF.rdd` is not persisted, which will cause re-computation.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

After state `PARSE_SIGN`, it directly goes to  `PARSE_UNIT_VALUE` when takes a space character as the end. So when there are some white spaces come before the real unit value, it fails to parse, we should add a new state like `TRIM_VALUE` to trim all these spaces.\r\n\r\nHow to re-produce, which aim the revisions since  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26256 is merged\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect cast(v as interval) from values ('+     1 second') t(v);\r\nselect cast(v as interval) from values ('-     1 second') t(v);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new expression `MakeInterval` and register it as the function `make_interval`. The function accepts the following parameters:\r\n- `years` - the number of years in the interval, positive or negative. The parameter is multiplied by 12, and added to interval's `months`.\r\n- `months` - the number of months in the interval, positive or negative.\r\n- `weeks` - the number of months in the interval, positive or negative. The parameter is multiplied by 7, and added to interval's `days`.\r\n- `hours`, `mins` - the number of hours and minutes. The parameters can be negative or positive. They are converted to microseconds and added to interval's `microseconds`.\r\n- `seconds` - the number of seconds with the fractional part in microseconds precision. It is converted to microseconds, and added to total interval's `microseconds` as `hours` and `minutes`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_interval(2019, 11, 1, 1, 12, 30, 01.001001);\r\n2019 years 11 months 8 days 12 hours 30 minutes 1.001001 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To improve user experience with Spark SQL, and allow users making `INTERVAL` columns from other columns containing `years`, `months` ... `seconds`. Currently, users can make an `INTERVAL` column from other columns only by constructing a `STRING` column and cast it to `INTERVAL`. Have a look at the `IntervalBenchmark` as an example.\r\n- To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which provides such function:\r\n```sql\r\n# SELECT make_interval(2019, 11);\r\n   make_interval\r\n--------------------\r\n 2019 years 11 mons\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By new tests for the `MakeInterval` expression to `IntervalExpressionsSuite`\r\n- By tests in `interval.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-09T16:00:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T19:45:59Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T22:35:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9a8e7742fc81cdbc2075d03f3851a1ea9b0d582","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f9a3bb846f2f7f40a3be4c13ccc201a09aaf554","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:make_interval","ref":"make_interval","sha":"0f9a3bb846f2f7f40a3be4c13ccc201a09aaf554","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRename config \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"spark.sql.dialect.spark.ansi.enabled\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe relation between \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" and \"spark.sql.dialect\" is confusing, since the \"PostgreSQL\" dialect should contain the features of \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\".\r\n\r\nTo make things clearer, we can rename the \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"spark.sql.dialect.spark.ansi.enabled\", thus the option \"spark.sql.dialect.spark.ansi.enabled\" is only for Spark dialect.\r\n\r\nFor the casting and arithmetic operations, runtime exceptions should be thrown if \"spark.sql.dialect\" is \"spark\" and \"spark.sql.dialect.spark.ansi.enabled\" is true or \"spark.sql.dialect\" is PostgresSQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, the config name changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting
