with #2908 \nThis patch tries to support multiple dimensions especially for ExtractionDimensionSpec and LookupDimensionSpec.\n\nIt contains all described in #2908:\n1. changing `DimensionSpec` to accept list of dimensions\n2. enabling `StorageAdapter`s to provide dimensionSelector for multi-dimensional DimensionSpec\n   `makeDimensionSelectorUndecorated()` of  `IncrementalIndex`, `IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter`, and `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` are changed.\n3. forcing Cursor-based processing for queries with multi-dimensional DimensionSpec\n   search query is changed to use cursor-based processing when multi-dimensional spec is used.\n4. enabling `ExtractionFn` to accept list of String as input \n   apply(Object) of `ExtractionFn` is implemented to accept list of String input with check routine that Object is `List<String>`.\n5. changing lookup map from `Map<String, String>` to `Map<Object, String>`\n   to support both single-dimensional and multi-dimensional keys\n6. multi-dimensional lookup uses `Map<MultiKey, String>`\n   `org.apache.commons.collections.keyvalue.MultiKey` is used to represent multi-dimensional lookup key\n\nAnd namespace lookup is also changed to make MultiKey lookup table if multiple key columns are specified.\n\nAny advice,

new local cache implementation using [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) as the cache.\n\nfixes #2411 \n\n![caffeinehot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8213081/15588813/8dce1828-2344-11e6-8c18-0c3ea84acc12.png)\n\nWe currently use this in production as l1 of a hybrid cache and memcached as the l2. The graph above shows the node mean TopN query time for production servers with and without using this cache in l1 (caffeine = false implies straight-to-memcached).\n\nThis extension _requires_ java 8 to run, and therefore has a special profile that activates in the druid.io parent pom only when java8 is detected. This detection will eventually have to be improved to account for java9+\n\nPackaging is accomplished by calling pull-deps a second time during the distribution build **IFF** the caller is using java8. Otherwise it retains the prior behavior.\n\nIn order to get this to work correctly, I had to put the distribution target in its own special rule set that will put it at the END of all other modules, including java8-only ones. If anyone else has a cleaner way of doing this, please let me know.\n\nThis is a contribution of

is the Proposal https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/druid-development/GE8QtSMdoFo/BhEkLIOjBAAJ\n\nIn our case, we need to keep all details instead of rollup duplicate rows, so here is the patch.\nWe believe there should be no impact to query part if not rollup\n\nIn this patch\n1. we add an \"rollup\" option in IncrementalIndexSchema and a new NoRollupGranularitySpec\n2. add \"rollup\" option to mergeQueryableIndex() and merge() in IndexMerger. and do not use CombiningIterable in rowMergerFn if not rollup, then all rows will be kept without combine duplicate rows to one row. If not rollup, it is ordered by timestamp instead of timeAndDims\n3. changes to related classes and doc due to the 1,2\n4. in IncrementalIndex, do not directly use facts map, use FactsHolder instead. if rollup, use RollupFactsHolder which just delegates to the original facts map. if no rollup, use PlainFactsHolder, which keeps all duplicate rows in a list as ConcurrentMap < Long, Queue < Pair < TimeAndDims, Integer > > >, the key is timestamp, the value is the list of < timeAndDims,rowNum > pair.\n5. update IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter to use FactsHolder instead of the facts map\n6. add rollup info to SegmentMetadataQuery, also in metadata.drd when persist\n7.

PR is a fix for the issue described in #2993:\n\nTo restate the issue, it is possible that the location of a task (specifically the worker's port) reported by the RTR is incorrect. This may happen if a MM is restarted and recovers the tasks that were running when it was shutdown but chooses different port assignments for the tasks. The RTR's view of the task locations will get updated eventually through ZK announcements, but for a period of time there will be inconsistencies. If we try to communicate with a task during this time, it's possible that we might end up sending a command to an unintended recipient which isn't a great situation.\n\nThere's two main changes in this PR:\n\n1) On the ChatHandler side, if the incoming request has a X-Druid-Task-Id header, validate that this header matches the task's ID and if not return a 404. As part of the response, set the X-Druid-Task-Id header with the task's actual ID.\n\n2) On the KafkaIndexTaskClient's side, set X-Druid-Task-Id header in the request, and if we get back a 404 and the header in the response doesn't match the ID of the task we thought we were talking to, wait for a bit and retry later.\n\n(2) is complicated by the issue that the previous implementation of KafkaIndexTaskClient assumed that the host and port passed in during a request would stay constant across retries. Since this is no longer the case, in order to keep the retry logic abstracted from the caller, we need to pass in a TaskLocationProvider that's defined by the caller which can be queried on each retry to detect when the host and port have changed.\n\nAlso added unit tests for KafkaIndexTaskClient since the logic has become somewhat more complex.\n\nCloses #2993

patch introduces a GroupByStrategy concept and two strategies: \"v1\"\nis the current groupBy strategy and \"v2\" is a new one. It also\nintroduces a merge buffers concept in DruidProcessingModule, to try to better\nmanage memory used for merging.\n\nBoth of these are described in more detail in #2987.\n\nThere are two goals of this patch:\n1. Make it possible for historical/realtime nodes to return larger groupBy\n   result sets, faster, with better memory management.\n2. Make it possible for brokers to merge streams when there are no order-by\n   columns, avoiding materialization.\n\nThis patch does not do anything to help with memory management on the broker\nwhen there are order-by columns or when there are nested queries. That could\npotentially be done in a future patch.\n\nBenchmarks:\n\nmaster\n\n```\nBenchmark                                       (numSegments)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schemaAndQuery)  Mode  Cnt

#2940 \n\nCurrently the CachingClusterClient, which is the queryRunner for broker node, puts all segments within the query interval into segment descriptors which is then retrieved from cache or other servers. This can be optimized by filtering out data segments with singleDimensionShardSpec that does not match the query filter. For instance, dataSegment with dimension \"id\" and value from \"a\" to \"b\" does not need to be retrieved for query with selection filter \"id\"=\"person\".\n\nThis PR addresses this by calculating the range of possible values of the given dimension for the query filter, and intersect the range of filter with range of data segments to determine whether or not to add the segment to descriptors for retrieval.\n","created_at":"2016-05-18T00:58:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:05Z","closed_at":"2016-06-24T21:52:19Z","merged_at":"2016-06-24T21:52:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a08398977899630556ebfe1e4c29379a8a39858","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20/labels","id":1571409,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOQ==","number":20,"title":"0.9.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":248,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:56Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/20aa962b62aec7b1ff5e72f1e39f50882514e8eb","head":{"label":"acslk:feature-prun","ref":"feature-prun","sha":"20aa962b62aec7b1ff5e72f1e39f50882514e8eb","user":{"login":"acslk","id":11131839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11131839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk","html_url":"https://github.com/acslk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58234003,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIzNDAwMw==","name":"druid","full_name":"acslk/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"acslk","id":11131839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11131839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk","html_url":"https://github.com/acslk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/acslk/druid","description":"Column

current segment balancing algorithm uses a cost function which has some unintended effects on the distribution of segments in the cluster. While it keeps the total number of segments roughly balanced across nodes, it does not evenly distribute segments within a given interval. This leads to many queries hitting only a fraction of the historical nodes in the cluster.\n\nThis is a proposal to revamp the cost function to address those shortcoming and improve overall segment distribution.\n\nTL;DR here's how segment distribution has improved in the days since we rolled out this improved cost function to one of our Druid clusters (each dot is a segment, each color represents a different data source).\n\n![c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/815147/15304742/e477a38e-1b73-11e6-8386-ae5bc0ea78a9.gif)\n### Issues with our existing cost function\n\nHere is a breakdown of the issues with the current cost function\n1. Segments tend to form clusters with large gaps in between\n   \n   If you have take segments roughly 30 days apart, the existing `gapPenalty` causes the cost of putting a segment anywhere between those two to be higher than adding a segment that overlaps with them. This causes the balancing to converge to form clusters of segments ~30 days apart as seen below.\n   \n   ![c_t_000](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/815147/15303719/0bf09de0-1b6e-11e6-9c47-f0eae4ca08a5.jpg)\n2. Segments for recent time intervals tend to be distributed unevenly\n   \n   The recencyPenalty, in combination with the gapPenalty, makes the cost function non-trivial for recent segments and causes strange gaps of data within the most recent 7 days worth of data.\n   \n   ![h_t_000](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/815147/15303999/b321cb2e-1b6f-11e6-9651-4e031baefc76.jpg)\n3. The base joint cost between two segments is tied to segment byte sizes. This causes cost to be affected by different levels compression, and not necessarily tied to the actual cost of scanning a segment. \n### Improved cost function\n\nOur improved cost function is designed to be simple and have the following properties:\n1. Our cost function reflect the cost of scanning a segment.\n2. The joint cost should reflect the likelihood of segments being scanned simultaneously, i.e. the joint cost of querying two time-slices should decrease based on how far apart they are.\n3. Our cost function should be additive, i.e. given three intervals A, B, and C, cost(A, B union C) = cost(A, B) + cost(A, C)\n\nTo satisfy 1. we will assume that the cost of scanning a unit time-slice of data is constant. This means our cost function will only depend on segment intervals.\n\n> Note: In practice, this means that if all segments in a cluster have the same segment granularity, then the cpu time spent scanning each partition should be roughly constant. Ensuring the unit of computation is constant is also good practice to reduce variance in segment scan times across the cluster.\n\nTo model the joint cost of querying two time-slices and satisfy 2., we use an exponential decay `exp(-lambda * t)`, where lambda defines the rate at which the interaction decays, and t is the relative time differences between two to time slices. Currently lambda is set to give the decay a half-life of 24 hours.\n\nSince we assume the cost of querying each time-slice is constant, we can compute the joint cost of two segments by simply integrating over the segment intervals, i.e. for two segments X and Y covering intervals [x_0, x_1) and [y_0, y_1) respectively, our joint cost becomes:\n\n<img width=\"245\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-16 at 3 41 55 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/815147/15306118/c52cdf72-1b7c-11e6-981c-923336ee554b.png\">\n\nThis has the nice property of being additive as in 3. and of having a closed form solution.\n\nOne nice side-effect of additivity is that re-indexing the same data at different segment granularities (e.g. going form hourly segments to daily segments) will not affect the joint cost, assuming the cost of scanning a unit of time stays the same per shard.\n\nSegments of the same datasources are of course more likely to be queried simultaneously, so we multiply the cost by a constant factor (2 in this case) if the two segments are from the same data source. This ensures that if two datasources are distributed equally, we are more likely to spread them across servers.\n\nHopefully this all makes sense, but comments are of course welcome.\n\nRegarding performance, the new cost function is more expensive to compute than the existing one, but thanks to the optimizations in #2910 it will not be worse than what we have in our current release, and maybe even a little bit faster still.\n\nThe results of rolling out this new cost function speak for themselves. You can see how segment distribution has massively improved in our Druid cluster for the problem cases depicted above.

Adds an option to let indexing service tasks pull their lookup tier from the datasource they are working for.\n\nThis allows things spawned via indexing service to tag themselves with the datasource they are running for.\n\nAs a quick note so it isn't lost in the comments below:\n\nThis uses an object with optional injection fields. I had a hard time figuring out how to make an optional binding in 4.0-beta (4.0 has [OptionalBinder](https://google.github.io/guice/api-docs/4.0/javadoc/com/google/inject/multibindings/OptionalBinder.html) which might work later) This is the best workaround I could come up with. Make an object bound everywhere (via `MetricsModule`), but the fields in the object be optional, and therefore can be bound whenever it makes
