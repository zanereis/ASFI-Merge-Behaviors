Changes\r\n1. Deprecated `KafkaWrapper` in favor of `GobblinKafkaConsumerClient`. \r\n2. Introduced a new interface called `GobblinKafkaConsumerClient` which is wrapper on top of kafka-consumer. The interface is mostly ported from `KafkaWrapper` except that all request and response objects are defined in gobblin. `KafkaWrapper` used response objects from kafka-08 client library.\r\n3. Added `Kafka08ConsumerClient` which is mostly code that already existed in `KafkaWrapper.KafkaOldAPI`. I have deprecated `KafkaWrapper.KafkaOldAPI` and copied its code into `Kafka08ConsumerClient`\r\n4. Added `Kafka09ConsumerClient`\r\n5. Added a few `ConsumerRecord` interfaces that wrap a record consumed from Kafka. `ByteArrayBasedKafkaRecord` are used by kafka-08 clients that do not support serialization and deserialization of messages. `DecodeableKafkaRecord` are used by kafka-09/10 which support serialization and deserialization.\r\n6.

PR integrates a `SharedResourcesBroker` into gobblin execution, which is available through `WorkUnitState.getTaskBroker()`.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Moved a few classes from `gobblin-utility` to `gobblin-api` because `WorkUnitState` is in api.\r\n* Added instance variable `taskBroker` to `WorkUnitState`, as well as getter. This broker is only guaranteed to be available from within a task. In particular, on deserialization of the `TaskState` on the driver, the task broker is not populated. \r\n* Fixed a bug in creation of sub scoped brokers, which was using the wrong ancestor brokers for scopes with multiple parents (for multi_task_attempt has as parents both container and job, the creation of a multi_task_attempt scope instance was failing).\r\n* Added the needed brokers to the

KafkaWrapper.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-10T22:09:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T23:49:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T23:49:55Z","merged_at":"2017-01-16T23:49:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"b68c194903a610389005eabd5f649919471cc19f","assignee":{"login":"shrikanthshankar","id":11669147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11669147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/shrikanthshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"shrikanthshankar","id":11669147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11669147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/shrikanthshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":153127084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxMjcwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":336309078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYzMDkwNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/Source:Kafka","name":"Source:Kafka","color":"f7c6c7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":516481068,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MTY0ODEwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/Mode:Streaming","name":"Mode:Streaming","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ca7898e4c2e1b08d597564549e2530e797483319","head":{"label":"shrikanthshankar:kafka-streaming","ref":"kafka-streaming","sha":"ca7898e4c2e1b08d597564549e2530e797483319","user":{"login":"shrikanthshankar","id":11669147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11669147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/shrikanthshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78359359,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODM1OTM1OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"shrikanthshankar/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shrikanthshankar","id":11669147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11669147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shrikanthshankar","html_url":"https://github

various scripts and fixed bugs to enable current Gobblin cluster code to run as a standalone cluster. \r\n\r\nSteps to run Gobblin standalone cluster on your *nix based machines: \r\n\r\n**A. Build** \r\n1. Checkout the code and build (or use Gobblin distribution after this is released)\r\n2. Build using: ./gradlew clean build \r\n3. A distribution gz will be built with the name of: gobblin-distribution-0.9.0-*.tar.gz\r\n\r\n**B. Zookeeper Setup**\r\n1. Download Zookeeper from: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/zookeeper/ and extract it to say /foo/bar/zk/\r\n2. Run Zookeeper: /foo/bar/zk/bin/zkServer.sh start \r\n(default endpoint is 2181, which is what is set in Gobblin conf as well, so you need not edit zoo.cfg)\r\nBonus: You may want to run Exhibitor to observe your Zookeeper (really helpful to see how the job execution is progressing later) \r\n\r\n**C. Gobblin Setup**\r\n1. Extract distribution: gobblin-distribution-0.9.0-*.tar.gz to /foo/bar; it will create a sub directory: /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/ \r\n2. Create a directory for your job configurations (such as wikipedia.pull) and copy your pull files there, say: /foo/bar/job-conf/ \r\n3. Edit /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/conf/standalone/application.conf and set gobblin.cluster.job.conf.path to /foor/bar/job-conf/ \r\n4. Minor hack (pending bug fix): Copy /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/conf/standalone/log4j-cluster.properties to /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/ \r\nBonus: Defaults should work fine, but if you prefer you can edit conf files (application.conf and reference.conf within /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/conf/standalone/) to change work dir, etc. \r\n\r\n**D. Run Standalone Cluster**\r\nWithin directory: /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/\r\n1. Start master by running: ./bin/gobblin-cluster-master.sh start \r\n2.1. Start one worker by running: ./bin/gobblin-cluster-worker.sh start\r\n2.2. OR Start multiple workers by running: \r\n./bin/gobblin-cluster-worker.sh start --workerid 1 \r\n./bin/gobblin-cluster-worker.sh start --workerid 2 \r\n.. and so on\r\nNote: Each instance will get its own log file, such as: master.out, worker.single.out (if no workerid is specified) or worker.1.out, worker.2.out (if workerid is specified), etc.  \r\n3. In the logs you will see your job / task execution details and the job output in respective directories as per your pull file \r\n\r\n**Mini runbook:** \r\n1. Build fails for random test failure: Try building again, Gobblin suffers from transient test failures which has mostly been resolved but still is work in progress. \r\n2. Gobblin fails to connect to Zookeeper and you see Connection Refused in the logs: check if Zookeeper is bind on port 2181, if not check Zookeeper conf and logs, and make sure /foo/bar/gobblin-dist/conf/standalone/application.conf has the right zookeeper connection string \r\n3. Everything seems correct but job was not run: check if you have set the gobblin.cluster.job.conf.path correctly to where your job configuration files reside \r\n4.

is part of fixing an issue with using static state in ZookeeperBasedJobLock . This cause hard to find bugs if gobblin runs as continuously running process. This uncovered design issues with job lock instantiation which will be fixed in several commits.\r\n\r\nThe main issues are:\r\n- Inflexible current implementation of JobLockFactory which has the different implementations hard-coded.\r\n- Lack of per-lock-type factory abstraction. The purpose of such factories will be to keep shared state across locks of the same type. (This is what necessitates ZookeeperBasedJobLock to keep that state as static variables).\r\n\r\nThe main idea of the new design is to\r\n- Add the above concept of a job lock factory: it can instantiate locks and keep shared state among them\r\n- Add the concept of job lock factory manager. It instantiates and (optionally) configures job lock factories. Factory instance configuration will allow to move some of the properties (e.g. the root directory for file-based locks) from job configs to instance level configs.\r\n\r\nThe first commit does some refactoring of FileBasedLock to fit the new design. Changes:\r\n- Rename JobLockFactory to LegacyJobLockFactoryManager to free up the name.\r\n- Move shared state out of FileBasedJobLock to FileBasedJobLockFactory which will eventually implement the new factory interface.\r\n\r\n@htran1 can you review ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-05T22:47:17Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T03:21:51Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T03:21:46Z","merged_at":"2017-01-06T03:21:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7fbfd2ee336a7a266130ee579fe4afb001200d92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/01f5d650ea2ca95da43704bdcad4551929c2cdc4","head":{"label":"chavdar:zk_joblock_static","ref":"zk_joblock_static","sha":"01f5d650ea2ca95da43704bdcad4551929c2cdc4","user":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31112986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExMjk4Ng==","name":"gobblin-1","full_name":"chavdar/gobblin-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar/gobblin-1","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/contents/{+path}","comp

PR changes `ScopeInstance` to make them less restrictive.\r\n\r\n* `ScopeInstance` is now an even more generic interface, and the broker only interacts with it using `equals`, `hashCode`, `getType`, and `toString` methods. This allows scopes to store additional metadata, for example a job name and job id, instead of a single generic id.\r\n* `ScopeType` now has a method `rootScope()` that returns the root of the DAG of scope types.\r\n* Brokers with `null` scope are no longer allowed. The top level broker is now at the `rootScope()` level.\r\n\r\nThe effective changes in code are as follows:\r\n* `ScopeInstanceImpl` becomes `ScopeWrapper` which is used internally to store a `ScopeInstance` and references to its ancestors. A lot of changes are just renaming this.\r\n* Public methods on the broker still return `ScopeInstance`. `SharedResourcesBrokerImpl` additionally has package-private methods to get the wrapped scope.\r\n* Added `SubscopedBrokerBuilder` interface (equivalent to the existing `SharedResourcesBrokerImpl.SubscopedBrokerBuilder`) as the only correct way of creating sub brokers.\r\n* `GobblinScopes` became `GobblinScopeTypes`. Added `GobblinScopeInstance`, `JobScopeInstance`, and `TaskScopeInstance` that will have job and task metadata respectively (as needed).\r\n* Changes in tests are just updates to the slightly

Bug description ##\r\n`HiveSource` creates workunits even when there are no updates in the input\r\n\r\n## Root Cause ##\r\n`PartitionLevelWatermarker` creates dummy workunits that contain a vector of watermarks for every partition of a table. In case of _non-partitioned_ tables,`HiveSource` does not read previous watermarks from this vector. It uses `sourceState.getPreviousWorkUnitStatesByDatasetUrns()`. This causes a table to be processed every alternate execution. See below example\r\n\r\n**Run 1**\r\nPrevious HighWatermark is read from dummy workunit which is 0 (watermark is null). Hence creates a real workunit with table's modTime as expected high watermark.\r\n\r\n**Run 2**\r\nLet's say there were no updates between Run 1 and Run 2\r\nNo real workunits are created and only a dummy workunit is created with watermark 0\r\n\r\n**Run 3** \r\nSame as Run 1\r\n\r\n## Fix ##\r\nFix is to disable dummy workunit creation for _non-partitioned_ tables\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the usage of hive partition createTime as watermark check. This was a hack to fix a bug in distcp-ng. The current watermaking logic in `HiveSource` does not need this hack.\r\n\r\n@abti can you

PR has an implementation of a shared resources broker.\r\n\r\nSuggested order of review:\r\n\r\n1. Small changes to interfaces: Removed `AutoScopedSharedResourceFactory` and integrated its functionality into `SharedResourceFactory`. This simplifies usage a bit. For auto scoping, the broker will use the method `getAutoScope` to determine the scope at which a requested resource should be created. A simple factory will simply return `broker.leafScope()`.\r\n\r\n2. `DefaultBrokerCache` stores the shared objects keyed by factory, key, and scope using guava cache. It is thread safe and handles all accesses to the cache.\r\n\r\n3. `SharedResourcesBrokerImpl` is the actual implementation of `SharedResourcesBroker`. It uses a backing `DefaultBrokerCache` to get the shared objects. It also has a specific way of creating new brokers.\r\n\r\n4. `KeyedScopedConfigViewImpl` is the implementation of `ConfigView` and `ScopedConfigView`. It knows how to access correct keys in a `Config`.\r\n\r\n5. The other main classes are fairly straightforward.\r\n\r\n6. A bunch of tests for the broker.

an issue in QueryBasedSource with handling tables with $ in the name.\r\n\r\nOriginally, code kept track of two properties: SOURCE_ENTITY (used to access the source table) and EXTRACT_TABLE_NAME_KEY used as the table name in the extract (for writing to the destination). Often those are the same but they may differ if SOURCE_ENTITY has certain characters like $.\r\n\r\nLater commit changed the above behavior, always replacing SOURCE_ENTITY with a sanitized version. This broke access to tables whose names contain blacklisted characters like $.\r\n\r\nThe current commit fixes that by reverting to the original behavior. It also adds SourceEntity class to encapsulate the mapping between SOURCE_ENTITY and EXTRACT_TABLE_NAME_KEY.\r\n\r\nThe tests also adds a bunch of unit tests as QueryBasedSource sorely lacks those.\r\n\r\n@ibuenros @ydai1124  can you review

related to moving gobblin-azkaban to gobblin-modules.\r\n\r\n- Bulk move of the gobblin-azkaban/ directory\r\n- Removing azkaban dependencies from gobblin-data-management:\r\n   - Moved all *Job classes to gobblin-azkaban/ preserving namespace\r\n   - The trash class had a couple of methods which depended on azkaban.Props which I moved to TrashCollectorJob . The first method (a constructor) was only used by TrashCollectorJob . I couldn't find any usages of the second method but I moved it anyway. The change breaks backward compatibility for the Trash class but I couldn't find a way around it.

columns\r\n\r\nSee ETL-5244\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the MysqlExtractor where tinyint columns are always treated as ints.\r\nThere are MySQL jdbc driver setting (tinyInt1isBit=true and transformedBitIsBoolean=false) that\r\n can cause tinyint(1) columns to be treated as BIT/BOOLEAN columns. The default behavior is to\r\n treat tinyint(1) as BIT.\r\n \r\n Currently, {@link MysqlExtractor#getDataTypeMap()} uses the information_schema to check types.\r\n That does not do the above conversion. {@link #parseColumnAsString(ResultSet, ResultSetMetaData, int)}\r\n which does the above type mapping.\r\n \r\n On the other hand, SqlServerExtractor treats BIT columns as Booleans. So we can be in a bind\r\n where sometimes BIT has to be converted to an int (for backwards compatibility in MySQL) and\r\n sometimes to a Boolean (for SqlServer).\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add

on https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/pull/1419\r\n\r\nA POC for refactoring of gobblin-metrics to decrease external dependencies. No significant code changes:\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-libs/gobblin-metrics-base which contains the basic APIs/implementations for gobblin-metrics\r\n- Moved some common testing classes to gobblin.metrics.testing\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-modules/gobblin-metrics-influxdb which contains the InfluxDB reporter\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-modules/gobblin-metrics-graphite which contains the Graphite reporter\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-modules/gobblin-metrics-hadoop which contains the Hadoop counters reporter\r\n\r\nThe previous gobblin-metrics library now depends on all of the above for backwards compatibility reasons. It also contains GobblinMetrics and GobblinMetricsRegistry which have explicit dependency on the different reporters. Removing that dependency will require some code refactoring. The library has been moved to gobblin-metrics-libs/gobblin-metrics to decrease the number of top-level deirectories.\r\n\r\nSubsequent steps (other PRs):\r\n\r\n- Refactor GobblinMetrics to auto-discover reporters and move it to gobblin-metrics-base. At that point the gobblin-metrics library should be marked as deprecated.\r\n- Refactor gobblin-distribution to have 3 flavors: minimal (pre-defined reporters), standard (e.g. Kafka reporter and Hadoop counters reporter), full (all reporters), custom (user-specified reporters)\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-08T16:36:27Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T00:12:43Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T00:12:36Z","merged_at":"2016-12-21T00:12:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"51390c7e3a1492e6a29d599e63aabecbbe6f2b17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/603c35a365d4b50cd9983bec9a84051dfe2da5de","head":{"label":"chavdar:gobblin_metrics_refactoring_2","ref":"gobblin_metrics_refactoring_2","sha":"603c35a365d4b50cd9983bec9a84051dfe2da5de","user":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31112986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExMjk4Ng==","name":"gobblin-1","full_name":"chavdar/gobblin-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar/gobblin-1","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-1/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chavdar/gobblin-

POC for refactoring of gobblin-metrics to decrease external dependencies. No significant code changes\r\n\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-modules/gobblin-metrics-base which contains the basic APIs/implementations for gobblin-metrics\r\n- Moved some common testing classes to gobblin.metrics.testing\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-modules/gobblin-metrics-influxdb which contains the InfluxDB reporter\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-modules/gobblin-metrics-graphite which contains the Graphite reporter\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-modules/gobblin-metrics-hadoop which contains the Hadoop counters reporter\r\n- Created a new library gobblin-metrics-modules/gobblin-metrics-kafka which contains the Kafka reporter\r\n- The previous gobblin-metrics library now depends on all of the above for backwards compatibility reasons. It also contains GobblinMetrics and GobblinMetricsRegistry which have explicit dependency on the different reporters. Removing that dependency will require some code refactoring.\r\n\r\nSubsequent steps (other PRs):\r\n- Refactor GobblinMetrics to auto-discover reporters and move it to gobblin-metrics-base. At that point the gobblin-metrics library should be marked as deprecated.\r\n- Refactor gobblin-distribution to have 3 flavors: minimal (pre-defined reporters), standard (e.g. Kafka reporter and
