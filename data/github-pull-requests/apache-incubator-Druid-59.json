bug in TimedShutoffInputSourceReader where a timeout does not close all registered closeable\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen wrappingIterator.close() is called in the shutdown executor (of TimedShutoffInputSourceReader#decorateShutdownTimeout), the first thing it does is call exec::shutdownNow. This is because the Closer close closeables in LIFO order. Thus, the shutdown executor shutdowns itself first before shutting down the all the other registered closeable, which means that the closing of the other closeable may be interrupted, and the closing doesn't finish. This leave the closeable orphaned and running forever.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the above problem and make sure that the recordSuppliers close() methods are thread safe by adding synchronize block. I left the Closer the same as it is also a documented bug on Guava's Closer that it is not thread safe (google/guava#3900). We can keep this the same to avoid confusion and possibly update our Closer copy when the above issue is fixed. The CloseableIterator returned by TimedShutoffInputSourceReader#decorateShutdownTimeout also protect against concurrent close (scheduled exec vs normal closing) by using AtomicBoolean. Note that the shutdown of the executor in the TimedShutoffInputSourceReader is changed to be done outside of the thread running in that same executor. (Changed it to use shutdown now to automatically close when the scheduled timeout task finish running)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR separates out query timeout exceptions and avoids it from being thrown as a `QueryInterruptedException`. Timeout exceptions are now handled using a new  `QueryTimeoutException`. Timed out queries will now return HTTP 504 status code instead of the default HTTP 500 status. This makes it easier for clients to identify timeout exceptions and handle it accordingly.\r\nTo preserve  the query metrics behavior, timeout exceptions are still being clubbed under `query/interrupted/count`, but I feel \r\nthere should be a separate metric for query timeouts which can be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nFixes #10028 \r\nUpgrade Notes:\r\nCluster operators please note that with this patch, queries that have failed as a result of timeouts will return HTTP 504 status code instead of HTTP 500 status code. If there are any configured workflows that depend on HTTP 500 for timeout queries, please adjust them accordingly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR adjust the Kafka integration tests to slightly adjust the order in which the `druid.test.config.properties.kafka.test.property.*` overrides are applied, allowing `bootstrap.servers` to be overridden in the docker tests to point at Azure event hubs. Additionally, an option to disable transaction tests (Azure Event Hubs does not support Kafka transactions) in `ITKafkaIndexingServiceDataFormatTest`. Note that this PR does not actually add any new integration tests, it just allows more configurability making this stuff possible.\r\n\r\nWith these adjustments I was able to run `ITKafkaIndexingServiceDataFormatTest` and `ITKafkaIndexingServiceNonTransactionalSerializedTest` with all tests passing by overriding the kafka configs with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-Ddruid.test.config.properties.kafka.test.property.security.protocol=SASL_SSL\r\n-Ddruid.test.config.properties.kafka.test.property.sasl.mechanism=PLAIN\r\n-Ddruid.test.config.properties.kafka.test.property.sasl.jaas.config=\"org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username=\\\"$ConnectionString\\\" password=\\\"Endpoint=sb://{my-hub-name}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={key-name};SharedAccessKey={shared-key}\";\"\r\n-Ddruid.test.config.properties.kafka.test.property.bootstrap.servers={my-hub-name}.servicebus.windows.net:9093\r\n```\r\nFor `ITKafkaIndexingServiceNonTransactionalParallelizedTest`, I encountered an exception in the test itself with the admin client API trying to change the partition count for `testKafkaIndexDataWithKafkaReshardSplit`:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.InvalidRequestException: This most likely occurs because of a request being malformed by the client library or the message was sent to an incompatible broker.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue caused by #9638 being a bit over-ambitious and wiring up calcite arrays to druid array types, which resulted in array types leaking into the rest of the query engine.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes an bug where expressions with explicitly array typed output could incorrectly set `ExpressionPlan.Trait.SINGLE_INPUT_MAPPABLE` resulting in an incorrect dimension selector being used.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

was a styling regression in the web console that made the tick in the checkbox box not render.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94633641-d22b7700-0282-11eb-8233-3b8cf2c2ca78.png)\r\n\r\nThis is what it looked like in previously:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94633677-f25b3600-0282-11eb-8424-49d29c57a468.png)\r\n\r\nAfter looking into it I decided to switch away from using blueprint's `Checkbox` control.\r\n\r\nFor lists (like the one above) a more blueprint idiomatic way is to set an icon on a `MenuItem` this way does not require any css hacks.\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94634249-634f1d80-0284-11eb-9c00-059d538c83c7.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94634292-7feb5580-0284-11eb-9f57-972ad8270c1e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all other places where a Checkbox was used (log tailing in the ShowLogs dialog and WarningChecklist) I switched the control to a switch - which I think is nicer because it is bigger and more satisfying to use. It is also more common throughout the UI.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94634199-40246e00-0284-11eb-93d4-17b7f4e909ca.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/94634226-4fa3b700-0284-11eb-895d-a3434a366a10.png)\r\n\r\nI think it is an improvement in all cases.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n- Add `alt` to the `img` elements as is HTML convention for accessibility\r\n- Clean up resources in `ShowLog` component

Description\r\n\r\nAdd an E2E test for the web console workflow of reindexing a Druid datasource to change the secondary partitioning type. The new test changes dynamic to single dim partitions since the autocompaction test already does dynamic to hashed partitions.\r\n\r\nAlso, run the web console E2E tests in parallel to reduce CI time and change naming convention for test datasources to make it easier to map them to the corresponding test run.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments

Description\r\n\r\nThere are 2 issues in `VectorGroupByEngine`.\r\n\r\n- When `HashVectorGrouper` is used, `AggregatorAdaptors` is never closed.\r\n- When `BufferArrayGrouper` is used, the same `AggregatorAdaptors` can be used after it is closed since the same `grouper` instance is used to create `delegate`s which are `CloseableGrouperIterator`.\r\n\r\nThe von-vectorized groupBy engine doesn't have this issue because it creates a new `grouper` per `delegate`. This PR fixes the issue in `VectorGroupByEngine` by closing the `grouper` when the outer `VectorGroupByEngineIterator` is closed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#7076.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUpgraded the GCP HTTP client libraries to bring in the fix for https://github.com/googleapis/google-http-java-client/pull/447\r\nAlso added tests using `MockHttpTransport` to verify that skipping is happening as expected. There was another bug in the \r\n`org.apache.druid.storage.google.GoogleStorage#get(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, long)`.  offset was being set on the media downloader which is not actually used when `executeMediaAsInputStream` is invoked.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the clock drift issue while emitting metrics. ScheduledExecutorService is very much prone to clock drift especially in certain windows platforms (see this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56571647/why-does-the-java-scheduler-exhibit-significant-time-drift-on-windows). I have used [CronScheduler](https://github.com/TimeAndSpaceIO/CronScheduler) instead of ScheduledExecutorService, since CronScheduler provides proof against the clock drift issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nI have changed the `startMonitor` method in `MonitorScheduler` class. In this implementation, I have used `CronScheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate` method for periodically scheduling the monitor with constant rate. This method requires a `CronTask` which should be non-blocking, so the monitoring inside the cronTask is happening as an async process using executor thread pool.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the web console to load data by reindexing from Druid, the `Datasource` and `Interval` inputs are required during the `Connect` step. Unlike the `Datasource` input, the `Interval` input did not have a blue outline to indicate that it was required as the `IntervalInput` component did not support an `intent` property.\r\n\r\nInput

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for the vectorized group by engine to group by numeric columns with null values, using a similar approach to the non-vectorized engine of storing an extra byte in the key to hold information about whether the value is null or not. I modified the signature of the methods on `VectorColumnProcessorFactory` to include `ColumnCapabilities` for the selector, so that `GroupByVectorColumnSelectorFactory` methods could check `capabilities.hasNulls().isFalse()` to continue to use the existing processors, and only use the newly added null handling processors when there are actually null values to deal with.\r\n\r\nIn the process of adding tests for this, I also uncovered another issue with the `SpillingGrouper` when grouping on double values, where sometimes when making the round trip through serde they end up as floats, resulting in a cast exception when run through the comparator. To fix this issue I modified the comparators in `RowBasedGrouperHelper` to check for double typed keys and coerce both values to be doubles. A more proper fix would be to rework the SpillingGrouper completely so that the key serde just reads/writes directly instead of going through json generator, but that was too much for this PR, so I shall leave that for follow-up work.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR builds on top of #10401, and adds optimized selectors for constant expressions of all types, including single value dimension vector selectors. To aid in this, it adds a new utility class `ConstantVectorSelectors` to provide methods for creating constant `SingleValueDimensionVectorSelector`, `VectorValueSelector`, and `VectorObjectSelector`, for use for constant expression in `ExpressionVectorSelectors.makeSingleValueDimensionVectorSelector` (new in this PR), `ExpressionVectorSelectors.makeVectorValueSelector`, and `ExpressionVectorSelectors.makeVectorObjectSelector`.\r\n\r\nSupporting single value dimension selector constants is important because SQL queries such as:\r\n \r\n```\r\nSELECT TIME_FLOOR(__time, 'PT1H'), string2, SUM(long1 * double4) FROM foo WHERE string2 = '10' GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nplan into a native group by query with an expression virtual column with '10' as the constant expression in place of the 'string2' dimension, because Calcite assumes that a constant is cheaper than reading the column. However, since the single value dimension vector selector was not yet implemented, this would cause the query to be unable to vectorize, which is fixed in this PR (and a test added).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Description\r\nFollow-up to #10401, this PR adds an a new query context parameter, `vectorizeVirtualColumns`, which follows the same pattern as `vectorize` with options `false`, `true`, `force`.\r\n\r\nThis context parameter is layered on top of `vectorize`, which also must be set to `true` (the default) for a query to use vectorized engines, but by default is set to `false` to disable vectorization selectively for only queries with virtual columns by default.\r\n\r\nVectorizing virtual columns can be enabled by default by adding\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.query.default.context.vectorizeVirtualColumns=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the `runtime.properties`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR supports https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10294 where an issue is discussed that queries with lookups may sometimes fail unnecessarily due to the lookup only being available on some historicals. The query can succeed by avoiding those historicals. In this PR is an extension that tracks lookup status on the broker and adds a new ServerSelectorStrategy to avoid historicals that are missing required lookups. \r\n\r\nThis PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10427 is a small change to make server selection aware of the Query and would allow this extension so solve this issue without any other changes in core Druid. \r\n\r\nThis change just adds Query as a parameter to the ServerSelectorStratey and TierSelectorStrategy and provides this parameter in CachingClusteredClient, after segments  are found for a query and they are being fanned out across the cluster. A default method was added to the interface so existing implementations would not need to change. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is an extension to provide a solution for https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10294 where an issue is discussed that queries with lookups may sometimes fail unnecessarily due to the lookup only being available on some historicals. There is a small related change that would be required in core Druid, which is describe in a separate PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10428 \r\n\r\nServers are selected to query for particular segments in CachingClusteredClient using a ServerSelectorStrategy. This extension proposes a new FilteringServerSelectorStrategy that filters the servers provided by the TierSelectorStrategy and then applies another ServerSelectorStrategy (such as the existing random or connection count strategies). A new component, LookupStatusView is added to poll the nodeStatus endpoint on the coordinator for lookup status. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test

Description\r\nThis PR adds more robust timeout checking in `JsonParserIterator`, as well as more consistent exceptions thrown from the class (everything should now be wrapped in a `QueryInterruptedException`). Not entirely sure where to begin to try to write a test for this, so.. i haven't for now. However, none of the codepaths have really changed, everywhere that was previously throwing some subclass of RuntimeException will continue to do so, there is just a bit more variation on which exceptions will be thrown.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-23T20:13:56Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T03:50:07Z","closed_at":"2020-09-28T20:12:43Z","merged_at":"2020-09-28T20:12:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"64df71f25fb76e44f33f38e4abd9b51c2fbf834c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":222509152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1MDkxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Operations","name":"Area

The Requestlog has been updated to capture state changing api calls such as (POST/DELETE/UPDATE), so that this can be used to audit, debugging logs in order to identify who, what , when.  The code has been tested on our internal clusters. The log generated is presented as follows\r\n\r\nxx.xx.xx.xx DELETE https://druid-coord.xxxxxx.comm:4443/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/testdata_A1M_02_01 HTTP/1.1\r\nxx.xx.xx.xx POST https://druid-coord.xxxxxx.com:4443/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/testdata_A1M_02_02/markUnused HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nIf the community feels that it is too much to capture these details , in future we can provide updates  to capture in a separate file.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR adds a new `ingest/merge/count` metric that records how many intermediate persists have been merged for publishing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR enables the existing `ingest/merge/time` and `ingest/merge/cpu` metrics for `AppenderatorImpl`, which were only being updated in `RealtimePlumber`.\r\n\r\nMarking WIP since in a test cluster I'm seeing discrepancies in the total sums of `ingest/persist/count` and the new `ingest/merge/count`, which I would expect to be the same, need to investigate that further. Also I observed ingestion related metrics not being emitted when a batch task shuts down, which should be looked into as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR allows parallel batch ingestion to automatically determine `numShards` when `forceGuaranteedRollup` is used with hash partitioning.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished with a new phase of subtasks (`PartialDimensionCardinalityTask`). These subtasks build a map of `<Interval, HyperLogLogCollector>` where the HLL collector records the cardinality of the partitioning dimensions for each segment granularity interval in the input data.\r\n\r\nThe supervisor task aggregates the HLL collectors by interval, and determines the highest cardinality across all the intervals. This max cardinality is divided by `maxRowsPerSegment` to determine `numShards` automatically.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

last_compaction_state to sys.segments table\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSegments being compacted or not compacted have a big impact on query performance. \r\nCurrently it is not easy to verify questions like:\r\n- if performance of query can be improve by compaction \r\n- if a performance of query is bad, was it because segments for that interval was not compacted.\r\n- if a segment was compacted, what was it compacted with? was it compacted with the auto compaction config set?\r\n\r\nThis PR expose the lastCompactionState via the sys.segments table (so user can do query with slice/dice, group, time filter, etc) by using the lastCompactionState stored within the segment metadata. If a compactionState exist then the segment was compacted. This PR also change storing lastCompactionState as default for manual compaction in addition to auto compaction.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to know if the segment was compacted or not (ANY compaction), you can do `WHERE last_compaction_state is not null` and if you want to know if the segment was compacted with current auto compaction configs, you can do `WHERE last_compaction_state == '{current_auto_compact_config}'` \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way to know how much data is processed by task during ingestion. This PR adds `ingest/events/processedBytes` metric to emit number of bytes read since last emission time. \r\n\r\n - This PR adds `InputStats` class which is present in all task types and acts as holder for task level counts like processed bytes in this case. Thus standardized metrics throughout the task types can be added in future and emitted using `InputStatsMonitor` which is automatically initialized for all tasks\r\n\r\n- This PR provides convenient wrapper class named  `CountableInputEntity` which can warp any `InputEntity` to count number of bytes processed through that `InputEntity`, thus its easier for new implementations to emit this metric just by wrapping the base input entity in this while creating `InputEntityIteratingReader`\r\n\r\n- Since Kafka and Kinesis does not use `InputEntity`, therefore processed bytes is increment directly in `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner` as it has access to `InputStats`\r\n\r\n- This does not support Firehoses\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nConfiguring auto compaction with single_dim partitioning in the web console, requires specifying `maxRowsPerSegment` in the \"Tuning config\" field, rather than the \"Max rows per segment\" field. Specifying `maxRowsPerSegment` in the \"Tuning config\" also works for dynamic and hash partitions. To make the workflow consistent for all partitioning schemes, remove the \"Max rows per segment\" field so that the value is always specified in the \"Tuning config\" field.\r\n\r\n####

Implemented so far:\r\n* constants, identifiers\r\n* numeric unary operators: `-`\r\n* numeric binary operators: `+`,`-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`\r\n* numeric unary math functions: `atan`, `cos`, `cosh`, `cot`, `sin`, `sinh`, `tan`, `tanh`\r\n* numeric binary math functions: `max`, `min`, `pow`, `div`\r\n* time functions: `timestamp_floor` (for constant granularity inputs)\r\n* other functions (for both numeric and string inputs): `cast`, `parse_long`\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nOn the expression side, the primary new change is the addition of two new methods to `Expr`\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  default boolean canVectorize(InputBindingTypes inputTypes)\r\n  {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default <T> ExprVectorProcessor<T> buildVectorized(VectorInputBindingTypes inputTypes)\r\n  {\r\n    throw Exprs.cannotVectorize(this);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(and similar additions to `Function` and `ApplyFunction`) and where `ExprVectorProcessor` describes an interface for evaluating input vectors:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface ExprVectorProcessor<TOutput>\r\n{\r\n  ExprEvalVector<TOutput> evalVector(Expr.VectorInputBinding bindings);\r\n\r\n  ExprType getOutputType();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `ExprEvalVector` is the vectorized analog of `ExprEval`, but with methods that more closely mimic vectorized value and object selectors (`getLongVector`, `getNullVector`, `getObjectVector`, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n**additional design description TBD**\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                      (expression)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt     Score      Error  Units\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                        long1 * long2           1000000        false  avgt    5    73.194 ±   24.618  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                        long1 * long2           1000000         true  avgt    5     9.943 ±    4.011  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                    double1 * double3           1000000        false  avgt    5    87.064 ±   13.787  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                    double1 * double3           1000000         true  avgt    5     6.648 ±    0.914  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                      float1 + float3           1000000        false  avgt    5    69.627 ±   20.911  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                      float1 + float3           1000000         true  avgt    5     4.961 ±    0.665  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                            (long1 - long4) / double3           1000000        false  avgt    5   138.942 ±   39.220  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                            (long1 - long4) / double3           1000000         true  avgt    5    24.474 ±    7.421  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                max(double3, double5)           1000000        false  avgt    5    97.063 ±    6.140  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                max(double3, double5)           1000000         true  avgt    5    23.053 ±    4.847  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                min(double4, double1)           1000000        false  avgt    5    75.836 ±    5.153  ms/op\r\nExpressionVectorSelectorBenchmark.scan                                min(double4, double1)           1000000         true  avgt    5    18.574 ±    2.189  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

of https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10352.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the live reporting system for parallel ingestion described in #10352. The live reporting system is used to help checking status of each subtask. During ingestion, subtasks can now periodically send a report to the supervisor task including its state and metrics (`LiveMetricsReporter`). When the supervisor task receives a report from a running subtask, it assumes that the task is still running and pauses status checking with Overlord for a while. As a result, it is expected to talk less to the Overlord compared to before which could be a bottleneck in scaling ingestion system. When the supervisor task receives a report from a finished subtask, it still checks the final status of the task with Overlord so that the final status is consistent across the whole cluster. If some reports are missing, the supervisor has a timer per subtask which triggers status checking with the Overlord. As a result, missing reports doesn't affect to the progress of the supervisor task. These are implemented in `TaskMonitor` and `ParallelIndexPhaseRunner`.\r\n\r\nA new interface `IngestionMetrics` was added in this PR, but it has only no-op implementation yet. I'm planning to add actual implementations as follow-ups.\r\n\r\nFor reviewers, even though this PR adds more than 2000 of new lines, it should be not that hard to review as the new codes are mostly about new POJO classes for different report types.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Auto-compaction snapshot status API\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now, after users set up auto-compaction, the main ways of understanding how far it's progressed, whether it is progressing or stuck, if datasources are properly compacted, etc, are either:\r\n\r\n1. Looking at the segments yourself and deciding if they look good enough.\r\n2. Reading messages logged by the Coordinator periodically.\r\n\r\nNeither of these is a great solution. Instead this PR adds an API that tells you what you need to know regarding your auto compaction status and progress.\r\n\r\nThis API provides the status of the latest auto compaction run (coordinator duty run) including statistics and information from the coordinator. The API provides getting for a single dataSource or for all dataSources.\r\n\r\nThe API is in the format of:\r\n`/druid/coordinator/v1/compaction/status?dataSource={dataSource}`\r\n`/druid/coordinator/v1/compaction/status`\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n- only returns datasource which has/had auto compaction enabled.\r\n- Auto compaction scheduling status: \"NOT_ENABLED\" and \"RUNNING\" w.r.t the dataSource having an auto compaction config submitted to `/druid/coordinator/v1/config/compaction/` or not.\r\n- Datasource with auto compaction scheduling set to NOT_ENABLED will not have it's \"bytesAwaitingCompaction\", \"bytesCompressed\", \"bytesSkipped\", \"segmentCountAwaitingCompaction\", \"segmentCountCompressed\", \"segmentCountSkipped\", \"intervalCountAwaitingCompaction\", \"\r\nintervalCountCompressed\", \"intervalCountSkipped\" update in subsequent auto compaction runs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample response:\r\n{\r\n\"latestSnapshots\":[\r\n {\r\n        \"dataSource\":\"wikipedia\",\r\n        \"scheduleStatus\": \"RUNNING\",\r\n        \"bytesAwaitingCompaction\": 3000,\r\n        \"bytesCompressed\": 5000,\r\n        \"bytesSkipped\": 30,\r\n        \"segmentCountAwaitingCompaction\": 200,\r\n        \"segmentCountCompressed\": 500,\r\n        \"segmentCountSkipped\": 2,\r\n        \"intervalCountAwaitingCompaction\": 30,\r\n        \"intervalCountCompressed\": 50\r\n        \"intervalCountSkipped\": 5,\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDescription of field in response:\r\n     \r\n\r\n- \"dataSource\": name of the datasource for this status information\r\n- \"scheduleStatus\": auto compaction scheduling status: \"NOT_ENABLED\" and \"RUNNING\" w.r.t the dataSource having an auto compaction config submitted to `/druid/coordinator/v1/config/compaction/` or not\r\n- \"bytesAwaitingCompaction\": total byte of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- \"bytesCompressed\":  total byte of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- \"bytesSkipped\":  total byte of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction.\r\n- \"segmentCountAwaitingCompaction\": total number of segments of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- \"segmentCountCompressed\": total number of segments of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- \"segmentCountSkipped\":  total number of segments of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction.\r\n- \"intervalCountAwaitingCompaction\":  total number of intervals of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- \"intervalCountCompressed\": total number of intervals of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- \"intervalCountSkipped\":  total number of intervals of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction.\r\n\r\nDescription of metrics:\r\n\r\nThese are global\r\n- compact/task/count: Number of task issued in this autocompaction run at this time\r\n- compactTask/maxSlot/count: Number of max task slot in this autocompaction run at this time (this is min of ratio * total slot or max compact slot set)\r\n- compactTask/availableSlot/count: Number of available task slot in this autocompaction run at this time (this is max slot minus any currently running compaction task)\r\n\r\nThese are per datasource (datasource is a dimension)\r\n- segment/waitCompact/bytes:  total byte of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- segment/waitCompact/count: total number of segments of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- interval/waitCompact/count: total number of intervals of this datasource waiting to be compacted by the auto compaction (only consider intervals/segments that is eligible for auto compaction)\r\n- segment/compacted/bytes: total byte of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- segment/compacted/count: total number of segments of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- interval/compacted/count: total number of intervals of this datasource that is already compacted with the spec set in the auto compaction.\r\n- segment/skipCompact/bytes:  total byte of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction\r\n- segment/skipCompact/count: total number of segments of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction\r\n- interval/skipCompact/count: total number of intervals of this datasource that is skipped by the auto compaction\r\n\r\nThis PR also fix and improve the emitted metrics for auto-compaction via the CoordinatorStats.\r\n- Emits the above Compacted vs Remaining stats\r\n- Emits details for auto compaction task scheduling. These are tasks scheduled, max compaction slot and available compaction slot during each auto compaction duty run\r\n\r\nConcurrency:\r\nThis PR deals with an existing concurrency issue in CompactSegment class. Updating `totalSizesOfSegmentsAwaitingCompactionPerDataSource` was not thread-safe, but it should be. This applies same to `autoCompactionSnapshotPerDataSource` (`totalSizesOfSegmentsAwaitingCompactionPerDataSource` is replace with `autoCompactionSnapshotPerDataSource` in this PR). The concurrency issue is solved by storing `autoCompactionSnapshotPerDataSource` in an AtomicReference so that we can atomically update the reference to the hash map whenever we compute new snapshots.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis PR adds the ability to compute the output type for a given expression, given the types of the input bindings. It is worth mentioning that _nothing is currently using or taking advantage of this_, and that this PR is scaffolding for follow-up work which will introduce vectorized expressions (and could potentially be used to optimize non-vectorized expressions as well).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the main changes in this PR have been added to `Expr`:\r\n\r\n```java \r\n  @Nullable\r\n  default ExprType getOutputType(InputBindingTypes inputTypes)\r\n  {\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  interface InputBindingTypes\r\n  {\r\n    @Nullable\r\n    ExprType getType(String name);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n \r\nwith similar methods added to `Function` and `ApplyFunction` so that the output types of functions can be computed.\r\n\r\nI think there is a lot of room for further improvement, for example this could potentially be combined with the input analysis, or maybe be transitioned into a sort of `optimize` call that can potentially produce a new `Expr` which already knows its output type, allowing for a `ExprType getOutputType()` with no arguments. Some of the function abstract classes feel a bit messy as well, however, I leave all that as work for another day.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a minor refactor salvaged from #10355 for shorthand of producing long typed boolean values.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

PR adds caching capabilities to queries with join. The support is limited for now and only supported if the right-hand data source in the join is `GlobalTableDataSource`.  But it can be extended to more data sources in follow-up PRs. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe cache key is computed independently of `Joinable` objects. `ServerManager`, `CachingClusteredClient#SpecificQueryRunnable` and `SinkQuerySegmentWalker` use `Joinables.computeDataSourceCacheKey` which then loops through all `PreJoinableClause` objects and \r\n  - builds the cache key for data source participating in clause (1)\r\n    - calls `JoinableFactory.computeJoinCacheKey`. Returns absent if caching is not supported. `BroadcastTableJoinableFactory` returns a key computed using the segment of the broadcast table  \r\n  - adds the `JoinConditionAnalysis` to the above cache key (2)\r\n\r\n(1) - Different data sources can have their own logic on how this caching key is built. `BroadcastTableJoinableFactory` has a single segment and uses this segment's id. `RowBasedIndexedTable` can use the cache key if it's passed externally. E.g. Broker could construct the cache key for inline data sources and pass it to Historicals. Historicals can use this key to construct the cache key. `InlineJoinableFactory` need not even construct the `RowBasedIndexedTable` as it can fetch the cache key directly from `InlineDataSource` if present. That implementation is for some other day though.\r\n\r\n(2) - Apart from the data source on the right, any change in join condition will invalidate the cache as well. `JoinType` and the `original expression` are used to construct the part of the cache key that changes based on the join condition. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #10348 , which is caused by injection failure of storage selector strategy. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, all 4 implementations of `StorageLocationSelectorStrategy` requires a list of `StorageLocation` objects during construction. And `StorageLocation` differs from `StorageLocationConfig` deserialized from configuration file, and the former is instantiated by `SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager`. This also means `StorageLocation` could not be injected into `StorageLocationSelectorStrategy` when they are being constructed.\r\n\r\nIn this PR,\r\n1. the ctor of implementations of `StorageLocationSelectorStrategy` are removed, instead, a setter of storage location method is provided in this interface so that `SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager` could pass the objects to the strategy object\r\n\r\n2. based on the original code, configuration property should be `druid.segmentCache.locationSelectorStrategy.type`, related docs are also updated\r\n\r\n3. some unit test cases are added to check whether these strategy objects are correctly instantiated from configuration properties.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR at the heart creates a useQueryManager hook that lets allows us to convert a bunch of web console components to be functional instead of Component class based. This PR has some user visible changes and a bunch of refactoring work\r\n\r\n#### Big user visible changes\r\n\r\nQuery cancelation in the query view\r\n\r\n![cancel-query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/92290443-efaa3280-eec8-11ea-8456-217be107107e.png)\r\n\r\nBetter error reporting in the query view with link to where the error is in the code\r\n\r\n![query-error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/92511641-72c9d200-f1c2-11ea-92b5-42e9000cee15.png)\r\n\r\nReplace `Auto query` to a smart `Live query` selector with new auto mode (re-run the query if the last one took < 10s)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/92511712-8ffea080-f1c2-11ea-99d3-87565a462a35.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Small user visible changes\r\n\r\n- The annoying tooltip on the `Run` button was removed - it did not work right and would stick open.\r\n- Added more keywords to the SQL highlighter\r\n\r\n#### Internal cleanup\r\n\r\n- Upgraded DruidQueryToolkit to support query cancelation\r\n- Updated `mkcomp` helper to generate shallow snapshot tests by default\r\n- Turn a bunch of components into functional components\r\n- Integrated `QueryState` to represent the state of the query in many components\r\n- Add `HighlightText` component to support the error view highlighting\r\n- Fix typos\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThe size check in LimitedBufferHashGrouper can overflow and hence pass inadvertently. This results in the limited grouper being used when the buffer is too small and so the buffer.limit call within init fails with an IllegalArgumentException. \r\n\r\nThis is likely to only occur at large limits which aren't common but we've seen it occur on our production cluster. The following test added to LimitedBufferHashGrouperTest fails prior to this commit and passes after, I'm not sure it's useful enough to include in the commit itself but included here for anyone

Description\r\nFollow-up to #9638, this PR changes the expression system to operate on `ValueType` instead of `ExprType`. There should be no side-effects from this change, even though `ExprType` was missing `FLOAT` and `COMPLEX`, because  `ExprType` was typically used to control explicitly supported types and otherwise explode. Input types are currently detected from the type of object when resolving identifiers, so there isn't risk of these unhandled types leaking into the expression system. A method `toExpressionType` has been added to convert a `ValueType` into the types which the expression system does understand (float into double, complex into an exception), for the SQL planning layer to use, (this was pushed down from `Expressions` utility class).\r\n\r\nThe only strange-ness introduced in this PR is that when implementing expressions we should ignore these unhandled types, but it seems worth it for having a single type system enum to use in all layers, as well as being able to share the utility methods available on `ValueType`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nNative druid query has `SearchQueryDimFilter` that is faster and supports case-insensitive search. This patch adds the `SearchQueryDimFilter` via two new functions - `contains_str` and `icontains_str` \r\n\r\nI have not chosen `contains`/`icontains` name as the function names since `contains` is a standard operator in calcite similar to `like`. However, in calcite, `contains` [only support periods/date as an input ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-715). To avoid conflicts with `contains` on `strings`, I have chosen different names altogether. \r\n\r\nFrom `org.apache.calcite.sql.SqlKind`\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n   * The \"CONTAINS\" operator for periods.\r\n   */\r\n  CONTAINS,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method name for case insensitive search is different as it is more in line with standard SQL (`like` and `ilike`). The other reason is that we can in the future add more arguments to support extra functionality. E.g. to support [fragment search](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/searchquery.html#fragment), one can do something as follows\r\n\r\n`contains_str(expr, string1, string2, string3,..)`\r\n`icontains_str(expr, string1, string2, string3,..)`\r\n\r\nIt seems cleaner to carve out a different function for case insensitive search so that the method signature is cleaner and easier to understand. \r\n\r\nI didn't add the support for multi-string input right away as I could not find a way to specify a type checker as follows \r\n ```\r\n.operandTypeChecker(OperandTypes.sequence(\"expr, string\", OperandTypes.repeat(\r\n            SqlOperandCountRanges.from(1),\r\n            OperandTypes.and(OperandTypes.LITERAL, OperandTypes.STRING)\r\n        )))\r\n```\r\nAbove is not a valid syntax as `OperandTypes.sequence` takes `SqlSingleOperandTypeChecker` as input while `OperandTypes.repeat` returns `CompositeOperandTypeChecker`. \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
