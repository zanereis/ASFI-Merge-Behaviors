API is still using the outdated initialization method for `GraphModule`, which has led to issues where the old API no longer works as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Java API for `GraphModule` initialization to match the simplified method used in the Python API.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nIn the Python API, `GraphModule` can be initialized in a more concise way:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ngm = graph_executor.GraphModule(lib[\"default\"](dev))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the Java API still uses the older approach:\r\n```python\r\ngm = graph_executor.create(graph_json, lib, dev);\r\ngm.load_params(params);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe old API is not only more verbose (two additional files need to be saved and loaded), but also appears to no longer be functional as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere is an example of deploying [DepthAnything](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2) where the ONNX frontend of Relay is used to create the IRModule before compiling and exporting. During deployment, the old initialization method seems no longer works (top: new method, bottom: old method): \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1185\" alt=\"截屏2024-10-14 16 38 57\"

API, aligning it with the simplified Python API.\r\n\r\n# Usage Example\r\n\r\nJava: \r\n```java\r\nDevice dev = Device.cpu();\r\nModule lib = Module.load(libPath);\r\nModule mod = lib.getFunction(\"default\").call(dev).asModule();  // The current Java API does not support calling Device types in Functions\r\nGraphModule gm = new GraphModule(mod, cpuDev);\r\n```\r\n\r\nequivalent Python:\r\n```python\r\ndev = tvm.device('cpu')\r\nlib = tvm.runtime.load_module(libPath)\r\ngm =

pass `LowerThreadAllreduce` enables efficient block reduction. However, block reduction often requires a large amount of shared memory space. The current implementation of `LowerThreadAllreduce` only enable static shared memory reduce buffer allocation and prevents the shared memory merging when another shared memory scope is defined as `shared.dyn`.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nA_shared: \"shared.dyn\"\r\nB_shared: \"shared.dyn\"\r\nC_shared: \"shared.dyn\"\r\nred: \"shared\" (can not be merged into the union shared memory

not padded by PadEinsum\r\n\r\n`TileWithTensorIntrin` in `src/tir/schedule/transform.cc` calls `PadEinsum` and inlines the padded input (output) to its original producer (consumer). However it is possible that one of the inputs/outputs does not need to be padded, in which case that producer (consumer) is not padded by `PadEinsum`. This means that `TileWithTensorIntrin` may inline blocks that are irrelevant to padding and must not be inlined.\r\n\r\nThis has led to multiple bug reports and (temporary) fixes as in #17171, #16614, #16239 and #15505. Unfortunately #16239 and #17171 can only prevent TVM from crashing when the padded buffer is an input/output buffer, and still some incorrect inlining may be performed. The [workaround](https://github.com/nautasolva/tvm/commit/4e0191e3e303daa62edb8050df444d6b99df1048) in #15505 tried to handle this bug by extra checking in the `MultiLevelTilingTensorCore` rule, which is logically incorrect. This PR aims to provide a one-and-for-all fix for this.\r\n\r\nCredit to @XFPlus for the bug reproduce example in #16239.","created_at":"2024-10-04T18:56:15Z","updated_at":"2024-10-05T07:32:32Z","closed_at":"2024-10-05T07:32:31Z","merged_at":"2024-10-05T07:32:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"accd582d3a006b6c3473187e1c155fa535343d8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b46a0927fb69a706c15551de42c2370a5785013c","head":{"label":"Yongqi-Zhuo:main","ref":"main","sha":"b46a0927fb69a706c15551de42c2370a5785013c","user":{"login":"Yongqi-Zhuo","id":22978992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTc4OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22978992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/Yongqi-Zhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":697240782,"node_id":"R_kgDOKY8Mzg","name":"tvm","full_name":"Yongqi-Zhuo/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yongqi-Zhuo","id":22978992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTc4OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22978992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/Yongqi-Zhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yongqi-Zhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yongqi-Zhuo/tvm","description":"Open

discussed in issue #17375, the current rule for assigning touched buffers is not appropriate. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncode_block_0\r\nfor k in range(0, 10): # (the gen point of A_shared and B_shared will be injected into this for expression)\r\n    for i in range(0, 10):\r\n          A_shared <- A\r\n    for i in range(0, 10):\r\n          B_shared <- B\r\n    code_block_1 (consume A_shared and B_shared)\r\ncode_block_2 (produce and consume C_shared)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis setup works by chance in simple GEMM scenarios. However, the correct approach should be\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncode_block_0\r\nfor k in range(0, 10): \r\n    for i in range(0, 10):\r\n          A_shared <- A # (the gen point of A_shared should be bind into this BufferStore Node)\r\n    for i in range(0, 10):\r\n          B_shared <- B # (the gen point of B_shared be bind into this BufferStore Node)\r\n    code_block_1 (consume A_shared and B_shared)\r\ncode_block_2 (produce and consume C_shared)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach works correctly even in more complex scenarios, such as batched GEMM, where the naive template would fail.\r\n\r\nThis pull request made a simple modification for `MergeSharedMemory` Pass to enable the right analysis, and always disable the naive naive shared memory buffer fuse if kernel with dynamic in `StorageRewrite` Pass","created_at":"2024-10-04T16:44:28Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T17:16:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b2f7791e69a38086f8c1464f0dd1a671c794bca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"spectrometerHBH","id":32121147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32121147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH","html_url":"https://github.com/spectrometerHBH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e4d3bdd2566d2c6c4f0d72140425949c759f47a1","head":{"label":"LeiWang1999:fix-liveness","ref":"fix-liveness","sha":"e4d3bdd2566d2c6c4f0d72140425949c759f47a1","user":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":615660601,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLI8OQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"LeiWang1999/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999/tvm","description":"Open

Overview\r\nThis PR introduces a new TIR schedule primitive **annotate_buffer_access** that allows explicit annotation of buffer access regions for both reads and writes. \r\n### Motivation\r\nTVM currently does not support inferring the numerical range of floating-point calculations. As a result, buffer access regions involving floating-point calculations cannot be accurately inferred and default to the full extent of the buffer. This new primitive addresses this limitation by allowing manual specification of access regions.\r\n### Usage scenarios\r\nThis primitive is particularly useful for operations where the default buffer region inference may not capture the precise access patterns, such as in resize operations. It overrides the automatically inferred region for the specified buffer.\r\n### Example\r\n#### Trivial Example\r\nbefore:\r\n```python\r\n   @T.prim_func\r\n    def before(x: T.Buffer((1, 1, 32, 32), \"float16\"), resize: T.Buffer((1, 1, 16, 16), \"float16\")):\r\n        for i0, i1, i2, i3 in T.grid(1, 1, 16, 16):\r\n            with T.block(\"resize\"):\r\n                v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0, i1, i2, i3])\r\n                T.reads(x[v_i0, v_i1, 0:32, 0:32])\r\n                T.writes(resize[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n                resize[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = T.Cast(\"float16\", T.Cast(\"float32\", x[v_i0, v_i1, T.max(T.min(T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor((T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i2) + T.float32(0.5)) * T.float32(2) - T.float32(0.5) + T.float32(1.0000000000000001e-05))), 31), 0), T.max(T.min(T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor((T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i3) + T.float32(0.5)) * T.float32(2) - T.float32(0.5) + T.float32(1.0000000000000001e-05))), 31), 0)]))\r\n```\r\nPerform annotate_buffer_access:\r\n```python     \r\n    sch.annotate_buffer_access(block, 0, \"read\",\r\n        gen_new_ranges=lambda v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3: [\r\n            v_i0,\r\n            v_i1,\r\n            (v_i2 * 2 - 3, v_i2 * 2 + 3),\r\n            (v_i3 * 2 - 3, v_i3 * 2 + 3),\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```python\r\n     @T.prim_func\r\n    def after(x: T.Buffer((1, 1, 32, 32), \"float16\"), resize: T.Buffer((1, 1, 16, 16), \"float16\")):\r\n        for i0, i1, i2, i3 in T.grid(1, 1, 16, 16):\r\n            with T.block(\"resize\"):\r\n                v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0, i1, i2, i3])\r\n                T.reads(x[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2 * 2 - 3:v_i2 * 2 + 3, v_i3 * 2 - 3:v_i3 * 2 + 3])\r\n                T.writes(resize[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n                T.block_attr({\"explicit_read_region\": [0]})\r\n                resize[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = T.Cast(\"float16\", T.Cast(\"float32\", x[v_i0, v_i1, T.max(T.min(T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor((T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i2) + T.float32(0.5)) * T.float32(2) - T.float32(0.5) + T.float32(1.0000000000000001e-05))), 31), 0), T.max(T.min(T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor((T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i3) + T.float32(0.5)) * T.float32(2) - T.float32(0.5) + T.float32(1.0000000000000001e-05))), 31), 0)]))\r\n```\r\nThe primitive adds an annotation(`T.block_attr({\"explicit_read_region\": [0]})`) to the block, indicating that an explicit region has been provided for the buffer at the given index. This annotation is used in the CompactBufferAllocation pass to respect the manually specified region instead of relying on automatic inference.\r\n\r\n#### Resize Op Tile Example\r\nWe can optimize the tiling of the \"cache\" block for the \"resize\" operation using the annotate_buffer_access primitive.\r\nbefore:\r\n```python\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def before(x: T.Buffer((1, 3, 200, 200), \"float32\"), y: T.Buffer((1, 3, 100, 100), \"float32\")):\r\n        x_global = T.alloc_buffer([1, 3, 200, 200], dtype=\"float32\")\r\n        for ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3 in T.grid(1, 3, 200, 200):\r\n            with T.block(\"cache\"):\r\n                v0, v1, v2, v3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3])\r\n                x_global[v0, v1, v2, v3] = x[v0, v1, v2, v3]\r\n        for i0, i1, i2, i3 in T.grid(1, 3, 100, 100):\r\n            with T.block(\"resize\"):\r\n                v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSSS\", [i0, i1, i2, i3])\r\n                y[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = x_global[v_i0, v_i1, T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(v_i2 * 2 + 0.5)), T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(v_i3 * 2 + 0.5))]\r\n```\r\nLet's split the i2 loop and i3 loop of the \"resize\" block, and then compute-at \"cache\" block to outer loop of resize. This is a typical schedule of tile process. \r\n```python\r\n    h, w = s.get_loops(resize_block)[-2:]\r\n    ho, hi = s.split(h, factors=[10, 10])\r\n    wo, wi = s.split(w, factors=[10, 10])\r\n    s.reorder(ho, wo, hi, wi)\r\n    s.compute_at(cache_block, wo)\r\n```\r\nAfter tiling without annotate_buffer_access:\r\n```python\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def after_without_annotate_buffer_access(x: T.Buffer((1, 3, 200, 200), \"float32\"), y: T.Buffer((1, 3, 100, 100), \"float32\")):\r\n        x_global = T.alloc_buffer((1, 3, 200, 200))\r\n        for i0, i1, i2_0, i3_0 in T.grid(1, 3, 10, 10):\r\n            for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(200, 200):\r\n                with T.block(\"cache\"):\r\n                    v0 = T.axis.spatial(1, 0)\r\n                    v1, v2, v3 = T.axis.remap(\"SSS\", [i1, ax0, ax1])\r\n                    T.reads(x[v0, v1, v2, v3])\r\n                    T.writes(x_global[v0, v1, v2, v3])\r\n                    x_global[v0, v1, v2, v3] = x[v0, v1, v2, v3]\r\n            for i2_1, i3_1 in T.grid(10, 10):\r\n                with T.block(\"resize\"):\r\n                    v_i0, v_i1 = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i0, i1])\r\n                    v_i2 = T.axis.spatial(100, i2_0 * 10 + i2_1)\r\n                    v_i3 = T.axis.spatial(100, i3_0 * 10 + i3_1)\r\n                    T.reads(x_global[v_i0, v_i1, 0:200, 0:200])\r\n                    T.writes(y[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n                    y[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = x_global[v_i0, v_i1, T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i2 * 2) + T.float32(0.5))), T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i3 * 2) + T.float32(0.5)))]\r\n```\r\nNotice that the \"cache\" block still reads the entire 200x200 region after compute-at. To optimize this, we can use annotate_buffer_access to explicitly annotate the buffer region of the \"resize\" block:\r\n```python\r\n    s.annotate_buffer_access(\r\n        resize_block,\r\n        0,\r\n        \"read\",\r\n        lambda vn, vc, vh, vw: (vn, vc, (vh * 2 - 3, vh * 2 + 3), (vw * 2 - 3, vw * 2 + 3)),\r\n    )\r\n    s.compute_at(cache_block, wo)\r\n```\r\nAfter tiling with annotate_buffer_access:\r\n```python\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def after_with_annotate_buffer_access(x: T.Buffer((1, 3, 200, 200), \"float32\"), y: T.Buffer((1, 3, 100, 100), \"float32\")):\r\n        x_global = T.alloc_buffer((1, 3, 200, 200))\r\n        for i0, i1, i2_0, i3_0 in T.grid(1, 3, 10, 10):\r\n            for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(24, 24):\r\n                with T.block(\"cache\"):\r\n                    v0 = T.axis.spatial(1, 0)\r\n                    v1 = T.axis.spatial(3, i1)\r\n                    v2 = T.axis.spatial(200, i2_0 * 20 - 3 + ax0)\r\n                    v3 = T.axis.spatial(200, i3_0 * 20 - 3 + ax1)\r\n                    T.where(3 <= i2_0 * 20 + ax0 and i2_0 * 20 + ax0 < 203 and 3 <= i3_0 * 20 + ax1 and i3_0 * 20 + ax1 < 203)\r\n                    T.reads(x[v0, v1, v2, v3])\r\n                    T.writes(x_global[v0, v1, v2, v3])\r\n                    x_global[v0, v1, v2, v3] = x[v0, v1, v2, v3]\r\n            for i2_1, i3_1 in T.grid(10, 10):\r\n                with T.block(\"resize\"):\r\n                    v_i0, v_i1 = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i0, i1])\r\n                    v_i2 = T.axis.spatial(100, i2_0 * 10 + i2_1)\r\n                    v_i3 = T.axis.spatial(100, i3_0 * 10 + i3_1)\r\n                    T.reads(x_global[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2 * 2 - 3:v_i2 * 2 - 3 + 6, v_i3 * 2 - 3:v_i3 * 2 - 3 + 6])\r\n                    T.writes(y[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n                    T.block_attr({\"explicit_read_region\": [0]})\r\n                    y[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = x_global[v_i0, v_i1, T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i2 * 2) + T.float32(0.5))), T.Cast(\"int32\", T.floor(T.Cast(\"float32\", v_i3 * 2) + T.float32(0.5)))]\r\n```\r\nThe \"cache\" block now only reads the necessary 24x24 region instead of the entire 200x200 input. These optimizations significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve cache efficiency, especially for larger input sizes.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nCaution should be exercised when using this function, as incorrect annotations may lead to incorrect code generation or runtime errors.

WebGPU API `requestAdapterInfo()` was deprecated as described here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUAdapter/requestAdapterInfo#browser_compatibility. This caused `npm run build` under `web/` to cause error since it cannot find `requestAdapterInfo`, hence the PR: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/17371\r\n\r\nHowever, downstream users may still have older browser version and would still rely on `requestAdapterInfo()`, see https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/issues/572 for an example.\r\n\r\nThis PR casts `adapter` to `any` type when calling `requestAdapterInfo()`, so it does not complain about not being able to find `requestAdapterInfo()` during compile time, hence no issue should be observed during runtime on older browsers, achieving backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nBump TVMjs version from `0.18.0-dev0` to `0.18.0-dev2` (skipped dev1 due to a

PR adds a check for If nodes for ONNX frontend of Relay to skip the broadcast if the predicate is constant.\r\nSometimes PyTorch to ONNX inserts silly if nodes that produce dynamic ranks, and ONNX frontend of TVM would broadcast the lower dimensions between branches, which is irrational for some cases, e.g. `5×5×3×4` to `5×5×3×4×1`. The predicate of silly if might be constant and reasonable to skip to avoid the broadcast problem.\r\nThis issue was captured in #16898 and #17050.","created_at":"2024-09-18T08:15:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T03:12:28Z","closed_at":"2024-09-22T06:55:45Z","merged_at":"2024-09-22T06:55:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"72d542e71c628bc3d6bd983c2cd753a663b521a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/125683cbc36be5536ece4dd89576298e40dfcc53","head":{"label":"xhmelon:fix-onnx-if","ref":"fix-onnx-if","sha":"125683cbc36be5536ece4dd89576298e40dfcc53","user":{"login":"xhmelon","id":7871151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzExNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7871151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon","html_url":"https://github.com/xhmelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629338473,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYLxaQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"xhmelon/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xhmelon","id":7871151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzExNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7871151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon","html_url":"https://github.com/xhmelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xhmelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xhmelon/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, after the `DiagnosticContext` prints its error, it overwrites the `DiagnosticRenderer` with a NULL renderer.  If a second call to `DiagnosticContext::Render` occurs, it will segfault. This appears to be intended to prevent double-printing of error messages, but double-printing error messages is much worse than a segfault.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `DiagnosticContext::Render` should only be called once. There's a common pattern in the parser where it will wrap exceptions in `DiagnosticError`, but re-raise exceptions that are already a `DiagnosticError`.  This requires every such location to include `except DiagnosticError: raise`, and can easily be missed.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes two changes: First, the `DiagnosticRenderer` is updated to have a no-op callback rather than a NULL callback.  Second, the re-raising of `DiagnosticError` is moved to `Parser.report_error`, so that it does not need to be handled separately at several independent locations in the TVMScript parser.","created_at":"2024-09-13T14:46:04Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T14:30:37Z","closed_at":"2024-09-17T14:07:41Z","merged_at":"2024-09-17T14:07:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff8e41644fde86714d6dbf021d57baebe3a1ec1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6bd7c741be1172d1a89a4d32cfa30134c4b9530a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_avoid_segfault_from_incorrect_tensor_annotation","ref":"relax_avoid_segfault_from_incorrect_tensor_annotation","sha":"6bd7c741be1172d1a89a4d32cfa30134c4b9530a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
