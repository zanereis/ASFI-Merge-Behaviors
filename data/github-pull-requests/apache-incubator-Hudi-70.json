What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdding tests to Metadata table based on HoodieTestTable. Objective is to make the tests lean and consistent. Especially contents of data files does not matter for metadata, we have an opportunity to make it simpler. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added few building blocks to HoodieTestTable to assist in this testing. Especially metadata sync relies on commitMetadata and hence all such supporting blocks are added to HoodieTestTable. \r\n- Added tests covering bootstrap, regular writes, clean, compaction, rollback, inflight operation mid timeline, etc. \r\n- Tests based on HoodieTestTable tests just the metadata table and hence sync has to be called explicitly simulating actual sequence of sync calls. So, for now, leaving existing tests in TestHoodieBackedMetadata as is. Will think through more on this and come up with a strategy on how to cover those by tests.  \r\n- As of now, focussed on COW. Yet to add log files related tests to MOR. \r\n- Will be adding more tests to TestHoodieBackedMetadata in the next few days. And eventual goal is to remove all SparkRddWriteClient based tests for metadata. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nChange itself is just around tests. \r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to TestHoodieBackedMetadata*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nImplement Kafka Sink Protocol for Hudi for Ingesting Immutable Data. This PR enables connect users to readily ingest Kafka AVRO/ JSON string records into Hudi tables without Spark engine, within the Kafka Connect framework.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use the HoodieJavaWriteClient's bulk insert support to insert append only data (CoW). We use file id indexing to ensure multiple writers per Kafka partition can write to the same Hudi partition path concurrently without locks. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. The Kafka connect protocol is implemented in a new package, hudi-kafka-connect\r\n2. A few code changes to integrate support for bulk insert with HoodieJavaWriteClient. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n1.

Rebased with latest master and squashed commits. \r\n- This patch adds synchronous updates to metadata table. In other words, every write is first committed to metadata table followed by data table. While reading metadata table, we ignore any delta commits that are present only in metadata table and not in data table timeline. \r\n- Compaction of metadata table is fenced by the condition that we trigger compaction only when there are no inflight requests in datatable. This ensures that all base files in metadata table is always in sync with data table(w/o any holes) and only there could be some extra invalid commits among delta log files in metadata table. \r\n- Due to this, archival of data table also fences itself up until compacted instant in metadata table. \r\n- All writes to metadata table happens within the datatable lock. So, metadata table works in one writer mode only. This might be tough to loosen since all writers write to same FILES partition and so, will result in a conflict anyways. \r\n- As part of this, I have added acquiring locks in data table for those operations which were not before while committing (rollback, clean, compaction, cluster). Remember we are not doing any conflict resolution. All we are doing here is to commit by taking a lock. So that all writes to metadata table is always a single writer. Note: In the original [patch](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3426), a new transaction manager and lock was introduce for Metadata writer layer, but that complicates things and involves taking a lock within another lock which could result in a deadlock if not handled well. So, we are simplifying it and just leveraging the single data table lock. \r\n- Also added building block to add buckets for partitions, which will be leveraged by other indexes like record level index, etc. For now, FILES partition has only one bucket.  In general, max of 9999 buckets per partition is allowed and each partition has a fixed fileId prefix with incremental suffix for each bucket within each partition.  \r\n- Have fixed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2476. This is about retrying a failed compaction if it succeeded in metadata for first time, but failed w/ data table. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - All tests in TestHoodieBackedMetadata is rewritten (in one of previous patch) using testTable infra. \r\n  - Metadata is enabled by default. Fixed tests that were failing. Some tests are not easy to fix due to the way its written (manually creates or deletes meta files, test table etc). Have filed a follow up task [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2472) to fix them. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes Hudi website Download page in accordance with ASF requirements. The jira has the email from moderator of **announce@apache.org** which suggests the changes.\r\n\r\n- Added `Verify Release` section on the downloads page. For this I referred to other recent announcements for https://tika.apache.org/download.html and https://apisix.apache.org/downloads/\r\n- The `Verify Release` section has link to the `KEYS`\r\n- Removed the download links from individual release pages, as then they might raise concerns that `Verify Release` information is not present in each and every release page along with the download information.\r\n- Since I removed the download links from individual release pages, it also resolves the concern raised that the source release is not linked to the mirror but instead to https://downloads.apache.org/\r\n- The source release on the Downloads page already links to the mirror, so it should be fine.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter  https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3310 merged, replaced data file is cleaned in cleaner service. But if replacecommit file deleted by archival, cleaner service can not delete the replaced data file anymore.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nJust change the execution order between cleaner and archival services.\r\n\r\n           -> cleaner service starts first then archival service works.\r\n\r\nFor sync clean, we trigger clean first.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2359\r\n\r\nIn issue thread https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3321, there was a discussion around the functionality of `hoodie_is_deleted` field.\r\n\r\n1. We wanted to ensure that when this field was being set to `true`, that the specified record would be deleted.\r\n2. We also wanted to make sure that this field only needed to be set to `true` for an incoming record, and not for existing records.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to add unit tests that follow similar reproductions as discussed in the above github issue thread.\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan example https://gist.github.com/nsivabalan/e5ac69677ed05e9f2749fae67d3abc19 \r\n@nmukerje example

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2359\r\n\r\nIn issue thread https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3321, there was a discussion around the functionality of `hoodie_is_deleted` field.\r\n\r\n1. We wanted to ensure that when this field was being set to `true`, that the specified record would be deleted.\r\n2. We also wanted to make sure that this field only needed to be set to `true` for an incoming record, and not for existing records.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to add unit tests that follow similar reproductions as discussed in the above github issue thread.\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan example https://gist.github.com/nsivabalan/e5ac69677ed05e9f2749fae67d3abc19 \r\n@nmukerje example

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2359\r\n\r\nIn issue thread https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3321, there was a discussion around the functionality of `hoodie_is_deleted` field.\r\n\r\n1. We wanted to ensure that when this field was being set to `true`, that the specified record would be deleted.\r\n2. We also wanted to make sure that this field only needed to be set to `true` for an incoming record, and not for existing records.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to add unit tests that follow similar reproductions as discussed in the above github issue thread.\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan example https://gist.github.com/nsivabalan/e5ac69677ed05e9f2749fae67d3abc19 \r\n@nmukerje example https://github.com/nmukerje/misc/blob/master/Hudi/Hudi_Pyspark_Delete_Upsert_Test.ipynb\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added test methods to existing test classes and can be verified as follows:\r\n```\r\nmvn -Dtest=TestMORDataSource#testHoodieIsDeletedMOR test -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark/\r\n\r\nmvn

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the common FS and IO util methods used by marker-related operations. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds new methods in `FSUtils` and `FileIOUtils`\r\n  - `parallelizeSubPathProcess()`: a general method for going through sub paths in parallel using `HoodieEngineContext` with custom predicates and processing logic for each sub path.\r\n  - `deleteDir()`: delete a directory with parallelism\r\n  - `readAsUTFStringLines()`: read file content into lines\r\n- Uses the above methods in marker mechanisms wherever possible.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Unit tests around `WriteMarkers` succeed\r\n- Manually runs spark jobs of bulk inserts with `direct` and `timeline-server-based` marker types.  Both of them succeed locally.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nHudi now support async clustering in HoodieDeltaStreamer and StructStreaming and support offline clustering through HoodieClusteringJob.\r\n\r\nData update conflicts with clustering is one of the more common scenarios. And now hudi can only reject data using SparkRejectUpdateStrategy and failed the ingestion.\r\n\r\nSometimes, we think that clustering is an optimization service that runs in the background, and data ingestion has a higher priority than it.\r\n\r\nSo this tickets add a new UpdateStrategy named `SparkRejectClusteringStrategy`.\r\n\r\nThis SparkRejectClusteringStrategy will reject and failing clustering job and let data update success. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nWhen update happened after clustering plan created and before clustering executed.\r\n\r\n     1. There will be a request replace commit.  \r\n\r\n     2. SparkRejectClusteringStrategy will create a clustering reject file under .tmp dir named xxx.replacement.request.reject.\r\n\r\n     3. Before perform clustering job, hudi can check this reject file using SparkRejectClusteringStrategy.validateClustering() function.\r\n\r\n          3.1 if reject file is exists then abort this clustering plan and remove reject file.\r\n\r\nWhen update happened after clustering executed but not finished.\r\n\r\n     1. There will be a inflight replace commit.\r\n\r\n     2. SparkRejectClusteringStrategy will create a clustering reject file under .tmp dir named xxx.replacement.inflight.reject.\r\n\r\n     3. Before clustering job finished and committed, hudi can check this reject file using SparkRejectClusteringStrategy.validateClustering() function.\r\n\r\n          3.1 if reject file is exists then failed this clustering execution and remove reject file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is already tested on our env and added UTs which are necessary.\r\nAs you can see, the update action in 20210820093028.commit can success and create a clustering reject file under .hoodie/.tmp dir\r\nAlso the clustering job in 20210820092927.replacecommit.requested if failed because of SparkRejectClusteringStrategy\r\n<img width=\"452\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2021-08-20 上午10 05 14\"
