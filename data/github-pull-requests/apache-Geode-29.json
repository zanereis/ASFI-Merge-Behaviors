found and fixed the issues causing memcached IntegrationJUnitTest to fail. Please re-review and hopefully it should pass all precheckin jobs this time.\r\n\r\nI hate creating a special package-private method just for the test BUT I can't think of an effective test without getting some sort of state from GemFireCacheImpl that identifies which call or which thread actually performed the close.\r\n\r\nWithout identifying which call or thread performed the close, the test devolves to just asserting that two threads can call close but it can't really assert which call did the actual work of closing GemFireCacheImpl. From a really high level, we don't really care. But at a low level, we don't want the 2nd callers to return before the 1st caller has finished the close (doesn't matter if the 1st caller returns from close() after 2nd callers though which is what causes the flakiness).","created_at":"2020-05-04T16:30:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T22:16:55Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T22:16:51Z","merged_at":"2020-05-06T22:16:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e957f1db7760aa2bdc767c9c469e926cd490cad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gesterzhou","id":10713950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEzOTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10713950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/gesterzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lgallinat","id":11180732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwNzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11180732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat","html_url":"https://github.com/lgallinat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/42583c79341691c0e747d7806653ad89f42d6f66","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-8060-GemFireCacheImplCloseTest-fix","ref":"GEODE-8060-GemFireCacheImplCloseTest-fix","sha":"42583c79341691c0e747d7806653ad89f42d6f66","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","

are unit tests that are better off renamed and moved to src/integrationTest because they touch several Geode classes including singletons:\r\n* geode-core/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/distributed/internal/InternalLocatorTest.java\r\n* geode-core/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/distributed/internal/locks/DLockServiceJUnitTest.java\r\n\r\nThis one creates a full DistributedSystem stack so it belongs in src/integrationTest:\r\n* geode-core/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/distributed/internal/InternalDistributedSystemTest.java\r\n\r\nAnd these unit tests create a full Cache stack so they belong in src/integrationTest:\r\n* geode-lucene/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/cache/lucene/FlatFormatPdxSerializerJunitTest.java\r\n* geode-protobuf/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/internal/protocol/protobuf/v1/serialization/codec/JsonPdxConverterJUnitTest.java\r\n\r\nAnd one last unit test that I was able to fix -- this test creates a spy to test as a partial mock with a common goof that results in a full Cache being created and then not used by the test:\r\n* extensions/geode-modules/src/test/java/org/apache/geode/modules/util/BootstrappingFunctionTest.java\r\n\r\n@jdeppe-pivotal please review

maven to fetch org.apache.geode:geode-core:1.12.0-SNAPSHOT currently returns an artifact from Feb 5 -- the last day develop was 1.12.  Now that we have long-lived support branches, we should continue publishing to the snapshot repo from those support branches as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the release scripts to not remove -SNAPSHOT when cutting a support branch\r\nand changes the conditionals in the pipeline jinja template to keep the PublishArtifacts job on support branches.\r\n\r\nThe general concept for support branches is:\r\nbefore: we dropped the -SNAPSHOT at time of branch creation\r\nnow: we will keep -SNAPSHOT at branch creation, drop it only when preparing an RC, and then re-add it as soon as the RC has been tagged (and keep it at all times on the support pipeline)\r\n\r\nThe changes have been applied to support/1.12 and a 1.12.1-SNAPSHOT was successfully published (finally turning [examples](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/apache-support-1-12-examples/jobs/TestExamples/builds/10) green)\r\n\r\nAlso updates copyright year at branch creation and RC
