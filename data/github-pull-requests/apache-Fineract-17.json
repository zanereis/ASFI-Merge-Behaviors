(default)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is loaded/instantiated via a factory class \"LoanRepaymentScheduleTransactionProcessor\" and it's only method \"determineProcessor\" by passing a \"LoanTransactionProcessingStrategy\" object. \"LoanTransactionProcessingStrategy\" is effectively treated like an enum (only its \"code\" attribute is used). The other attributes \"LoanTransactionProcessingStrategy\" seem to be only for display purposes in a UI.\r\n\r\nProposed improvements:\r\n\r\n- remove hardcoded instantiations of processors\r\n- remove \"LoanTransactionProcessingStrategy\" and avoid storing this information in the database (table \"ref_loan_transaction_processing_strategy\") in the first place. This would also remove some unnecessary constraints/joins to this table.\r\n- use dependency injection to make loan transaction processing customizable\r\n- provide possibility to list all available

Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>liquibase/liquibase</summary>\n\n### [`v4.17.0`](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/tag/v4.17.0)\n\nLiquibase v4.17.0\n\n#### Notable Changes\n\n-   \\[PRO] The `liquibase flow` command and flow files are available with a Pro license. It allows you to create portable, platform-independent  workflows that can run across different tools without modifying each workflow.\n    -   Learn more about flow here: [liquibase flow file and command](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/flow/flow.html)\n    -   If you want to provide feedback or have questions, please visit the forum at https://forum.liquibase.org/\n\n-   \\[PRO] Pro license users can now integrate Amazon S3 with Liquibase. You can extend Liquibase to use remote file locations to enable secure, centralized file management.\n    -   Learn more here: [S3 Remote Files](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/remote-files/s3.html)\n\n-   \\[PRO] Pro license users can use searchpath to find files located on S3 that cannot be found by an absolute path.\n    -   Learn more about the [Searchpath command here](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/how-liquibase-finds-files.html).\n    -   Learn more about [Searchpath with S3 here](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/remote-files/searchpath.html).\n\n#### API Breaking Changes\n\n-   The liquibase.resource.ResourceAccessor APIs were updated to take advantage of the new liquibase.resource.Resource abstraction that was introduced. Code that USES the existing ResourceAccessor methods will continue to work as before with no changes, but if you have written custom implementations of ResourceAccessor there are new and changed methods to implement. For more information, see [javadocs.liquibase.com](https://javadocs.liquibase.com)\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n-   Created new liquibase.resource.Resource interface by

your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [ ] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/legacy-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Submission is not a \"code dump\".  (Large changes can be made \"in repository\" via a branch.

custom code/modules was still not sufficiently explained. We have currently 2 different examples concerning modules and how to add your own code to Fineract while ensuring at the same time that downstream syncs work without a hassle. In the current upstream code there are still too many files that need to be changed when a custom module is added (e. g. settings.gradle etc.).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to make adding extensions/customizations to Fineract as easy as possible:\r\n\r\n- no file edits on upstream related files\r\n- avoid clashes with Fineract internals\r\n- avoid clashes with other companies' extensions\r\n- provide a custom Fineract Docker image that automatically includes all custom modules\r\n- give examples and best practices (replace note service, add a COB business step)\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T18:43:11Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T16:57:41Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T16:57:36Z","merged_at":"2022-10-14T16:57:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba765f9b7a398306959aae00571dba6c041ce7c7","assignee":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/pulls/2669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/pulls/2669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/statuses/e40897269bdd1188a2f78fdb14688ccb2dc5affc","head":{"label":"vidakovic:feature/FINERACT-1758","ref":"feature/FINERACT-1758","sha":"e40897269bdd1188a2f78fdb14688ccb2dc5affc","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196317722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTYzMTc3MjI=","name":"fineract","full_name":"vidakovic/fineract","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic/fineract","description":"Apache

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls.

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls.

Description\r\nChanges for introducing event categorization for business events.\r\nEvents are categorized based on domain objects on which events occur.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nThere might be downstream consumers who are interested in all - for example - Loan related events but they don’t want to specify it down to fine-grained level events like Loan Approval, Loan Disbursement.\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\nIntroduced category column for events table.\r\nFor each event type category must be provided.\r\nExternal Events are saved with category information.\r\n\r\nDescribe the changes made and why they were made.\r\n\r\nIgnore if these details are present on the associated [Apache Fineract JIRA ticket](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1284).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make

When a new version of Java is released, it can be added to this file and be used without releasing new version of the action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Related pull request: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-java/pull/383\">actions/setup-java#383</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-java/commit/a18c333f3f14249953dab3e186e5e21bf3390f1d\"><code>a18c333</code></a> Add versions-manifest.json for Microsoft Build of OpenJDK (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-java/issues/383\">#383</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-java/commit/26eeac8c9ecbde54412d05d158756b4897c3a9b9\"><code>26eeac8</code></a> Add json for Microsoft Build of OpenJDK (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-java/issues/386\">#386</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-java/commit/a96c2ca6ae7c46a627e7df3989a615ad926b1189\"><code>a96c2ca</code></a> improve documentation and more emphasis to Java 17 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-java/issues/379\">#379</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-java/commit/7bbeb80d2449ed6780428f731facb4cb4154c65f\"><code>7bbeb80</code></a> Fix typo (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-java/issues/380\">#380</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-java/compare/d854b6da19cdadd9a010605529e522c2393ebd38...a18c333f3f14249953dab3e186e5e21bf3390f1d\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=actions/setup-java&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=3.5.0&new-version=3.5.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
