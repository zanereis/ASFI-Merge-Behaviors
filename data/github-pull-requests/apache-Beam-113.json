However, it would be nice if some of the ping limits are relaxed a bit. [Currently](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/keepalive.md), the gRPC server has fairly strict limits:\r\n```\r\nGRPC_ARG_HTTP2_MAX_PINGS_WITHOUT_DATA = 2\r\nGRPC_ARG_HTTP2_MAX_PING_STRIKES = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy PR removes these 2 limits completely wherever `grpc.server()` is invoked (Python SDK only). I'm not sure this is the best approach, but I'm happy to adjust it based on your feedback.\r\n\r\nBonus request: it would be even nicer if Beam could allow passing options to the gRPC client & server via some flags.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Go SDK doesn't have a PipelineOptions struct, however it can be useful to have these populated from flags for display in UIs and similar.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses set flags to populate the pipeline options, for display in the Dataflow UI. This filters out Dataflow known flags that aren't relevant for job execution/display purposes. It also provides a method `DontUseFlagAsPipelineOption` for a user to filter out flags they don't wish displayed, such as for credentials or noisy/repetitive data.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

exceptions such as timeouts or unavailable for a single file would not be caught\r\nand would cause retries and backoff of the entire DoFn processing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally plumb the options to ignore missing sources through to underlying FileSystem.rename\r\nso that file systems can handle such errors intelligently per-file.  The filtering in FileSystems.rename\r\nto remove such files is beneficial because it may use cheaper match operations but it is insufficient\r\nas previous deletes observed as timeouts may delete files between the match and rename.\r\n\r\nFurther reduce operations by modifying FileBasedSink to not delete files that have been renamed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current design of ReadFileRangesFn continually throws any un-recoverable errors until the pipeline is turned down for streaming pipelines.\r\n\r\nThese invalid file errors do not have a resolvable solution and should be logged as errors for the files in question to allow the pipeline to continue progressing.\r\n\r\nAs a file which cannot be read will never recover via a dead letter queue design.  Since no recovery is possible we can simply log the errored file and continue processing.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

data for completed instructions (especially, failed instruction) can cause the thread of `_GrpcDataChannel._read_inputs()` and another thread of `_GrpcDataChannel.input_elemnts()` to be stuck. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation makes this issue in the following scenario.\r\n\r\n* Thread A is for gRPC data channel. It reads data elements and puts to queues in `_GrpcDataChannel._read_inputs()`.\r\n* Thread B is a work thread for an instruction \"process_bundle-10\". A work thread runs user code and pulls data elements from the queue for the instruction in `_GrpcDataChannel.input_elements()` from `BundleProcessor.process_bundle()`.\r\n* Thread C is another work thread for an instruction \"process_bundle-12\". \r\n\r\n1. (Thread A) Read the first chunk of data elements for an instruction \"process_bundle-10\". This adds a new queue to `_received` in `_receiving_queue()` from `_read_inputs()` and put elements to the queue.\r\n2. (Thread B) Pull the first element from the queue for \"process_bundle-10\" in `input_elements()` and throw an exception during processing the element. This remove the queue with `_clean_receiving_queue` in `input_elements()`'s finally clause.\r\n3. (Thread A) Read remaining chunks of elements for \"process_bundle-10\". It will add new queue for \"process_bundle-10\" to `_received` again!  But, be blocked as queue full (maxsize = 5) indefinitely as there is no work thread pulling data elements  of \"process_bundle-10\".\r\n4. (Thread C) Wait on data for another instruction \"process_bundle-12\" but be blocked at `input_elements()` because Thread A has no progress for \"process_bundle-12\" data. \r\n\r\nAs a solution, I suggest managing completed instructions in `_GrpcDataChannel` to avoid data elements queue to be restored so that gRPC data channel thread and work threads will have no blocking issue.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discussion in https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@beam.apache.org/msg24830.html ; a change in Beam 2.30.0 changed the default Avro decoding behavior to decode Avro string fields as `org.apache.avro.util.Utf8`s instead of `java.lang.String`s, by switching from `ReflectDatum{Reader,Writer}` to `SpecificDatum{Reader,Writer}` ([see gist for examples](https://gist.github.com/clairemcginty/97ee6b33c0b5633d5d42d29b1d057d85)). This PR would add back the option to use {Reflect*} suite with an optional Boolean flag. I'm not sure how \"stylistically\" Beam this change is so let me know what you think/whether this change is appropriate to add.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10942 to narrow down where the post submits failed previously. Expands should also not have a PCollection node after them,since the CoGBK coder is handled by the Datasource.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis adds PCollection metrics to the Go SDK, in particular, Element Count, and Sampled Size.\r\n\r\nNew exec.PCollection nodes are added between every processing node in the bundle execution graph.\r\n* The new metrics are only added as MonitoringInfos, not the legacy protos.\r\n* There's about ~10ns added per element per PCollection node due to the atomic additions for every element.\r\n* Elements for sizes are selected randomly, then encoded to count their bytes (w/o window headers).\r\n  * The first three elements are always re-encoded and collected, and then a random pre-select method picks the next index from somewhere later on, proportional to the bundle so far.\r\n  * As currently set up, it will take around 200-300 samples for the first 1M elements, so encoded overhead is limited\r\n* PCollections from a DataSource do 100% \"sampling\", since they're reading the bytes directly anyway. The PCollection node that would have been added after the DataSource is elided from the graph during construction, but re-used to avoid duplicating the logic for concurrently manipulating the size distribution.\r\n  * DataSources can properly handle CoGBKs as well, counting non-header bytes for iterables, and state backed iterables.\r\n  * This still involves a mutex Lock for every update, so we may want to find a lighter weight mechanism to handle the distribution samples from DataSources, or simply opt for the same random sampling.\r\n  * A similar method could be used for DataSinks as well, but not handled in this PR. \r\n  * It's important to note that the runner is already aware of the number of bytes sent and received from the SDK side, so we may opt to remove that  entirely.\r\n* Counts and Samples are yet not made for SideInputs, which would better account for data consumed by DoFns.\r\n\r\nThank you @ajamato for reminding me of the pre-select method for sampling, and @lukecwik for pointing out the DataSource can avoid separate additional encoding costs when measuring elements.\r\n\r\nPerformance impact:\r\nI have two jobs I use for benchmarking this: Pipeline A uses int64s as elements and does simple passthroughs and sums, and Pipeline B where it's using large protocol buffers as elements, which spends a fair amount of CPU time decoding them.\r\n\r\nFor small \"fast\" elements, the overhead is about ~19.5% of the Go side processing (which makes sense if elements are just being passed around or incremented).\r\nFor large \"heavy\" elements, the overhead is about ~0.125% of the Go side of processing.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this is only taking into account the Go SDK worker, and not any runner side costs. This feels acceptable for the time being, though it's possible we can improve this later, especially for \"lighter\" jobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

writing temp tables during BigQuery batch loads, schema update options are invalid since the write disposition is [always hard coded](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/39cf3fccbb3950b9fd0c8938301d192c3ca85cce/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/WriteTables.java#L268) to `WRITE_TRUNCATE`. Including schema update options like this causes the load jobs to fail with the error:\r\n```\r\n\"Schema update options should only be specified with WRITE_APPEND disposition, or with WRITE_TRUNCATE disposition on a table partition.\"\r\n```\r\nWe could also address this by overriding the schema update options value for temp tables in the `processElement` function, similar to how its currently overriding the create and write dispositions. Let me know if that's preferred, or if I've totally missed the mark here otherwise.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik\r\nR: @chamikaramj\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

writing to Snowflake in batch mode, if the number of files to import is more than 1000, the load will fail\r\n\r\nFrom the [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-considerations-load.html)\r\n\r\n> Of the three options for identifying/specifying data files to load from a stage, providing a discrete list of files is generally the fastest; however, the FILES parameter supports a maximum of 1,000 files, meaning a COPY command executed with the FILES parameter can only load up to 1,000 files.\r\n\r\nHere I am just making sure the Snowflake Write respects the number of shards specified by the user with `withShardsNumber`, (it seems to already respect it in streaming).\r\n\r\nLonger term, should Beam issue multiple COPY statements with a distinct list of files when the number of files is more than 1000? Maybe inside the same transaction (BEGIN; END; block)\r\n\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles, @brucearctor \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

page](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/hadoop/). The JavaScript and CSS are making some assumptions that they shouldn't be making, but I don't think it's worth getting into that right now, since there's a workaround. Feel free to cut a ticket to me if this seems like a problem.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

multiple load jobs are needed to write data to a destination table, e.g., when the data is spread over more than 10,000 URIs, WriteToBigQuery in FILE_LOADS mode will write data into temporary tables and then update the temporary tables if schema additions is allowed.\r\n\r\nHowever, update of temporary table scheme does not respect a specified source format of the loading files(i.e. JSON, AVRO). By default source format for BQ load job is `CSV`, which causes jobs with nested schema to fail with the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"message\": \"Cannot load CSV data with a nested schema. Field: nested_field\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn theory, it doesn't matter which source format specifed(besides CSV one) as the load job request doesn't have any source URIs. \r\n\r\ncc: @pabloem @aaltay

presence of streaming side-inputs in some cases can cause a large performance penalty due to cache misses looking up `blockedMap`.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, given the pipeline A -> B, where A is a stateful transform using timers, and B is a ParDo with a side input, this scenario will cause a cache miss on most blockedMap lookups:\r\n\r\n- The first element arrives at A.processElement\r\n- A sets a timer\r\n- Later, the timer for A fires, A.onTimer emits an element\r\n- The element (via fusion) is delivered to B, StreamingSideInputDoFnRunner.processElement calls storeIfBlocked, which reads the blocked map.  This is read not cached, since it's never been access, and this is no longer the first element for the key.\r\n\r\nThe simple fix here is to prefetch blockedMap in startBundle, which will cause it to generally be cached:\r\n\r\n- The first element arrives at A\r\n- StreamingSideInputDoFnRunner.startBundle calls prefetchBlockedMap.  This will almost always be a cached read (and return null), since isNewKey = true\r\n- A.processElement runs, sets a timer\r\n- Later, the timer for A fires\r\n- StreamingSideInputDoFnRunner.prefetchBlockedMap runs (from startBundle).  This will either be a cached read (hopefully) or asynchronously begin a state read.  The state read will likely coalesce with the state activity happening in A.onTimer.\r\n- A.onTimer emits an element\r\n- The element (via fusion) is delivered to B, StreamingSideInputDoFnRunner.processElement calls storeIfBlocked, which reads the blocked map. This read will either be served from cache, or likely be completed already due to the prefetch.\r\n\r\nIn my test pipeline I can confirm that this change drops the state fetches / sec from ~20,000 to ~10.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik @reuvenlax \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the migration of the runner from spark 2 to spark 3 was done, the structured streaming runner was completely put aside, its sources were just moved to spark 2 module in source-overriders and were made invisible to the IDE, so the SS runner code was rendered not modifiable. I had to move the sources back to spark common to make them visible, but it entailed dealing with all the braking changes between spark 2 and 3 regarding the SS runner: encoders, sources, pipeline launching. So I reopened the spark 3 migration ticket and created the SS runner migration sub-tasks to deal with the breaking changes. All are needed at once for compile/tests to pass so I have commits in this PR for all these sub-tasks already squashed per task.\r\n\r\nR: @ibzib as you reveiwed the previous migration PR to spark 3\r\n\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Lang</th>\r\n
