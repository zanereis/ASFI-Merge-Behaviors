successful completion of KafkaProducer#close, it is possible that an application calls KafkaProducer#send. If the send is invoked for a topic for which we do not have any metadata, the producer will block until `max.block.ms` elapses - we do not expect to receive any metadata update in this case because Sender (and NetworkClient) has already exited. It is only when RecordAccumulator#append is invoked that we notice that the producer has already been closed and throw an exception. If `max.block.ms` is set to Long.MaxValue (or a sufficiently high value in general), the producer could block awaiting metadata indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes sure `Metadata#awaitUpdate` periodically checks if the network client has been closed, and if so bails out as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

type inference doesn't currently work for the join functions in Scala as it doesn't know yet the types of the given `KStream[K, V]` or `KTable[K, V]`.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to curry the joiner function. I personally prefer this notation but this also means it differs more from the Java API.\r\nI believe the diff with the Java API is worth in this case as it's not only solving the type inference but also fits better the Scala way of coding (ex: `fold`).\r\n\r\nMoreover any Scala dev will bug and spend little time on these functions trying to understand why the type inference is not working and then get frustrated to be obliged to be explicit here where it's not harmful to be inferred.\r\n\r\nThe change is fairly straight forward but is also breaking, the good news is that we didn't release the Scala API yet, so this is perfect time to do this change.\r\n\r\nThis would also need some documentation update that I'm happy to do if there is positive feedback on this.\r\n\r\nThanks

re-registers its sensor MBean on any sensor change (addition/removal of sensors).\r\nkafka also has per-topic-partition sensors, and the mbean attribute array size is a multiple of those.\r\non large assignment sets (~35K topic partitions assigned to a single consumer), we've seen sensor registration code take 5 entire consecutive minutes (!!) of CPU time.\r\n\r\nthe offending code path is in (re)registering the MBean, which triggers this code (called by `DefaultMBeanServerInterceptor.registerMBean()`)\r\n```java\r\n    private static String getNewMBeanClassName(Object mbeanToRegister)\r\n            throws NotCompliantMBeanException {\r\n        if (mbeanToRegister instanceof DynamicMBean) {\r\n            DynamicMBean mbean = (DynamicMBean) mbeanToRegister;\r\n            final String

creation of the (big) attribute array, while the caller really only wants the mbean name.\r\n\r\nthis patch delays the array creation to the time when the mbean attributes are actually queried - which may be never (in case no one is even looking at the jmx sensors).\r\n\r\nin local testing this removes a ~5 minute delay in rebalancing/assigning large groups of topic partitions.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-12T15:50:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T17:00:17Z","closed_at":"2018-10-08T17:00:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3342832e793d302fa1c8864399f23284e3fdc8bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8a33651beaecef3f6eb7e87284416a2f2049b06f","head":{"label":"radai-rosenblatt:fun-with-jmx","ref":"fun-with-jmx","sha":"8a33651beaecef3f6eb7e87284416a2f2049b06f","user":{"login":"radai-rosenblatt","id":1042632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt","html_url":"https://github.com/radai-rosenblatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64683013,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDY4MzAxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"radai-rosenblatt/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"radai-rosenblatt","id":1042632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt","html_url":"https://github.com/radai-rosenblatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/radai-rosenblatt/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR is a WIP. It has been created to serve as a high-level reference for discussions on the proposal at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-298%3A+Error+Handling+in+Connect._**\r\n\r\nThis feature aims to change the Connect framework to allow it to automatically deal with errors while processing records in a Connector. The following behavior changes are introduced here: \r\n1. **Retry on Failure**: Retry the failed operation a configurable number of times, with backoff between each retry.\r\n2. **Task Tolerance Limits**: Tolerate up to a configurable number of failures in a task.\r\n\r\nWe also add the following ways to report errors, along with sufficient context to simplify the  debugging process: \r\n1. **Log Error Context**: The error information along with processing context is logged along with the standard application logs.\r\n2. **Dead Letter Queue**: Produce the error information and processing context into a Kafka topic.\r\n\r\nThe logged information consists of the following bits:\r\n1. Descriptions of the different stages (source/sink tasks, transformations and converters) in the connector, and their configs.\r\n2. The record which caused the exception.\r\n3. The exception and stack trace, if available.\r\n4. Number of attempts (if applicable) made to execute the failed operation.\r\n5. The time of error.\r\n\r\nNew metrics which will monitor the number of failures, and the behavior of the response handler are added.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here are **backward compatible**. The current behavior in Connect is to kill the task on the first error in any stage. This will remain the default behavior if the connector does not override any of the new configurations which are provided as part of this feature.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

dependence on the internal __consumer_offsets topic to handle `listConsumerGroups()` since it unnecessarily requires users to have Describe access on an internal topic. Instead we query each broker independently. For most clusters, this amounts to the same thing since the default number of partitions for __consumer_offsets is 50. This also provides better encapsulation since it avoids exposing the use of __consumer_offsets, which gives us more flexibility in the future.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

KIP proposes to add the following functionality related to\r\nSASL/OAUTHBEARER:\r\n\r\n1) Allow clients (both brokers when SASL/OAUTHBEARER is the\r\ninter-broker protocol as well as non-broker clients) to flexibly\r\nretrieve an access token from an OAuth 2 authorization server\r\nbased on the declaration of a custom login CallbackHandler\r\nimplementation and have that access token transparently and\r\nautomatically transmitted to a broker for authentication.\r\n\r\n2) Allow brokers to flexibly validate provided access tokens when\r\na client establishes a connection based on the declaration of a\r\ncustom SASL Server CallbackHandler implementation.\r\n\r\n3) Provide implementations of the above retrieval and validation\r\nfeatures based on an unsecured JSON Web Token that function\r\nout-of-the-box with minimal configuration required (i.e.\r\nimplementations of the two types of callback handlers mentioned\r\nabove will be used by default with no need to explicitly declare\r\nthem).\r\n\r\n4) Allow clients (both brokers when SASL/OAUTHBEARER is the\r\ninter-broker protocol as well as non-broker clients) to\r\ntransparently retrieve a new access token in the background\r\nbefore the existing access token expires in case the client has\r\nto open new connections.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ron Dagostino

version is a WIP and intentionally leaves out some additional required changes to keep the reviewing effort more manageable. This version of the process includes\r\n\r\n1. Cleaning up the graph objects to reduce the number of parameters and make the naming conventions more clear.\r\n2. Intercepting all calls to the `InternalToplogyBuilder` and capturing all details required for possible optimizations and building the final topology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include writing out the current physical plan, so no tests included.  The next PR will include additional changes to building the graph and writing the topology out without optimizations, using the current streams tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

patch removed a completedFetch from the completedFetches queue upon a failed parse if it contains no records. The following scenario explains why this is needed for an instance of this case – i.e. in TopicAuthorizationException.\r\n\r\n0. Let's assume a scenario, in which the consumer is attempting to read from a topic without the necessary read permission.\r\n1. In Fetcher#fetchedRecords(), after peeking the completedFetches, the Fetcher#parseCompletedFetch(CompletedFetch) throws a TopicAuthorizationException (as expected).\r\n2. Fetcher#fetchedRecords() passes the TopicAuthorizationException up without having a chance to poll completedFetches. So, the same completedFetch remains at the completedFetches queue.\r\n3. Upon following calls to Fetcher#fetchedRecords(), peeking the completedFetches will always return the same completedFetch independent of any updates to the ACL that the topic is trying to read from.\r\n4. Hence, despite the creation of an ACL with correct permissions, once the consumer sees the TopicAuthorizationException, it will be unable to recover without a

is the corresponding PR of https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-streams-scala/pull/70\r\n\r\nSerdes are confusing in the Scala wrapper:\r\n1) We have wrappers around `Serializer`, `Deserializer` and `Serde` which are not very useful.\r\n2) We have Serdes in 2 places `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serde` and in `com.lightbend.kafka.scala.streams.DefaultSerdes`, instead we should be having only one place where to find all the Serdes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do this PR before the release as this is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't add more so the current tests should be enough.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation

cleaner grows buffers when `result.messagesRead` is zero. This contains the number of filtered messages read from source which can be zero when transactions are used because batches may be discarded.

noticed this issue when running the embedded connectors. There is a assert in SourceRecordWriteCounter.\r\n```\r\n        public SourceRecordWriteCounter(int batchSize, SourceTaskMetricsGroup metricsGroup) {\r\n            assert batchSize > 0;   // this one\r\n            assert metricsGroup != null;\r\n            this.batchSize = batchSize;\r\n            counter = batchSize;\r\n            this.metricsGroup = metricsGroup;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nHence, the empty list will cease the source task. By contrast, empty list is not a issue in production since the assert is usually disabled in production. It seems to me making the behavior consistent is necessary. A simple fix is to remove the assert. Or empty list should be handled as null list. I prefer later since both of them mean \"no data can be processed\".\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

the shutdown of `GlobalStreamThread` to after all `StreamThread` instances have stopped. \r\n\r\nThere can be a race condition where shut down is called on a `StreamThread` then shut down is called on a GlobalStreamThread, but if StreamThread is delayed in shutting down, the GlobalStreamThread can shutdown first.\r\nIf the StreamThread tries to access a GlobalStateStore before closing the user can get an exception stating  \"..Store xxx is currently closed \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTested by running all current streams tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

major version into `streams-scala` artifacts.\r\n\r\nTo differentiate versions of the `kafka-streams-scala` artifact across Scala major versions it's required to encode the version into the artifact name before its published to a maven repository.  This is accomplished by following a similar release process as kafka core, which encodes the Scala major version and then runs the build for each major version of Scala supported.  **This is considered standard practice when releasing Scala libraries**, but is not handled for us automatically with the basic Scala for Gradle support.\r\n\r\nAfter this change you can generate and install the `kafka-streams-scala` artifact into the local maven repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.11 install\r\n$ ./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.12 install\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich results in the following files generated:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/maven-metadata-local.xml\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata-local.xml\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-test-sources.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.pom\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-test.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-scaladoc.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.12/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.12-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/maven-metadata-local.xml\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-test.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata-local.xml\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-scaladoc.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-test-sources.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar\r\n/home/seglo/.m2/repository/org/apache/kafka/kafka-streams-scala_2.11/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/kafka-streams-scala_2.11-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.pom\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Review Code Samples\r\n\r\nI reviewed all the code samples introduced by the main PR.  [I created a sample project which validates the main WordCount example](https://github.com/seglo/kafka-streams-scala-example).  The other examples are code snippets instead of whole programs, but are equivalent to existing tests found in the `apache/kafka` `streams-scala` project, or the original `lightbend/kafka-streams-scala` project.\r\n\r\nCode sample / documentation references\r\n\r\n#### WordCountApplication example\r\n\r\nDocs location:\r\n\r\n* `/documentation/streams/` (Scala Example)\r\n* `/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#scala-dsl-sample-usage`\r\n\r\nSee [`WordCountApplication`](https://github.com/seglo/kafka-streams-scala-example/blob/master/src/main/scala/seglo/WordCountApplication.scala#L3..L38) in sample project.\r\n\r\n> **NOTE**: The `WordCountApplication` usage of `count` reveals how using the `Materialized` does not take advantage of implicit SerDes as other Kafka Streams operators do (operators that accept a `Serialized`, `Consumed`, `Produced` etc).  This is not an issue when you do not want to provide a user-defined and named state store, but to make this example consistent with the Java examples we use the overload of the `count` API which takes the `Materialized` parameter.  It's required to pass the key SerDes in this example because a global serializer is not defined in the Kafka Streams config.  @debasishg is going to follow up with a proposal to amend this API in a separate thread.\r\n\r\n#### Implicit SerDes Example\r\n\r\nDocs location:\r\n\r\n* `/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#scala-dsl-implicit-serdes`\r\n\r\nSee `StreamToTableJoinScalaIntegrationTestImplicitSerdes` test in [`apache/kafka`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/streams/streams-scala/src/test/scala/org/apache/kafka/streams/scala/StreamToTableJoinScalaIntegrationTestImplicitSerdes.scala#L77..L102\r\n\r\n\r\n#### User-defined SerDes Example\r\n\r\nDocs location:\r\n\r\n* `/documentation/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#scala-dsl-user-defined-serdes`\r\n\r\nSee `StreamToTableJoinScalaIntegrationTestImplicitSerdesWithAvro` integration test in [`lightbend/kafka-streams-scala`](https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-streams-scala/).  This test doesn't exist in `apache/kafka` because we didn't want to add the Avro dep.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lightbend/kafka-streams-scala/blob/v0.2.1/src/test/scala/com/lightbend/kafka/scala/streams/StreamToTableJoinScalaIntegrationTestImplicitSerdesWithAvro.scala#L61..L142\r\n\r\n###

current metrics library which Kafka is using is pretty old (version 2.2.0 from Yammer and now we have 4.X from Dropwizard).\r\n\r\nIn the latest versions of the Dropwizard library (which comes from Yammer and this is deprecated), there are a lot of bugfixes and new features included which could be interesting for the metrics (ie: Reservoris, support JDK9, etc).\r\n\r\nThis patch includes the upgrade to this new version of the library so that we could add new features in Kafka metrics.\r\n\r\nAll tests metrics-related in the project have been updated.\r\n\r\nNotice that:\r\n* ``yammer-metrics-count`` metric in ``KafkaServer`` and ``ZookeeperConsumerConnector`` has been renamed to ``dropwizard-metrics-count``.\r\n* All meters have SECONDS as a rate-unit. Previously, all meters in Kafka had the rate unit in seconds except the meter ``RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent`` (in ``KafkaRequestHandlerPool``) which now is in seconds as well (before it was in nanosecs).\r\n* The property ``eventType`` in JMXReporter MBean doesn't exist anymore. So, all meters don't have this mbean property.\r\n* I've done a refactor in the metrics trying to encapsulate a little bit the metrics inside the ``kafka.metrics`` package.\r\n* The current metrics library version used is 3.2.6.
