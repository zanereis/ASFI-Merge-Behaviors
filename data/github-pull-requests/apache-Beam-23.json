are cases where `MapToFields` does not work for sql expressions where a field in the incoming schema is a reserved keyword.\r\n\r\nFor example, with an input schema of \r\n`{foo: int, timestamp: str}`\r\n\r\nThe following would fail:\r\n```\r\n- type: MapToFields\r\n  config:\r\n    language: sql\r\n    append: true\r\n    fields:\r\n      newField: foo\r\n```\r\nas the generated query is \r\n`SELECT (timestamp) AS timestamp, (foo) AS foo, (foo) AS newField FROM PCOLLECTION.`\r\n\r\nwhere `(timestamp) AS timestamp` was generated due to `append: true` being set.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a fix by auto-escaping aliases that are generated by the framework such as the example above, or when naming a field, i.e.\r\n```\r\n- type: MapToFields\r\n  name: Transform\r\n  config:\r\n    language: sql\r\n    fields:\r\n      timestamp: foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The expression itself will not be auto-backticked, so the following is still expected to fail:\r\n```\r\n- type: MapToFields\r\n  config:\r\n    language: sql\r\n    fields:\r\n      foo: timestamp\r\n```\r\na user would be expected to write valid SQL, i.e.\r\n```\r\n- type: MapToFields\r\n  config:\r\n    language: sql\r\n    fields:\r\n      foo: \"`timestamp`\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/blob/master/doc/changelog.rst\">pymongo's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>Changes in Version 4.7</h2>\n<p>PyMongo 4.7 brings a number of improvements including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the :class:<code>pymongo.hello.Hello.connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id</code> properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where inflating a :class:<code>~bson.raw_bson.RawBSONDocument</code> containing a :class:<code>~bson.code.Code</code> would cause an error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Significantly improved the performance of encoding BSON documents to JSON.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for named KMS providers for client side field level encryption.\nPreviously supported KMS providers were only: aws, azure, gcp, kmip, and local.\nThe KMS provider is now expanded to support name suffixes (e.g. local:myname).\nNamed KMS providers enables more than one of each KMS provider type to be configured.\nSee the docstring for :class:<code>~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts</code>.\nNote that named KMS providers requires pymongocrypt &gt;=1.9 and libmongocrypt &gt;=1.9.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt</code> and\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt_expression</code> now allow <code>key_id</code>\nto be passed in as a :class:<code>uuid.UUID</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where :class:<code>~bson.int64.Int64</code> instances could not always be encoded by <code>orjson</code>_. The following now\nworks::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>import orjson\nfrom bson import json_util\norjson.dumps({'a': Int64(1)}, default=json_util.default, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _orjson: <a href=\"https://github.com/ijl/orjson\">https://github.com/ijl/orjson</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug appearing in Python 3.12 where &quot;RuntimeError: can't create new thread at interpreter shutdown&quot;\ncould be written to stderr when a MongoClient's thread starts as the python interpreter is shutting down.</li>\n<li>Added a warning when connecting to DocumentDB and CosmosDB clusters.\nFor more information regarding feature compatibility and support please visit\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb&gt;</code>_ and\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb&gt;</code>_.</li>\n<li>Added the :attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckedOutEvent.duration</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent.duration</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionReadyEvent.duration</code> properties.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>type</code> and <code>kwargs</code> arguments to :class:<code>~pymongo.operations.SearchIndexModel</code> to enable\ncreating vector search indexes in MongoDB Atlas.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>read_concern</code> and <code>write_concern</code> were improperly added to\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.collection.Collection.list_search_indexes</code> queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unavoidable breaking changes\n............................</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/blob/master/doc/changelog.rst\">pymongo's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>Changes in Version 4.7</h2>\n<p>PyMongo 4.7 brings a number of improvements including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the :class:<code>pymongo.hello.Hello.connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id</code> properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where inflating a :class:<code>~bson.raw_bson.RawBSONDocument</code> containing a :class:<code>~bson.code.Code</code> would cause an error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Significantly improved the performance of encoding BSON documents to JSON.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for named KMS providers for client side field level encryption.\nPreviously supported KMS providers were only: aws, azure, gcp, kmip, and local.\nThe KMS provider is now expanded to support name suffixes (e.g. local:myname).\nNamed KMS providers enables more than one of each KMS provider type to be configured.\nSee the docstring for :class:<code>~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts</code>.\nNote that named KMS providers requires pymongocrypt &gt;=1.9 and libmongocrypt &gt;=1.9.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt</code> and\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt_expression</code> now allow <code>key_id</code>\nto be passed in as a :class:<code>uuid.UUID</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where :class:<code>~bson.int64.Int64</code> instances could not always be encoded by <code>orjson</code>_. The following now\nworks::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>import orjson\nfrom bson import json_util\norjson.dumps({'a': Int64(1)}, default=json_util.default, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _orjson: <a href=\"https://github.com/ijl/orjson\">https://github.com/ijl/orjson</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug appearing in Python 3.12 where &quot;RuntimeError: can't create new thread at interpreter shutdown&quot;\ncould be written to stderr when a MongoClient's thread starts as the python interpreter is shutting down.</li>\n<li>Added a warning when connecting to DocumentDB and CosmosDB clusters.\nFor more information regarding feature compatibility and support please visit\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb&gt;</code>_ and\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb&gt;</code>_.</li>\n<li>Added the :attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckedOutEvent.duration</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent.duration</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionReadyEvent.duration</code> properties.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>type</code> and <code>kwargs</code> arguments to :class:<code>~pymongo.operations.SearchIndexModel</code> to enable\ncreating vector search indexes in MongoDB Atlas.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>read_concern</code> and <code>write_concern</code> were improperly added to\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.collection.Collection.list_search_indexes</code> queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unavoidable breaking changes\n............................</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/blob/master/doc/changelog.rst\">pymongo's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>Changes in Version 4.7</h2>\n<p>PyMongo 4.7 brings a number of improvements including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the :class:<code>pymongo.hello.Hello.connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id</code> properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where inflating a :class:<code>~bson.raw_bson.RawBSONDocument</code> containing a :class:<code>~bson.code.Code</code> would cause an error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Significantly improved the performance of encoding BSON documents to JSON.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for named KMS providers for client side field level encryption.\nPreviously supported KMS providers were only: aws, azure, gcp, kmip, and local.\nThe KMS provider is now expanded to support name suffixes (e.g. local:myname).\nNamed KMS providers enables more than one of each KMS provider type to be configured.\nSee the docstring for :class:<code>~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts</code>.\nNote that named KMS providers requires pymongocrypt &gt;=1.9 and libmongocrypt &gt;=1.9.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt</code> and\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt_expression</code> now allow <code>key_id</code>\nto be passed in as a :class:<code>uuid.UUID</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where :class:<code>~bson.int64.Int64</code> instances could not always be encoded by <code>orjson</code>_. The following now\nworks::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>import orjson\nfrom bson import json_util\norjson.dumps({'a': Int64(1)}, default=json_util.default, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _orjson: <a href=\"https://github.com/ijl/orjson\">https://github.com/ijl/orjson</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug appearing in Python 3.12 where &quot;RuntimeError: can't create new thread at interpreter shutdown&quot;\ncould be written to stderr when a MongoClient's thread starts as the python interpreter is shutting down.</li>\n<li>Added a warning when connecting to DocumentDB and CosmosDB clusters.\nFor more information regarding feature compatibility and support please visit\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb&gt;</code>_ and\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb&gt;</code>_.</li>\n<li>Added the :attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckedOutEvent.duration</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent.duration</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionReadyEvent.duration</code> properties.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>type</code> and <code>kwargs</code> arguments to :class:<code>~pymongo.operations.SearchIndexModel</code> to enable\ncreating vector search indexes in MongoDB Atlas.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>read_concern</code> and <code>write_concern</code> were improperly added to\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.collection.Collection.list_search_indexes</code> queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unavoidable breaking changes\n............................</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/blob/master/doc/changelog.rst\">pymongo's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>Changes in Version 4.7</h2>\n<p>PyMongo 4.7 brings a number of improvements including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the :class:<code>pymongo.hello.Hello.connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id</code> properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where inflating a :class:<code>~bson.raw_bson.RawBSONDocument</code> containing a :class:<code>~bson.code.Code</code> would cause an error.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Significantly improved the performance of encoding BSON documents to JSON.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for named KMS providers for client side field level encryption.\nPreviously supported KMS providers were only: aws, azure, gcp, kmip, and local.\nThe KMS provider is now expanded to support name suffixes (e.g. local:myname).\nNamed KMS providers enables more than one of each KMS provider type to be configured.\nSee the docstring for :class:<code>~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts</code>.\nNote that named KMS providers requires pymongocrypt &gt;=1.9 and libmongocrypt &gt;=1.9.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt</code> and\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.encryption.ClientEncryption.encrypt_expression</code> now allow <code>key_id</code>\nto be passed in as a :class:<code>uuid.UUID</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug where :class:<code>~bson.int64.Int64</code> instances could not always be encoded by <code>orjson</code>_. The following now\nworks::</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>import orjson\nfrom bson import json_util\norjson.dumps({'a': Int64(1)}, default=json_util.default, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _orjson: <a href=\"https://github.com/ijl/orjson\">https://github.com/ijl/orjson</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug appearing in Python 3.12 where &quot;RuntimeError: can't create new thread at interpreter shutdown&quot;\ncould be written to stderr when a MongoClient's thread starts as the python interpreter is shutting down.</li>\n<li>Added a warning when connecting to DocumentDB and CosmosDB clusters.\nFor more information regarding feature compatibility and support please visit\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/documentdb&gt;</code>_ and\n<code>mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb &lt;https://mongodb.com/supportability/cosmosdb&gt;</code>_.</li>\n<li>Added the :attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckedOutEvent.duration</code>,\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent.duration</code>, and\n:attr:<code>pymongo.monitoring.ConnectionReadyEvent.duration</code> properties.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>type</code> and <code>kwargs</code> arguments to :class:<code>~pymongo.operations.SearchIndexModel</code> to enable\ncreating vector search indexes in MongoDB Atlas.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>read_concern</code> and <code>write_concern</code> were improperly added to\n:meth:<code>~pymongo.collection.Collection.list_search_indexes</code> queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unavoidable breaking changes\n............................</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

are cases where environments are specified at the transform/windowing level that are not included in the top-level components' environments.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly present when running sql-backed provider on multiple inputs (i.e. when joining 2 pcollections) in Beam YAML which creates 2 default environments, but only declares one in the proto.components.environments section.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the real issue lies in how Beam YAML providers create transforms, but this is a nice safeguard regardless.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of another [PR](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/30559) but without rebase issues)\r\nLengthPrefixCoder doesn't define to_type_hint even though it seems pretty well defined. I've implemented it by just inferring it from its value coder.\r\n\r\nMotivating use case - we have some debug tools that infer the types of pcollections based on to_type_hint. The LPCoder is used in a lot of places.\r\n\r\nBonus/unrelated change - I've pulled out the GitHub issue referenced in the NotImplementedError raised by to_type_hint. Every time I run into this error, I check the github issue and get more confused. It doesn't seem useful to refer to it in the error message, but does still seem relevant, so I pulled it out into a comment.\r\n\r\nTesting Done\r\nI haven't actually run the new unit test I wrote since I'm struggling to get my python sdk dev environment up (I've posted on the dev@ mailing list).

checkpoint won't finalize either, causing repetitive redeliver and duplicate messages.\r\n\r\nI now think the underlying issue is that finalizing checkpoint is not guaranteed to happen timely. This is work as expected. Expiring outstanding checkpoint won't resolve the stucked messages when throughput is low given the asynchronous ack mechanism.\r\n\r\nThus, another option is to expose \"Auto acknowledge\" client option to JmsIO to retain the previous behavior, however, data loss is possible, as in previous implementation \r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

particular Runner v2 does not produce Reiterables, which resulted in the entire stream being read into memory. In this case we can leverage the fact that the first 100MB will be cached and quick to reiterate over.\r\n\r\nFormerly, if the underlying iterable was not a reiterable, it would attempt to store the entire thing in memory. Now it will fall back to re-iterating (and filtering) from the start if the iterator does not support iterating from an arbitrary point, which may not be as efficient in some cases, but will not OOM. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses #30810 adding a /job/cancel endpoint to the prism web server. This endpoint will receive calls from the UI's cancel action (#30811). It simply routes the HTTP post to the backend gRPC job management service, avoiding the need to configure CORS because the UI request would have the same origin.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change adds a BoundedReader implementation based on the newer Point In Time search API (see [doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/point-in-time-api.html)). This API is the recommended mode when reading data from large indexes that imply retrieving documents using deep iteration (more than 10000 hits per slice). \r\n\r\nThis mode should be available for Elasticsearch clusters with version 8 and up. \r\n\r\nWhen using the default read implementation, based on Scrolls, when the index is big enough and the number of documents is large, the creation of slices with more than 10000 elements to be iterated would make the read operations to fail. Now, with the PIT implementation, this is not a problem since ES does not have to keep track of the whole state of the index while iterating, only the current window for the PIT iterator. \r\n\r\nAdding @lord-skinner from Elastic.co for visibility.

PR removes the automated file sharding normally applied when the runner is passed `--useDataStreamForBatch`.\r\n\r\n Currently `FlinkStreamingPipelineTranslator.StreamingShardedWriteFactory` automatically forces file sharding because without it each bundle becomes an output file. Writing a very large number of small files is obviously very inefficient, but for batch jobs we can simply make bundles much much larger which makes sharding unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, `useDataStreamForBatch` can be much slower because of the extra shuffle step. \r\nIt seems the dataflow runner is following a similar approach were sharding in only added in streaming mode. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a basic Iceberg sink. Somewhat in the style of BigQuery file loads:\r\n\r\n - supports Dynamic Destinations\r\n - supports Avro and Parquet file formats\r\n - only accepts Beam rows\r\n\r\nAnd how it works, roughly:\r\n\r\n - First associates each incoming row with some metadata about its destination\r\n - Then tries to write all data in a bundle to its destination. If there is just one, or a few, this will complete.\r\n - If there are lots of destinations, then to avoid OOM we spill to a GBK by destination metadata\r\n - After the GBK we write each group to its destination\r\n\r\nI'm a bit of an Iceberg newb. Byron did the first draft and I just refactored and added some stuff to it. This has some small tests but needs integration tests and larger tests. It is a starting point for integrating with @ahmedabu98's work on managed transforms.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

logic to build a `Labeled Metric Name` to a util file. Currently all of this logic is in `BigQuerySinkMetrics`; however, we can make use of these helper classes to add metrics on other sinks. \r\n\r\nAdditionally this CL includes a few optimizations for Labeled Metric Names described below.\r\n\r\n### Optimizing Building Metric Names:\r\nCurrently we build a labeled metric name by populating a new `NavigableMap` with all metric labels, and then iterating over the `Map` and appending to a `StringBuilder`.  We can optimize the current method with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Directly append metric labels to a `StringBuilder` instead of first populating a `NavigableMap` (supported with a new wrapper class on `StringBuilder`, `MetricNameBuilder`). \r\n2. Directly `append` MetricLabels to the `StringBuilder` instead of first concatenating the <Label value, Label key> pair [src](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7586317).  \r\n\r\n### Optimizing Parsing Metric Names:\r\nMake use of [Splittler.MapSplitter](https://guava.dev/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Splitter.MapSplitter.html#split(java.lang.CharSequence)) to parse labels from a mangled `metric name`. \r\n\r\nSome quick load tests showed that this makes creating/parsing labeled metrics 33%/15% faster respectively.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
