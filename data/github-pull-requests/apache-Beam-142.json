https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12319 introduced an issue that prevents anyone from triggering seed jobs and dependency check job from GitHub pull requests. That PR fixes the issue and makes it available for all beam committers. Other jobs are not affected and still can be triggered by anyone.  At the same time `apache` GitHub organization is removed from GHPRB plugin admins.\r\n\r\nApache LDAP server is used as a source of the beam committers' GitHub usernames. The seed job is extended to fetch the usernames and populate GHPRB user whitelists for the jobs that are not publically triggerable.\r\n______________\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

works around kelloggm/checkerframework-gradle-plugin#117 in which the checker framework is misconfigured due to a confluence of factors, most notably the JVM that Gradle is running under being version 8 and the source level of the project being Java 8. Other factors and fix TBD but since checker is just a source level analysis we do not need to run it redundantly in Java 11 builds.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR:\r\n\r\n - upgrades the Spotbugs plugin to the most recent that works with our version of Gradle [1]\r\n - upgrades Spotbugs to the latest [2]\r\n - inlines most of `spotbugs-filter.xml` to annotations on the code it is about [3]\r\n\r\nRead footnotes if you care about why...\r\n\r\n[1] In #12376 removing rawtypes created new Spotbugs null errors in the expansion service module. But checker is enabled there, so Spotbugs is irrelevant. So I went down a rabbit hole of trying to pass `omitVisitors` to disable the null-related checks via the Spotbugs gradle plugin. I upgraded the plugin to get it working.\r\n[2] Just randomly in my attempt to get the above working, I also tried upgrading Spotbugs. It caught a bunch of new errors and seemed mostly useful to upgrade. So I decided to do it.\r\n[3] I realized I don't need `omitVisitors` and it is very mysterious indeed, and it was better to suppress the relevant errors in the `spotbugs-filter.xml`. But that file was also full of suppressions that shouldn't be suppressed (like default encoding dependence) and also individual suppressions that should be next to the code. So I refactored that.\r\n\r\nNote that the new Spotbugs found _tons_ of null errors everywhere in the code, since the old version of Spotbugs was so bad at catching them. It doesn't make sense to fix those since the best thing to do is just enable checker which understands generics and it not heuristic.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe main goals of migrating to pytest are:\r\n\r\n1. Get Junit structured test output (BEAM-10527).\r\n2. Replace PortableRunnerTest's bespoke timeout mechanism with pytest's (BEAM-9011). ~This also implicitly raises the timeout for all these tests from 60s to 600s, which should reduce the likelihood of timeout flakes (BEAM-8912).~\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nI originally wanted to do this in incremental changes, but I gradually realized a complete overhaul of these tests' configuration was needed. The main challenge was that `flink_runner_test.py` expected to be run as `__main__`, which is impossible with pytest. I basically reworked everything except the tests themselves; the tests themselves are unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Test parametrization\r\n\r\n- I left worker configuration in Gradle because it changes the test dependencies. I moved optimization and streaming into `flink_runner_test.py` because it removes the need to set up separate tox tasks, separate test result files, etc.\r\n- Since `flink_job_server_driver`, `environment_type`, and `environment_config` are all pipeline options, I decided to pass them to `flink_runner_test.py` by introducing a global pytest option, `--test-pipeline-options`. `nose` uses `--test-pipeline-options` for integration tests, so I figured this would be generally useful beyond just these tests in the future.\r\n\r\n# Bonus trivia\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, we were running the exact same streaming test suite *four times* per Jenkins run.\r\n\r\nEvery `flinkCompatibilityMatrix` task ran the entirety of `flink_runner_test.py` which contained two classes: `FlinkRunnerTest` and `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized`. `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized` was basically the same thing as `FlinkRunnerTest`, but it added the `pre_optimize=all` experiment and skipped external transform tests, since the Python optimizer breaks external transforms (BEAM-7252). But we were *also* adding `pre_optimize=all` in Gradle, redundantly.\r\n\r\nThe old configuration looks like this:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ndependsOn flinkCompatibilityMatrix(streaming: false, workerType: CompatibilityMatrixConfig.SDK_WORKER_TYPE.LOOPBACK)\r\ndependsOn flinkCompatibilityMatrix(streaming: true, workerType: CompatibilityMatrixConfig.SDK_WORKER_TYPE.LOOPBACK)\r\ndependsOn flinkCompatibilityMatrix(streaming: true, workerType: CompatibilityMatrixConfig.SDK_WORKER_TYPE.LOOPBACK, preOptimize: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that pre-optimized batch is missing. This is because `flinkCompatibilityMatrixBatchPreOptimize*` would run `FlinkRunnerTest` with `pre_optimize=all` but without skipping the external transform tests, causing failure.\r\n\r\nWhat about streaming, then? Well, the optimizer *doesn't affect streaming pipelines at all*: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/489cf2cbf335f372060469953ed7599f2838a591/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/portability/portable_runner.py#L319\r\n\r\nSo in one invocation of `flinkValidatesRunner`, `flinkCompatibilityMatrixStreamingLoopback` would run `FlinkRunnerTest` (without `pre_optimize=all`) and `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized`, then `flinkCompatibilityMatrixStreamingPreOptimizeLoopback` would run `FlinkRunnerTest` (with `pre_optimize=all`) and `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized` (with `pre_optimize=all` twice). Besides the skips in `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized`, all four tests would be doing the exact same thing.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added a KernelModel module that handles messaging between the\r\n   frontend and the connected kernel. The model silently executes code in the kernel and handles IOPub responses from the kernel for information of the current interactive environment. UI components and other data models can use this module as a data model to communicate with the kernel. When instantiated, this model does not have to be a singleton.\r\n2. Integrated jest test framework with typescript.\r\n3. Advanced prettier to 1.19 so that it can parse typescript optional\r\n   chaining syntax.\r\n4. The tests can be executed with `jlpm jest`. Test details see README.\r\n5. Changes made by jlpm are:\r\n   jlpm add --dev jest @types/jest ts-jest identity-obj-proxy\r\n   jlpm upgrade prettier@^1.19.0\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

are buffered during `DoFnOperator#snapshotState`, called as part of a\r\nFlink checkpoint. This is necessary because flushing out elements in this method\r\ncall would alter the checkpoint barrier alignment. Optionally, elements can be\r\nflushed out before the method call via the `finishBundleBeforeCheckpointing`\r\noption which is turned off by default because it can affect the checkpoint\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nThe buffer is flushed as part of starting a new bundle. A problem arises if no\r\nnew bundle will be started. For example, this can be the case if only a single\r\nelement (e.g. Impulse) is produced as part of a bundle during checkpointing.\r\nAfterwards, when no bundle will be started due to another element arriving,\r\nor a timer firing, the element will not be flushed from the buffer.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR includes independent commits that:\r\n\r\n - excludes generated `AutoValue` classes\r\n - port the codebase to checker annotations so that types can be annotated properly and move annotations adjacent to the types that they are annotating (before Java 8 this was not possible but now it results in a warning if we do not do it)\r\n - annotate overrides of `equals` to note that the argument is nullable\r\n\r\nI did not try to fix nullability errors in `equals` methods because the PR is big enough as it is, and stands alone.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

parsedData member variable to HL7v2Message to allow non-schematized parsing customers to use the HL7v2IO connector\r\n\r\nWith adding additional nullable member variable, a Builder was also added to the class for creating new instances.\r\n\r\nTo support this new member variable, the HL7v2MessageCoder was updated to support the ParsedData class and a coder was created for ParsedData class. In addition, 2 unit tests were added to test coder functionality and validate that the new member variable does not break existing functionality.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
