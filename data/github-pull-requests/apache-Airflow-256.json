Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Jira Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5578)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n* The route that simply redirects to \"/home\" in airflow.www.blueprints has been replaced with an IndexView version from Flask-Appbuilder.\r\n* This IndexView is used as the default and should behave in exactly the same way as before.\r\n* I have added config option for defining your own IndexView class in default_webserver_config.py\r\n* The either the default IndexView or the one defined in default_webserver_config.py is used by the indexview keyword in the appbuilder setup in app.py\r\n* So now a user can define a custom IndexView and choose to do something else instead of a simple redirection.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds no unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits (closely) follow the guidelines.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] The config file contains a description of what to do. And the IndexView class has a basic

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

run.\r\n\r\n- _monitor_pod function didn't catch the error for getting log, then pod\r\nwill stop unexpectedly, add a try-catch here.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5571/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5571\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn my project, I manage 200+ jobs in kubernetes, as I work on, I found a critical bug for kubernetes operator.\r\n\r\nIn pod_launcher.py, _monitor_pod function:\r\n```\r\n        if get_logs:\r\n            logs = self.read_pod_logs(pod) # Here has a retry.\r\n            for line in logs:  # But exception throw from here!\r\n                self.\r\n```\r\nin above code, logs is a HttpResponse, as it implemented _iter_() function, you can use for loop to print the lines. In the other words, here use a http long connection to get endless log.\r\n\r\nThere is only try catch over self.read_pod_logs, however, If the network is disconnected or jitter occurs, for loop will throw error.\r\n\r\nAs I have 200+ job run everyday, I can get 4~5 errors everyday, and each error will let monitor think the pod is down, and then mark the task as failed, then retry it. This eventually lead to data error.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Add a try-catch here and test is not easy to add.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T18:27:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T12:33:57Z","closed_at":"2019-09-29T12:33:57Z","merged_at":"2019-09-29T12:33:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"61190c30df17772ec84e9cb8dc4370c9394fd92c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5a50d20f625d9411baba41ace50256397e668bba","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-87aeee04a","ref":"integration-rst-87aeee04a","sha":"5a50d20f625d9411baba41ace50256397e668bba","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T18:15:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T10:47:15Z","closed_at":"2019-09-29T10:47:15Z","merged_at":"2019-09-29T10:47:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"99ec9b46001830479ad25bd9d2d34d9e5bda6607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8fc6af437673785b79e746992dc7d95aa995833a","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-4cadddf7e","ref":"integration-rst-4cadddf7e","sha":"8fc6af437673785b79e746992dc7d95aa995833a","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T18:13:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:24Z","closed_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:24Z","merged_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"30a9f4c8fc2dfbdf1ac403e8a2a33bc0d1765345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4260b18c8274f8b060f26892c09bdb270c864bc8","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-c9e052448","ref":"integration-rst-c9e052448","sha":"4260b18c8274f8b060f26892c09bdb270c864bc8","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T18:12:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:41Z","closed_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:41Z","merged_at":"2019-09-29T10:08:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"a86b52adf230da2138b69e10067b00c73f5fe40c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/740b8b75d82afe887fc1fac589ceec35579549f9","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-187bc2623","ref":"integration-rst-187bc2623","sha":"740b8b75d82afe887fc1fac589ceec35579549f9","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T18:11:41Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T20:25:57Z","closed_at":"2019-09-28T20:25:57Z","merged_at":"2019-09-28T20:25:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"06fd1925c7047aa67e9c4622d9b79711d0d3ae73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cf5872077602c9839e482a8084d2623823619c9f","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-d541eeadb","ref":"integration-rst-d541eeadb","sha":"cf5872077602c9839e482a8084d2623823619c9f","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is aim to improve airflow security logic, it skip granting DAG permissions to Admin role when refresh dag or restart Airflow. As Admin role has the access to all_dags, we don't need grant the permission to it.\r\nBesides, too many permissions will cause WebUI full of text and some performance issues in DB.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds does not need testing for this extremely good reason: The function didn't have test case before.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5560\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5560\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen using the backfill command with the `--reset_dags` option there is a confirmation prompt and no way to suppress it. I've wired in the `--yes` parameter to do this, note that using `--no_confirm` wasn't an option as thats aliased to '-c' which is used for `--conf` in the backfill sub command.\r\n\r\nFor consistency i've also updated the `airflow dags clear` to use `--yes` instead of `--no_confirm`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdated available tests and tested locally.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n- Done automatically via

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - [AIRFLOW-3152] Kubernetes Pod Operator should support init containers. \r\n     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3152\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR introduces init-containers in the kubernetes pod operator. An `InitContainer` (K8SModel) resource is added to ease the configuration of the init-container in the dag file. For now, InitContainer allows for configuration of the following: `name`, `image`, `init_environment`, `volume_mounts`, `cmds`, `args`. The configuration options we selected to support in this PR is based on our current usecase. We decided against supporting more to keep the scope of this PR small.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - tests/kubernetes/test_init_container.py that contains 2 unit tests for InitContainer\r\n  - tests/minikube/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py - Already existed.  Added an additional test for init-container\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-26T16:35:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T09:06:52Z","closed_at":"2019-12-17T05:14:24Z","merged_at":"2019-12-17T05:14:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e1b0aa7c52e79eeb99698e6190e6f39ca3cab7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/4/labels","id":5271317,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTI3MTMxNw==","number":4,"title":"Airflow

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5560\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5560\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen using the backfill command with the `--reset_dags` option there is a confirmation prompt and no way to suppress it. I've wired in the `--yes` parameter to do this, note that using `--no_confirm` wasn't an option as thats aliased to '-c' which is used for `--conf` in the backfill sub command.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo tests for command line arguments, tested locally though.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n- Done automatically via

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-26T08:46:15Z","updated_at":"2019-09-28T19:45:02Z","closed_at":"2019-09-28T19:45:01Z","merged_at":"2019-09-28T19:45:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfe0ace2808a2a8934fbf578927bde81fc33420e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a5cec6e1c0d20f68c82799a672e722bd09ab638c","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-7","ref":"integration-rst-7","sha":"a5cec6e1c0d20f68c82799a672e722bd09ab638c","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-26T08:45:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T13:17:30Z","closed_at":"2019-09-26T13:17:30Z","merged_at":"2019-09-26T13:17:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"93e856e7021a4b8c60afd737689415ffb1015d7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/364dd325721aa2c2405c663e72887c1993fae40f","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:integration-rst-6","ref":"integration-rst-6","sha":"364dd325721aa2c2405c663e72887c1993fae40f","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira]\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5554\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen statsd is enabled in airflow, there are some calls to the statsd client library that pass timedeltas as the duration for measuring the timing, including dag success and failure durations.\r\n\r\nHowever, handling timedeltas and converting them to millisecond floats is not introduced until statsd 3.3.0. This should be the minimum version required in airflow to avoid a TypeError in these stats.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo code changes introduced, the only behavioral change is inside the statsd library implementation due to the version change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T21:48:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T22:51:37Z","closed_at":"2019-09-26T09:45:28Z","merged_at":"2019-09-26T09:45:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4dd430384de69eef64e1b8f75f27090e51ea964","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/335e00f3f8673fdb25eeafbaaae14eab022acc05","head":{"label":"suburbanmtman:fix_statsd_dependency","ref":"fix_statsd_dependency","sha":"335e00f3f8673fdb25eeafbaaae14eab022acc05","user":{"login":"suburbanmtman","id":2625471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2625471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman","html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171567835,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE1Njc4MzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"suburbanmtman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"suburbanmtman","id":2625471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2625471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman","html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5555\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5553\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nChanged the condition to decode bytes values so they will now be dealt with without having to specify a BQ schema\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's a trivial one line change adding a single condition to do the same task that had been done before.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sent to the workers the full file path is sent. If scheduler and worker are running on different hosts as different users it gives error as the file path of dags on scheduler doesn't match with file path on workers.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5549) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5549\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the BigQueryGetDataOperator returns a list of rows only and not the total number of rows available and the page token to navigate to the next page. It also does not handle pagination (to request the next set of rows). The operator will now return the total number of rows and the next page token as well as handling start_index and page_token parameters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T14:40:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-01T10:34:00Z","closed_at":"2020-01-01T10:34:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb3f715f673aa6321f9a824bee4c765539341628","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5545\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDAG Parsing is currently breaking for long DAGs because test_cycle uses recursive DFS\r\n\r\nExample breaking DAG\r\n\r\ndag = DAG( 'dag', start_date=DEFAULT_DATE, default_args={'owner': 'owner1'})\r\nwith dag: \r\n    last = dag \r\n     for i in range(1,10000): \r\n         op = DummyOperator(task_id='{}'.format(i)) \r\n         last >> op \r\n         last = op\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-24T00:53:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T18:35:01Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T18:34:56Z","merged_at":"2020-09-29T18:34:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"9860719c72be1cab7cd8d117e26457e7207b2be3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

The normal behavior is that a Job will be started, get an istio-proxy sidecar attached to it via the istio mutating webhook, run until completion, then the 'main' container in the pod stops, but istio-proxy hangs around indefinitely. This applies to the Kubernetes Executor.\r\n\r\nVery recently, Istio implemented an endpoint that can be called to cleanly exit the proxy, specifically designed for this use case.\r\n\r\nexplanation: https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15041\r\nistio PR implementing it: https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/15406\r\nAstronomer will make a contribution to handle cleanly exit the istio-proxy by default. This will help Astronomer and other Airflow users making use of the Kubernetes Executor in combination with Istio.\r\n\r\nHere a PR I am closing in favor of contributing to upstream: https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/pull/47\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n - [x] All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it

were built in ci_before_install.sh\r\nbut then in case of static checks, the pre-commit build image step\r\nalso rebuilt CHECKLICENCE and CI images - which was not necessary\r\nand very long in case

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

discussion on original PR suggested removing private_key option as init param\r\n* with this PR, can still provide through extras, but not as init param\r\n* also add support for private_key in tunnel -- missing in original PR for this issue\r\n* remove test related to private_key init param\r\n* use context manager to auto-close socket listener so tests can be re-run\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n@mik-laj @pgagnon @kaxil\r\nIn this PR I attempt to address concerns raised by @pgagnon after the merge of original PR for this issue (#6104 ).  \r\n\r\nNamely, I set out to remove private_key as an init param to SSHHook.  \r\n\r\nWhile doing so, I noticed that original PR did not extend support for `private_key` to the get_tunnel hook method, because it doesn't use `get_conn` but connects independently.  \r\n\r\nThis PR rectifies this oversight by adding this capability.\r\n\r\nI did not create new jira because this feels like continuation of same issue -- just more completely fulfilling its goal, and hopefully in a way that everyone can be happy with.\r\n\r\nThere were some minor tweaks that I made to testing.  \r\n* In test, The `HELLO_SERVER_CMD` was not executed in context manager, so it left the socket listener running, which meant you could not rerun the tests without manually killing the listener process.  I use context manager.  I think this makes sense in same PR because it actively interfered with my ability to test my change.\r\n* In test, I also moved connection creation / destruction to setUpClass / tearDownClass so they are created and destroyed only once for the ssh hook test suite.  Made sense to do this because in adding tunnel test I had to use the connection in more than one place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5528\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5528\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen the `end_of_log_mark` is wrapped in a log record, the `end_of_log_mark` can no longer be able to match the log line in `_read`:\r\n```\r\n        metadata['end_of_log'] = False if not logs \\\r\n            else logs[-1].message == self.end_of_log_mark.strip()\r\n```\r\nIt leads to the UI keeps calling backend and generates lots of load to ES.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n@KevinYang21

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-774\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\n  Since we switched to using sub-processes to parse the DAG files sometime\n  back in 2016(!) the metrics we have been emitting about dag bag size and\n  parsing have been incorrect.\n\n  We have also been emitting metrics from the webserver which is going to\n  be become wrong as we move towards a stateless webserver.\n\n  To fix both of these issues I have stopped emitting the metrics from\n  models.DagBag and only emit them from inside the\n  DagFileProcessorManager.\n\n  (There was also a bug in the `dag.loading-duration.*` we were emitting\n  from the DagBag code where the \"dag_file\" part of that metric was empty.\n  I have fixed that even though I have now deprecated that metric)\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] No, cos these are a bit hard to test usefully, but I have looked at the metrics emmited.\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Currently it will return the entire BQ return object ([reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/list#response-body)) but we might think of extracting fewer parts.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5521\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Add tests for cases of HTTPS urls\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5518\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIf a connection is parsed from a URI (for example if it's overloaded through an environment variable), the schema is the path or the URI.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong because then the HttpHook uses the schema to prefix the base_url. It is particularly visible when using https, which gets transformed to default http. As a result the URLs are built with HTTP instead of HTTPS.\r\n\r\nI propose the following, which it is consistent with what happens when a connection is added through other ways (UI and config files):\r\nAt the Connection level, in parse_from_uri(), implement a special treatment for http connection to have conn_type='http' and schema=scheme\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests :\r\n3 new tests in test_connection_from_uri_with_path, targeting HTTPS. I also changed the pre-existing tests with HTTP URIs to indicate that the schema is HTTP.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-18T16:30:55Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T18:48:04Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T18:48:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eea54ef611cd96bbcca928203043f31b3772862c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

[ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

PR is a backport of #6130 to `v1-10-stable` branch**\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5508\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSometimes we don't need that all available metrics be sent to StatsD server when only a particular subset is relevant (e.g. scheduler or pool).\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for filtering out metrics is because some of them are based on dag ids, creating high cardinality metrics in the StatsD server, leading into scalability issues in an environment with many dags.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to control which metrics should be sent via whitelisting the metrics prefixes, keeping the default behavior of sending all if not specified.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `tests.test_local_settings.TestStatsWithWhitelist`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5508\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSometimes we don't need that all available metrics be sent to StatsD server when only a particular subset is relevant (e.g. scheduler or pool).\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for filtering out metrics is because some of them are based on dag ids, creating high cardinality metrics in the StatsD server, leading into scalability issues in an environment with many dags.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to control which metrics should be sent via whitelisting the metrics prefixes, keeping the default behavior of sending all if not specified.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `tests.test_stats.TestStatsWithWhitelist`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5447\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nStarting in 1.10.4, and continuing in 1.10.5, when using the KubernetesExecutor, with the webserver and scheduler running in the kubernetes cluster, tasks are scheduled, but when added to the task queue, the executor process hangs indefinitely. Based on log messages, it appears to be stuck at this line https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/v1-10-stable/airflow/contrib/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L761\r\n\r\n\"The call to get a default executor was being executed at module import time. If this module is imported by a DAG, it can lead to two executors running in the scheduler, which in the case of the KubernetesExecutor can cause a deadlock. This defers creating the default executor to initialization\" @cwegrzyn\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5447\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe call to get a default executor was being executed at module import time. If this module is imported by a DAG, it can lead to two executors running in the scheduler, which in the case of the KubernetesExecutor can cause a deadlock. This defers creating the default executor to initialization.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5504\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate
