What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. TCP parameters like SO_RCVBUF, SO_SNDBUF and SO_BACKLOG can be set in `SparkConf`, and `org.apache.spark.network.server.TransportServer` can use those parameters to build server by leveraging netty. But for `TransportClientFactory`, there is no such way to set those parameters from `SparkConf`. This could be inconsistent in server and client side when people set parameters in `SparkConf`. So this PR make RPC client to be enable to use those TCP parameters as well.\r\n\r\n2. Add some comments to `MessageDecoder` class to show how wire format looks like for a RPC message and draw a vivid graph to present to detailed wire protocol.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests and refine asking non-existent endpoint test case in `RpcEnvSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-11T14:19:22Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T14:45:13Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T14:26:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2283f0ffaea81785efd5e00580e4fd290a5498c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09734e2a1cf611bfb05e5873f55e9423f8851fe8","head":{"label":"neoremind:SPARK-21701","ref":"SPARK-21701","sha":"09734e2a1cf611bfb05e5873f55e9423f8851fe8","user":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99994581,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTk5NDU4MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"neoremind/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neoremind","id":590102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind","html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neoremind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neoremind/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeveral links on the worker page do not work correctly with the proxy because:\r\n1) They don't acknowledge the proxy\r\n2) They use relative paths (unlike the Application Page which uses full paths)\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes that. It also fixes a mistake in the proxy's Location header parsing which caused it to incorrectly handle redirects.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI checked the validity of every link with the proxy on and off.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-11T06:26:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T09:03:57Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T09:03:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"716b82588e2d026eb59d084fc12e5daa143ee11e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dea4acb1dade21c57ad7a5280bc2ce2d27e0e0f5","head":{"label":"aosagie:fix/proxy-links","ref":"fix/proxy-links","sha":"dea4acb1dade21c57ad7a5280bc2ce2d27e0e0f5","user":{"login":"aosagie","id":1888108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODgxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1888108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie","html_url":"https://github.com/aosagie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95950427,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTk1MDQyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aosagie/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aosagie","id":1888108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODgxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1888108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie","html_url":"https://github.com/aosagie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aosagie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aosagie/spark","description":"Mirror

It can make people confused. \r\nIn addition, in the joinsuite test cases, clear the cache table of work by SharedSQLContext _spark.sharedState.cacheManager.clearCache_ to do, so we do not need to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix the race condition when serializing TaskDescriptions and adding jars by keeping the set of jars and files for a TaskSet constant across the lifetime of the TaskSet.  Otherwise TaskDescription serialization can produce an invalid serialization when new file/jars are added concurrently as the TaskDescription is serialized.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21694\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark already supports launching containers attached to a given CNI network by specifying it via the config `spark.mesos.network.name`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to pass in network labels to CNI plugins via a new config option `spark.mesos.network.labels`. These network labels are key-value pairs that are set in the `NetworkInfo` of both the driver and executor tasks. More details in the related Mesos documentation:  http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/cni/#mesos-meta-data-to-cni-plugins\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests, for both driver and executor tasks.\r\nManual integration test to submit a job with the `spark.mesos.network.labels` option, hit the mesos/state.json endpoint, and check that the labels are set in the driver and executor tasks.\r\n\r\n@ArtRand @skonto

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile discovering optimization rules and their test coverage, I did not find any tests for `CheckCartesianProducts` in the Catalyst folder. So, I decided to create a new test suite. Once I finished, I found a test in `JoinSuite` for this functionality so feel free to discard this change if it does not make much sense. The proposed test suite covers a few additional use cases.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-10T17:25:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T04:36:06Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T04:36:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ee82fecf94ee394df19886e4d9ca14562d3e119","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d04a4120ffa23cd9424dc4aa3301314b51a5d3d","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:check-cartesian-join-tests","ref":"check-cartesian-join-tests","sha":"4d04a4120ffa23cd9424dc4aa3301314b51a5d3d","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of RF is bound by either the cost of statistics computation on workers or by communicating the sufficient statistics.\r\nThis PR will focus on optimizing communication cost.\r\nThe statistics are stored in allStats:\r\n`  private var allStats: Array[Double] = new Array[Double](allStatsSize)`\r\nIn real use case, the size of allStats is very large, and it can be very sparse, especially on the nodes that near the leave of the tree. \r\nIt is better to change allStats from Array to SparseVector before shufffle.\r\nMy tests show the communication is down by about **50% to 90%** with this PR. \r\nTest cases: \r\n1000 features * 200Bins* 2 label, \r\n1000 features * 50Bins * 2label\r\n10000 features * 200Bins * 2 label\r\nfeatureSubsetStrategy: auto, 0.2, 0.1\r\nAll test cases with the config: spark.shuffle.compress=true.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe exist

Why the change?\r\n\r\nIn several places (LogReg, LinReg, SVC) in Spark ML, we collect summary information about training data using `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` and `MulticlassSummarizer`. We have the same code appearing in several places (including test suites). We can eliminate this by creating a common implementation.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. A new class `ml.stat.Summarizers.scala` with `def getRegressionSummarizers` and `def getClassificationSummarizers` that provides a pair of feature and label summarizers.\r\nThis centralizes the duplicated code in: `LinearRegression`, `LinearSVC`, `LogisticRegression` and `DifferentiableLossAggregatorSuite`.\r\n2. Moves `MultiClassSummarizer.scala`(and testSuite) out of `LogisticRegression.scala` to new file `ml.stat.MultiClassSummarizer.scala`, because it is also used by `LinearSVC` and can be generalized.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to how standalone and Mesos have the capability to safely shut down the spark application, there should be a way to safely shut down spark on Yarn mode. This will ensure a clean shutdown and unregistration from yarn.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds YARN support for `--kill SUBMISSION_ID` CLI\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by running a word count job and killing it via the kill CLI.\r\n\r\n- Test condition\r\n    - Application running on Client mode, cluster mode\r\n    - different ACL condition for the client that is submitting the kill CLI\r\n           - no view, modify ACL\r\n           - only view ACL\r\n           - only modify ACL\r\n           - both view, modify ACL\r\n    - spark.authentication true/false\r\n    - using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Did a lot of special handling for non-deterministic projects and filters in optimizer. but not good enough. this patch add a new special case for non-deterministic projects. Deal with that we only need to read user needs fields for non-deterministic projects in optimizer.\r\nFor example, the fields of project contains nondeterministic function(rand function), after a executedPlan optimizer generated:\r\n```\r\n*HashAggregate(keys=[k#403L], functions=[partial_sum(cast(id#402 as bigint))], output=[k#403L, sum#800L])\r\n+- Project [d004#607 AS id#402,

PR as #18799 but for branch 2.2. Main discussion the other PR.\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWhen I was investigating a flaky test, I realized that many places don't check the return value of `HDFSMetadataLog.get(batchId: Long): Option[T]`. When a batch is supposed to be there, the caller just ignores None rather than throwing an error. If some bug causes a query doesn't generate a batch metadata file, this behavior will hide it and allow the query continuing to run and finally delete metadata logs and make it hard to debug.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that places calling HDFSMetadataLog.get always check the return

application listing is still generated from event logs, but is now stored\r\nin a KVStore instance. By default an in-memory store is used, but a new config\r\nallows setting a local disk path to store the data, in which case a LevelDB\r\nstore will be created.\r\n\r\nThe provider stores things internally using the public REST API types; I believe\r\nthis is better going forward since it will make it easier to get rid of the\r\ninternal history server API which is mostly redundant at this point.\r\n\r\nI also added a finalizer to LevelDBIterator, to make sure that resources are\r\neventually released. This helps when code iterates but does not exhaust the\r\niterator, thus not triggering the auto-close code.\r\n\r\nHistoryServerSuite was modified to not re-start the history server unnecessarily;\r\nthis makes the json validation tests run more quickly.","created_at":"2017-08-08T22:14:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T18:27:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-27T12:36:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b54beda4ccca429017868ae2ab5754d824bf0c89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5eff2c5f0891c6ea3fcfbbc7dacbbaf56c1d1788","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20642","ref":"SPARK-20642","sha":"5eff2c5f0891c6ea3fcfbbc7dacbbaf56c1d1788","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen running inside a container, driver program provides a driver host set to the container IP address. This IP address is visible only on the machine where the container is running. Spark executors running on other machines are not able to communicate to the driver program.\r\nNow driver program may use standard SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS variable in order to expose driver host to executors. Just declare SPARK_PUBLIC_DNS=_host machine where the container is running_ in spark-env.sh within the container. Thanks to exposed ports, all requests from executors are forwarded to the driver program within the container.\r\n[SPARK-21668](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21668)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have tested this modification manually. I have a Spark cluster on 3 machines. I run my Spark application in a Docker container; the host machine belongs to the same network as my Spark cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-08T15:50:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T09:03:41Z","closed_at":"2017-08-14T22:47:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"477fa5408cd6cef9d51faaa85ef37c79646ec0f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/570b68f3bb53d74b6948af3a6e876076c6f1cbcf","head":{"label":"tashoyan:SPARK-21668","ref":"SPARK-21668","sha":"570b68f3bb53d74b6948af3a6e876076c6f1cbcf","user":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"08ef7d71875378e324dd23c6d2739e606799c818","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an internal interface for tracking metrics and/or statistics on data on the fly, as it is being written to disk during a `FileFormatWriter` job and partially reimplements SPARK-20703 in terms of it.\r\n\r\nThe interface basically consists of 3 traits:\r\n- `WriteTaskStats`: just a tag for classes that represent statistics collected during a `WriteTask`\r\n  The only constraint it adds is that the class should be `Serializable`, as instances of it will be collected on the driver from all executors at the end of the `WriteJob`.\r\n- `WriteTaskStatsTracker`: a trait for classes that can actually compute statistics based on tuples that are processed by a given `WriteTask` and eventually produce a `WriteTaskStats` instance.\r\n- `WriteJobStatsTracker`: a trait for classes that act as containers of `Serializable` state that's necessary for instantiating `WriteTaskStatsTracker` on executors and finally process the resulting collection of `WriteTaskStats`, once they're gathered back on the driver.\r\n\r\nPotential future use of this interface is e.g. CBO stats maintenance during `INSERT INTO table ... ` operations.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests for SPARK-20703 exercise the new code: `hive/SQLMetricsSuite`, `sql/JavaDataFrameReaderWriterSuite`, etc.","created_at":"2017-08-08T14:56:09Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T19:40:12Z","closed_at":"2017-08-10T19:40:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3273d4e5e42101e8dedc73cc495af779edaed4b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8884b76a03873f35b0fe313dc05315f96acd96f","head":{"label":"adrian-ionescu:write-stats-tracker-api","ref":"write-stats-tracker-api","sha":"e8884b76a03873f35b0fe313dc05315f96acd96f","user":{"login":"adrian-ionescu","id":16205848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16205848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86986142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Njk4NjE0Mg==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"adrian-ionescu/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adrian-ionescu","id":16205848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16205848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr updated `lz4-java` to the latest (v1.4.0) and removed custom `LZ4BlockInputStream`. We currently use custom `LZ4BlockInputStream` to read concatenated byte stream in shuffle. But, this functionality has been implemented in the latest lz4-java (https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java/pull/105). So, we might update the latest to remove the custom `LZ4BlockInputStream`.\r\n\r\nMajor diffs between the latest release and v1.3.0 in the master are as follows (https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java/compare/62f7547abb0819d1ca1e669645ee1a9d26cd60b0...6d4693f56253fcddfad7b441bb8d917b182efa2d);\r\n- fixed NPE in XXHashFactory similarly\r\n- Don't place resources in default package to support shading\r\n- Fixes ByteBuffer methods failing to apply arrayOffset() for array-backed\r\n- Try to load lz4-java from java.library.path, then fallback to bundled\r\n- Add ppc64le binary\r\n- Add s390x JNI binding\r\n- Add basic LZ4 Frame v1.5.0 support\r\n- enable aarch64 support for lz4-java\r\n- Allow unsafeInstance() for ppc64le archiecture\r\n- Add unsafeInstance support for AArch64\r\n- Support 64-bit JNI build on Solaris\r\n- Avoid over-allocating a buffer\r\n- Allow EndMark to be incompressible for LZ4FrameInputStream.\r\n- Concat byte stream\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-08T13:47:36Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T21:18:10Z","closed_at":"2017-08-09T15:34:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13d5b98bcc36641f4a948c0d42605e476ee1fdf1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49135d75309975811c5696dc17fe0b41e28d95f4","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-21276","ref":"SPARK-21276","sha":"49135d75309975811c5696dc17fe0b41e28d95f4","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added code to filter out meaningless constraints inferred in `inferAdditionalConstraints` (e.g., given constraint `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `a = c`, and  `b = c`, we inferred `a = b` and this predicate was trivially true). These constraints possibly cause some `Optimizer` overhead and, for example;\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\").write.saveAsTable(\"t1\")\r\nscala> Seq(1, 2).toDF(\"col\").write.saveAsTable(\"t2\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.col1 = 1 AND 1 = t1.col2 AND t1.col1 = t2.col AND t1.col2 = t2.col\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this query, `InferFiltersFromConstraints` infers a new constraint '(col2#33 = col1#32)' that is appended to the join condition, then `PushPredicateThroughJoin` pushes it down, `ConstantPropagation` replaces '(col2#33 = col1#32)' with '1 = 1' based on other propagated constraints, `ConstantFolding` replaces '1 = 1' with 'true and `BooleanSimplification` finally removes this predicate. However, `InferFiltersFromConstraints` will again infer '(col2#33 = col1#32)' on the next iteration and the process will continue until the limit of iterations is reached.\r\nSee below for more details\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.InferFiltersFromConstraints ===\r\n!Join Inner, ((col1#32 = col#34) && (col2#33 = col#34))

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now spark lets go of executors when they are idle for the 60s (or configurable time). I have seen spark let them go when they are idle but they were really needed. I have seen this issue when the scheduler was waiting to get node locality but that takes longer than the default idle timeout. In these jobs the number of executors goes down really small (less than 10) but there are still like 80,000 tasks to run.\r\nWe should consider not allowing executors to idle timeout if they are still needed according to the number of tasks to be run.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by manually adding executors to `executorsIdsToBeRemoved` list and seeing if those executors were removed when there are a lot of tasks and a high `numExecutorsTarget` value.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode used \r\n\r\nIn  `ExecutorAllocationManager.start()`\r\n\r\n```\r\n    start_time = clock.getTimeMillis()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `ExecutorAllocationManager.schedule()`\r\n```\r\n    val executorIdsToBeRemoved = ArrayBuffer[String]()\r\n    if ( now > start_time + 1000 * 60 * 2) {\r\n      logInfo(\"--- REMOVING 1/2 of the EXECUTORS ---\")\r\n      start_time +=  1000 * 60 * 100\r\n      var counter = 0\r\n      for (x <- executorIds) {\r\n        counter += 1\r\n        if (counter == 2) {\r\n          counter = 0\r\n          executorIdsToBeRemoved += x\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCheck the option \"numFeatures\" only when reading LibSVM, not when writing. When writing, Spark was raising an exception. After the change it will ignore the option completely. @liancheng @HyukjinKwon\r\n\r\n(Maybe the usage should be forbidden when writing, in a major version change?).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added a new API for `coalesce` in `Dataset`; users can specify the custom coalescer which reduces an input Dataset into fewer partitions. This coalescer implementation is the same with the one in `RDD#coalesce` added in #11865 (SPARK-14042).\r\n\r\nThis is the rework of #16766.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in

This is a backport of PR #18783 to the latest released branch 2.2.  \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in JIRA ticket, History page is taking ~1min to load for cases when amount of jobs is 10k+.\r\nMost of the time is currently being spent on DOM manipulations and all additional costs implied by this (browser repaints and reflows).\r\nPR's goal is not to change any behavior but to optimize time of History UI rendering:\r\n\r\n1. The most costly operation is setting `innerHTML` for `duration` column within a loop, which is [extremely unperformant](https://jsperf.com/jquery-append-vs-html-list-performance/24). [Refactoring ](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/b7e56eef4d66af977bd05af58a81e14faf33c211) this helped to get page load time **down to 10-15s**\r\n\r\n2. Second big gain bringing page load time **down to 4s** was [was achieved](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/3630ca212baa94d60c5fe7e4109cf6da26288cec) by detaching table's DOM before parsing it with DataTables jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\n3. Another chunk of improvements ([1]https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/aeeeeb520d156a7293a707aa6bc053a2f83b9ac2), [2](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/e25be9a66b018ba0cc53884f242469b515cb2bf4), [3](https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark/commit/91697079a29138b7581e64f2aa79247fa1a4e4af)) was focused on removing unnecessary DOM manipulations that in total contributed ~250ms to page load time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing Selenium tests in `org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServerSuite`.\r\n\r\nChanges were also tested on Criteo's spark-2.1 fork with 20k+ number of rows in the table, reducing load time to 4s.","created_at":"2017-08-06T12:24:33Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:07:15Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T11:53:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95a31edd10ad33e62a9c973125a66c79dd830a54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3630ca212baa94d60c5fe7e4109cf6da26288cec","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:history-ui-perf-fix-2.2","ref":"history-ui-perf-fix-2.2","sha":"3630ca212baa94d60c5fe7e4109cf6da26288cec","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use https://rversions.r-pkg.org/r-release-win instead of https://rversions.r-pkg.org/r-release to check R's version for Windows correctly.\r\n\r\nWe met a syncing problem with Windows release (see #15709) before. To cut this short, it was ...\r\n\r\n- 3.3.2 release was released but not for Windows for few hours.\r\n- `https://rversions.r-pkg.org/r-release` returns the latest as 3.3.2 and the download link for 3.3.1 becomes `windows/base/old` by our script\r\n- 3.3.2 release for WIndows yet\r\n- 3.3.1 is still not in `windows/base/old` but `windows/base` as the latest\r\n- Failed to download with `windows/base/old` link and builds were broken\r\n\r\nI believe this problem is not only what we met. Please see https://github.com/krlmlr/r-appveyor/commit/01ce943929993bbf27facd2cdc20ae2e03808eb4 and also this `r-release-win` API came out between 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 (assuming to deal with this issue), please see `https://github.com/metacran/rversions.app/issues/2`.\r\n\r\nUsing this API will prevent the problem although it looks quite rare assuming from the commit logs in https://github.com/metacran/rversions.app/commits/master. After 3.3.2, both  `r-release-win` and `r-release` are being updated together.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAppVeyor

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nintroduced `DiskBlockData`, a new implementation of `BlockData` representing a whole file.\r\nthis is somehow related to [SPARK-6236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6236) as well\r\n\r\nThis class follows the implementation of `EncryptedBlockData` just without the encryption. hence:\r\n* `toInputStream` is implemented using a `FileInputStream` (todo: encrypted version actually uses `Channels.newInputStream`, not sure if it's the right choice for this)\r\n* `toNetty` is implemented in terms of `io.netty.channel.DefaultFileRegion`\r\n* `toByteBuffer` fails for files larger than 2GB (same behavior of the original code, just postponed a bit), it also respects the same configuration keys defined by the original code to choose between memory mapping and simple file read.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadded test to DiskStoreSuite and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe definition of `maxRows` in `LocalLimit` operator was simply wrong. This patch introduces a new `maxRowsPerPartition` method and uses that in pruning.

warning when event uptake takes too long, but block anyways. Since dropping events is no longer possible, removed that code.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat looking for advice on why this is a bad idea, due to my relatively limited experience with spark. Or what else it needs to become a good idea.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLiveListenerBus events are now never dropped. I believe that critical components communicate through this bus. I will also add the argument that a buggy spark UI (because of dropped events) is just as useless, and so I am unaware of any kind of event which can be lossy.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBasically we ran it in our production environment. Our past couple spark runs now reliably complete with this change since crucial events never get dropped, but it is unclear how much lag this change might be contributing to the overall run time.\r\n\r\nWe have partition counts in the thousands and executors in the hundreds.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPerhaps the events can be tagged as critical (`queue.put`) or not (`queue.offer`), but this small change is meant to get spark stable again. We have turned up the eventqueue size to 1,000,000 (and fiddled with all available settings), but it still isn't enough. With some probability, enough crucial events are dropped and leaves the spark job hung indefinitely unable to recover (sometimes it does). The large eventqueue also maxed out our driver process with 64GB of memory, so that's pretty much untenable. \r\n\r\nWith this change and over tens (hundreds?) of millions of events flowing through this bus, only 1100 triggered the slow warning, usually around 20ms with a max of 100ms. The current working hypothesis is that the events tend to arrive in bursts and so quickly overwhelm the queue and then quickly empty out.\r\n\r\nRelated to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe patch lets spark web ui use FQDN as its hostname instead of ip address.\r\n\r\nIn current implementation, ip address of a driver host is set to DRIVER_HOST_ADDRESS. This becomes a problem when we enable SSL using \"spark.ssl.enabled\", \"spark.ssl.trustStore\" and \"spark.ssl.keyStore\" properties. When we configure these properties, spark web ui is launched with SSL enabled and the HTTPS server is configured with the custom SSL certificate you configured in these properties.\r\nIn this case, client gets javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException exception when the client accesses the spark web ui because the client fails to verify the SSL certificate (Common Name of the SSL cert does not match with DRIVER_HOST_ADDRESS).\r\n\r\nTo avoid the exception, we should use FQDN of the driver host for DRIVER_HOST_ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nError message that client gets when the client accesses spark web ui:\r\njavax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: Certificate for <10.102.138.239> doesn't match any of the subject alternative names: []\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-21595](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21595) reported that there is excessive spilling to disk due to default spill threshold for `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` being quite small for WINDOW operator. Old behaviour of WINDOW operator (pre https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16909) would hold data in an array for first 4096 records post which it would switch to `UnsafeExternalSorter` and start spilling to disk after reaching `spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold` (or earlier if there was paucity of memory due to excessive consumers).\r\n\r\nCurrently the (switch from in-memory to `UnsafeExternalSorter`) and (`UnsafeExternalSorter` spilling to disk) for `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` is controlled by a single threshold. This PR aims to separate that to have more granular control.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe should reset numRecordsWritten to zero after DiskBlockObjectWriter.commitAndGet called.\r\nBecause when `revertPartialWritesAndClose` be called, we decrease the written records in `ShuffleWriteMetrics` . However, we decreased the written records to zero, this should be wrong, we should only decreased the number reords after the last `commitAndGet` called.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing test.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull
