tests, also consider any terminated threads. Consider the processor stopped only when all active threads and all terminated threads have gone to 0. Additionally, when stopping all components in a Process Group, wait for the PG to reflect that there are no running components.  Previously, we checked for processor active thread counts. However, this was problematic because the flow that was fetched was not fetched recursively and as a result, processors running in embedded groups were not always stopped when the waitForProcessorsStopped(String groupId) method returned. Finally, removed the step for gathering surefire-reports in failed system tests because it was not working as expected and was unneeded because the tests' logs were already gathered into the diagnostic dump that is uploaded.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Both Processors depend on the previous version of Apache Ignite, and the [2.0 Migration Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/Apache+Ignite+2.0+Migration+Guide) highlights a number of important changes.\r\n\r\nThe Processors have not been maintained since their introduction in 2016 and they depend on a Spring XML configuration, which is not an optimal solution for component configuration. New versions of the Processors could be written for Apache Ignite 2.0 that do not have the Spring Framework dependencies, but they should not be based on the current components.\r\n\r\n#

[hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast) from 4.2.7 to 5.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.3.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Connector for Kafka Connect source (BETA)</strong>: Import data from an external system directly into a Hazelcast data pipeline without the need of a Kafka cluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Connector for MongoDB (BETA)</strong>: Read and write from/to MongoDB via this connector and execute SQL queries on Mongo collections directly from Hazelcast.</li>\n<li><strong>Partition-Aware SQL Client</strong>: Send the SQL commands only to the members having the relevant data, which reduces the network hops and improves the query performances.</li>\n<li><strong>Data connection support in SQL</strong>: data connections and mappings using them can be managed using SQL commands.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed the <code>DataLinkFactory</code> interface as <code>DataConnection</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24224\">#24224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>TO_ROW</code> function as it is obsolete, you can use <code>CAST (udtObj AS JSON)</code> instead. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23808\">#23808</a></li>\n<li>SQL mappings for internal maps (<code>__sql.catalog</code> and <code>__jet.*</code>) cannot be created anymore. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24282\">#24282</a></li>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nThe default configuration now connects to <a href=\"https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/\">https://viridian.hazelcast.com/sign-in?next=/</a> instead of Hazelcast Cloud.\nIf you want to continue accessing your Hazelcast Cloud clusters, you need to set the <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> in your configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23290\">#23290</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hazelcast was sending requests to Kubernetes API when deploying an application with embedded Hazelcast and <code>service-dns</code> (DNS lookup mode) specified to a Kubernetes cluster.\nThis was causing the requests to be unsuccessful and the application not to start. This mechanism has been improved by creating Kubernetes client only for the DNS lookup mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23883\">#23883</a></li>\n<li>When advanced networking is enabled, the Kubernetes discovery plugin might have been discovering several endpoints (per each port)\nfor each member's pod.

with registry client\r\nStop nifi\r\nmove  nifi-flow-registry-client-nar (found in lib directory) to another directory\r\nStart nifi\r\nVerify registry client (at above mentioned location) does not work (i.e. it will have a warning as it is now in ghost mode)\r\nRestore  nifi-flow-registry-client-nar to lib directory\r\nRestart nifi\r\nVerify earlier warning is gone and registry client is

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11558) Updates NiFi Registry Jetty Server configuration to apply standard HTTP response headers to all requests regardless of application.\r\n\r\nThe existing implementation uses individual Servlet Filters applied to the UI and REST API applications, which covers normal usage, but does not include requests to the root path of the server.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation uses a Jetty Handler implementation that applies standard headers to all responses. Adjustments include refactoring the Registry Jetty Server to abstract application preparation from the server startup for improved maintenance and testing.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

The processor sends out every FileStatus to a record or a flowfile if it's eligibe for listing\r\n- Introduced HdfsObjectWriter (similar to S3ObjectWriter) to handle record and flowfile writing with a common interface.\r\n- Refactored the recursive file listing method to an iterator, moved the branching conditions to the createPathFilter logic.\r\n- Completely refactored incremental loading. The last entries are not held back anymore.\r\n- Added logic for legacy state transitioning.\r\n- Fixed unit tests\r\n- Updated processor documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11539) Removes the ZooKeeper Migrator Toolkit module and associated documentation sections.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10976) Added support for generalized Cluster State migration from a previous Cluster State Provider, using existing State Provider components within the framework. This capability supports not only ZooKeeper, but other State Provider implementations such as Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Redis.\r\n\r\nWith the ZooKeeper Migrator Toolkit lacking TLS support, it should be removed for NiFi 2.0 in favor of the new generalization implementation in the framework.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10976) Adds a Previous Cluster State Provider to support migrating from one Cluster State Provider implementation to another.\r\n\r\nThe new Previous Cluster Provider property enables conditional transfer of Cluster State from a previous Cluster State Provider to the configured Cluster State Provider. This approaches supports migration scenarios such as moving from ZooKeeper to Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Redis. The implementation is a one-way operation that copies from the Previous Provider to the Current Provider when the Current Provider does not have any state information. After the initial state transfer, the framework ignores the Previous Provider when the Current Provider contains stored informaiton.\r\n\r\nChanges include new methods on the `StateProvider` interface to support enumeration of stored Component Identifiers. The default interface methods indicate that enumeration is not supported, so State Provider implementations must implement both new methods to support transferring state from a previous provider.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11228) Removes the following deprecated Azure Blob Storage Processors:\r\n\r\n- DeleteAzureBlobStorage\r\n- FetchAzureBlobStorage\r\n- ListAzureBlobStorage\r\n- PutAzureBlobStorage\r\n\r\nExisting `v12` variants of these Processors provide the recommend implementation based on the current Azure

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11532](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11532) Removes JUnit 4 and Groovy Test modules from the list of default dependencies in the project root configuration, and also removes the Hamcrest dependency from default dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese changes highlight the extensive work completed to migrate the vast majority of tests to JUnit 5 and Java, leaving a small number of modules and classes on JUnit 4 and Groovy.\r\n\r\nRemoving JUnit 4 and Groovy Test dependencies from the list of defaults helps avoid introducing JUnit 4 and Groovy code in new modules. A small number of modules with remaining dependencies on JUnit 4 and Groovy have declared dependencies on the JUnit Vintage Engine and the Groovy Test library.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing several unnecessary test classes from `nifi-socket-utils`, removing duplicative Registry toolkit tests, and removing the integration test classes from the NiFI Kudu module.\r\n\r\n#

I didn't change this behavior because it might introduce a breaking change, but I'd change this behavior in a separate 2.0 only PR. Simply adding another regex check there would introduce the 4. regex check which is quite ugly so it would be a good opportunity for refactor. Another option would be to add validation for environment variables to ensure they don't contain `.` character, because most shells don't support it. But I'm not sure about that because there are commands that can utilize such env variables even though they are not common.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11034](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11034) This PR creates a `nifi-image-viewer-nar` and moves the image viewer WAR from the `nifi-media-nar` to the `nifi-image-viewer-nar`. The former is not included by default in the assembly, but this PR adds the latter to the assembly so the Image Viewer is always available to the UI. The new NAR is only 16K in size so there should be no concern over the increased footprint.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request
