[com.google.guava:guava](https://github.com/google/guava) from 33.0.0-jre to 33.1.0-jre.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

performance of begin/endRequest support\n-- Implement c3p0-loom UninstrumentedVirtualThreadPerTaskTaskRunnerFactory\n-- Change mind. Eliminate naggingly prescriptive equals/hashCode pseudorequirements\nfrom plugin interfaces, because our canonicalization strategy is by key, doesn' actually\nrely upon those implementations.\n-- Guard collection of MBeanAttributeInfo against items that would have no getter\nor setter to prevent ugly IntrospectionExceptions.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/128\">swaldman/c3p0#128</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/philippscs\"><code>@​philippscs</code></a>!\n-- Let C3P0PooledConnectionPool manager test introspected authentication that appears\nperhaps incomplete, and revert to NULL_AUTH (no-arg DataSource.getConnection()) if\nthe test fails.\nSee, should address, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/159\">swaldman/c3p0#159</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger\"><code>@​sbaeumlisberger</code></a>!\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre6\n-- Lots of documentation work.\n-- Implement attemptResurrectOnCheckin config parameter.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/47\">swaldman/c3p0#47</a>\nThanks Bartosz Radaczyński and Igor Khromov!\n-- Add guard to automaticTestTable preventing use of weird or potentially malicious table names.\nThanks to Andy at Privitar\n-- Pick up com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.DefaultConnectionTester.isValidTimeout as default\nvalue of new connectionIsValidTimeout property, so that users upgrading from previous\nversion still capture the setting from the old config, even as their ConnectionTester\nnow falls back to null.\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre5\n-- Lots of documenting, condensing, clean-up, etc.\n-- Define connectionIsValidTimeout as an ordinary bean-style config parameter.\nPreviously users had to set a universal property (in c3p0.properties or System\nproperties) to set this timeout.\n-- Use simplified isValid(...) based timeout by default, use traditional\nConnectionTester logic only when users specify or force a ConnectionTester\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre4\n-- Define (in a separate, Java 21, project) a loom virtual-threads based\nTaskRunnerFactory, VirtualThreadPerTaskExecutorTaskRunnerFactory.\nSee <a href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom\">https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom</a>\n-- DefineFixedThreadPoolExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, a simple example that\nreplaces c3p0's traditional Thread pool with an unshared ThreadPoolExecutor\nof size numHelperThreads.\n-- Define AbstractExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, which users can extend to use or\nshare java.util.concurrent.Executor instances rather than c3p0's traditional\nhand-rolled Thread pool.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/76\">swaldman/c3p0#76</a>\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/41\">swaldman/c3p0#41</a>\nThanks Michele Rossi, and mysterious GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/ghost\"><code>@​ghost</code></a>.\n-- Define TaskRunnerFactory, and config param TaskRunnerFactoryClassName.\nUsers can provide implementations of TaskRunnerFactory with a public no-arg</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0/blob/0.10.x/CHANGELOG\">com.mchange:c3p0's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>c3p0-0.10.0-pre6\n-- Lots of documentation work.\n-- Implement attemptResurrectOnCheckin config parameter.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/47\">swaldman/c3p0#47</a>\nThanks Bartosz Radaczyński and Igor Khromov!\n-- Add guard to automaticTestTable preventing use of weird or potentially malicious table names.\nThanks to Andy at Privitar\n-- Pick up com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.DefaultConnectionTester.isValidTimeout as default\nvalue of new connectionIsValidTimeout property, so that users upgrading from previous\nversion still capture the setting from the old config, even as their ConnectionTester\nnow falls back to null.\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre5\n-- Lots of documenting, condensing, clean-up, etc.\n-- Define connectionIsValidTimeout as an ordinary bean-style config parameter.\nPreviously users had to set a universal property (in c3p0.properties or System\nproperties) to set this timeout.\n-- Use simplified isValid(...) based timeout by default, use traditional\nConnectionTester logic only when users specify or force a ConnectionTester\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre4\n-- Define (in a separate, Java 21, project) a loom virtual-threads based\nTaskRunnerFactory, VirtualThreadPerTaskExecutorTaskRunnerFactory.\nSee <a href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom\">https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom</a>\n-- DefineFixedThreadPoolExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, a simple example that\nreplaces c3p0's traditional Thread pool with an unshared ThreadPoolExecutor\nof size numHelperThreads.\n-- Define AbstractExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, which users can extend to use or\nshare java.util.concurrent.Executor instances rather than c3p0's traditional\nhand-rolled Thread pool.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/76\">swaldman/c3p0#76</a>\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/41\">swaldman/c3p0#41</a>\nThanks Michele Rossi, and mysterious GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/ghost\"><code>@​ghost</code></a>.\n-- Define TaskRunnerFactory, and config param TaskRunnerFactoryClassName.\nUsers can provide implementations of TaskRunnerFactory with a public no-arg\nconstructor to take full control of threading, thread-pooling, etc.\n-- Support SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for deterministic builds.\n(Here and in mchange-commons-java.)\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/163\">swaldman/c3p0#163</a>\n<a href=\"https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/\">https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/</a>\n<a

Bernhard M. Wiedemann!\n-- Eliminate support for traditional reflective proxies.\n-- Fix bad anchor in docs, thanks Hakan!\n-- Relicense to allow users to opt for LGPL-2.1 or later, rather than LGPL-2.1-only.\n(Here and in mchange-commons-java.)\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/133\">swaldman/c3p0#133</a>\nThanks Bernhard E. Reiter!\n-- Update to mchange-commons-java 0.3.0\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre3\n-- Have build fail if we try to build with an unexpected JVM version.\nWe want to use a consistent JVM version (currently 11) and target version (currently 7)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[com.mchange:c3p0](https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0) from 0.9.5.5 to 0.10.0-pre5.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0/blob/0.10.x/CHANGELOG\">com.mchange:c3p0's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>c3p0-0.10.0-pre5\n-- Lots of documenting, condensing, clean-up, etc.\n-- Define connectionIsValidTimeout as an ordinary bean-style config parameter.\nPreviously users had to set a universal property (in c3p0.properties or System\nproperties) to set this timeout.\n-- Use simplified isValid(...) based timeout by default, use traditional\nConnectionTester logic only when users specify or force a ConnectionTester\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre4\n-- Define (in a separate, Java 21, project) a loom virtual-threads based\nTaskRunnerFactory, VirtualThreadPerTaskExecutorTaskRunnerFactory.\nSee <a href=\"https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom\">https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0-loom</a>\n-- DefineFixedThreadPoolExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, a simple example that\nreplaces c3p0's traditional Thread pool with an unshared ThreadPoolExecutor\nof size numHelperThreads.\n-- Define AbstractExecutorTaskRunnerFactory, which users can extend to use or\nshare java.util.concurrent.Executor instances rather than c3p0's traditional\nhand-rolled Thread pool.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/76\">swaldman/c3p0#76</a>\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/41\">swaldman/c3p0#41</a>\nThanks Michele Rossi, and mysterious GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/ghost\"><code>@​ghost</code></a>.\n-- Define TaskRunnerFactory, and config param TaskRunnerFactoryClassName.\nUsers can provide implementations of TaskRunnerFactory with a public no-arg\nconstructor to take full control of threading, thread-pooling, etc.\n-- Support SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for deterministic builds.\n(Here and in mchange-commons-java.)\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/163\">swaldman/c3p0#163</a>\n<a

Bernhard M. Wiedemann!\n-- Eliminate support for traditional reflective proxies.\n-- Fix bad anchor in docs, thanks Hakan!\n-- Relicense to allow users to opt for LGPL-2.1 or later, rather than LGPL-2.1-only.\n(Here and in mchange-commons-java.)\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/133\">swaldman/c3p0#133</a>\nThanks Bernhard E. Reiter!\n-- Update to mchange-commons-java 0.3.0\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre3\n-- Have build fail if we try to build with an unexpected JVM version.\nWe want to use a consistent JVM version (currently 11) and target version (currently 7)\nwhen we build c3p0.\n-- Remove vestiges of unsupported BasicResourcePool.AcquireTask\n-- Disable very slow handholding function intended to help with misspellings / misspecifications\nof resource &quot;/c3p0-config.xml&quot;\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/121\">swaldman/c3p0#121</a>\nThanks chinhodado!\n-- Let PooledDataSource implement AutoCloseable.\nThis necessitates targeting Java 7, rather than Java 6, classfiles.\nThanks koszta5!\n-- Bring documentation of acquireRetryAttempts into sync with c3p0's actual behavior.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/132\">swaldman/c3p0#132</a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
