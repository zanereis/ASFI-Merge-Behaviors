Change Logs\r\n\r\nRecord key field is mandatory, so this PR removed the default value for that field. This is not backwards compatible. Most users set the record key, but if some user relied on `uuid` (current default value) as record key, then they need to set it explicitly using `hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change or performance impact. But, it needs to be called out in the release notes. Created HUDI-4849 to track doc changes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to call out in our documentation that users relying on `uuid` default record key field should explicitly set the config.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### File Listing\r\n\r\nThis change addresses the problem of eagerly listing all partitions in a table when initializing `HoodieFileIndex`. \r\nInstead following file-listing modes are introduced:\r\n\r\n - `Lazy`: allows to list table lazily by breaking down the process into 2 steps: a) listing of partitions (actual list of partition folders) and b) listing of files w/in these partitions. Having 2-step process enables us to apply partition-pruning after step A, avoiding the need to list every partition in the table (which could be an issue for large tables, not using metadata table)\r\n\r\n - `Eager`: (existing behavior) whole table will be listing during initialization of `HoodieFileIndex`\r\n\r\n#### Partition Path Prefix Analysis\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to avoid the need of listing deep folder structure even to just list all partitions folders (step A) for very large tables with multiple partition columns, new heuristic have been implemented called _partition-path prefix analysis_: we try to to achieve efficiency in avoiding necessity to recursively list deep folder structures of partitioned tables w/ multiple partition columns, by carefully analyzing provided partition predicates. \r\n\r\nIn cases when partition-predicates have\r\n        - The form of equality predicates w/ static literals (for ex, like `date = '2022-01-01'`)\r\n        - Fully specified proper prefix of the partition schema (ie fully binding first N columns\r\n          of the partition schema adhering to hereby described rules)\r\n\r\nWe will try to exploit this specific structure, and try to reduce the scope of a necessary file-listings of partitions of the table to just the sub-folder under relative prefix of the partition-path derived from the partition-column predicates. For ex, consider following scenario:\r\n\r\nTable's partition schema (in-order):\r\n\r\n```\r\n   country_code: string (for ex, 'us')\r\n   date: string (for ex, '2022-01-01')\r\n```\r\n\r\nTable's folder structure:\r\n```\r\n   us/\r\n    |- 2022-01-01/\r\n    |- 2022-01-02/\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case we have incoming query specifies following predicates:\r\n\r\n   `... WHERE country_code = 'us' AND date = '2022-01-01'`\r\n\r\nWe can deduce full partition-path w/o doing a single listing: `us/2022-01-01`.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, such heuristic will be helpful in cases when current partition-pruning couldn't be applied -- for ex, in case when non-encoded slashes are used inside partition-path column values, currently we won't be able to apply partition-pruning b/c we can't recover partition-values back from the partition-paths when there are more than 1 partition column (b/c there's no way to tell where one partition-value ends and other begins). Previously, we will be regressing and reading the whole table as non-partitioned one. \r\n\r\nWith partition-path prefix analysis we can handle this case by avoiding even listing irrelevant partitions in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Configs\r\n\r\nTo control aforementioned behavior following 2 new configs have been introduced:\r\n`hoodie.datasource.read.file.index.listing.mode.override`\r\n`hoodie.datasource.read.file.index.listing.partition-path-prefix.analysis.enabled`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo API change, and will improve performance for spark query with partition filter.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-15T08:57:06Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T03:13:38Z","closed_at":"2022-11-17T03:13:38Z","merged_at":"2022-11-17T03:13:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5590cdd0fe3b476abadfcb7059133517342a377","assignee":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2177611461,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc3NjExNDYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"a6fcaf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new action type called build to actually perform index data generation. This action contains two steps as clustering action does:\r\n- Generate action plan to clarify which files and which indexes need to be built;\r\n- Execute build index according action plan generated by step one;\r\n \r\nCall procedure will be implemented as well to show or run build action.\r\n\r\nClasses in package ``org.apache.hudi.secondary.index.lucene.hadoop`` were copied from package ``org.apache.solr.hdfs.store`` in Apache Solr project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUser can use ``call show_build(table=> '$table'[, path => $path], limit => $limit, show_involved_partition => [true/false])`` to list build commits,  use``call run_build(table => '$table'[, path => $path], predicate => '$predicate', show_involved_partition => [true/false])`` to trigger new build action if conditions are satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue where the markers are not deleted after full-record bootstrap operation (with instant time `00000000000002`).  In the functional tests of bootstrap, the temp folder verification is added to check if there are remaining marker folders.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none**\r\nNo impact on public API.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the functional tests fail with the new temp folder verification.  After this PR, the function tests pass.\r\nThe change is also verified by running the Deltastreamer with bootstrap operation.  All markers are deleted after the bootstrap is complete.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue where MOR read-optimized query may miss reading data in the file groups under inflight compaction.  Here is the particular scenario in which the current `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex` does not handle correctly:\r\n\r\nMOR table, Hudi timeline:\r\n> Deltacommit1 (DC1, completed), writing file group 1 (fg1)\r\n> Deltacommit2 (DC2, completed), updating fg1\r\n> Compaction3 (C3, inflight), compacting fg1\r\n> Deltacommit4 (DC4, completed), updating fg1\r\n\r\nOn storage, these are the data files generated:\r\nfile slice v1:\r\n```\r\nfg1_dc1.parquet (from DC1)\r\n.fg1_dc1.log (from DC2)\r\n```\r\nfile slice v2:\r\n```\r\nfg1_c3.parquet (from C3, inflight)\r\n.fg1_c3.log (from DC4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's look at how `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex` loads the file index before this fix.  In `doRefresh()` method, the following code is executed to find all relevant file slices for MOR read-optimized query.  Note that `getLatestFileSlicesBeforeOrOn` API is used.  This API returns the latest file slices of each file group.  When there is pending compaction (request or inflight) and new log files are added to the compacted file slice, like the example above, the compacted base file in the latest file slice is excluded, as it is not yet committed to the table.  For the example above, this means that for file group 1, only `.fg1_c3.log` is included in the file slice, omitting the non-compaction base file, causing the miss of reading the records in this filegroup.\r\n```\r\ncachedAllInputFileSlices = partitionFiles.keySet().stream()\r\n         .collect(Collectors.toMap(\r\n             Function.identity(),\r\n             partitionPath ->\r\n                 queryInstant.map(instant ->\r\n                     fileSystemView.getLatestFileSlicesBeforeOrOn(partitionPath.path, instant, true)\r\n                 )\r\n                   .orElse(fileSystemView.getLatestFileSlices(partitionPath.path))\r\n                   .collect(Collectors.toList())\r\n             )\r\n         );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe index loading logic of MOR snapshot query is correct, using the `getLatestMergedFileSlicesBeforeOrOn` API.  This API not only fetches the latest slices, but also include the base and log files of the second-last version of the file slice in the same file group as the latest file slice that is under compaction, e.g., `fg1_dc1.parquet`, `.fg1_dc1.log`, and `.fg1_c3.log`.  In fact, the file index serves the purpose of providing the table view for different query engines to provide file splits based on different table and query types, there is no need to differentiate table and query types at this layer (even before this fix, we store log files in the file slices for MOR read-optimized query).  For example, in Spark, MOR read-optimized query goes through the `BaseFileOnlyRelation` which reads base files only.\r\n```\r\ncachedAllInputFileSlices = partitionFiles.keySet().stream()\r\n          .collect(Collectors.toMap(\r\n              Function.identity(),\r\n              partitionPath ->\r\n                  queryInstant.map(instant ->\r\n                    fileSystemView.getLatestMergedFileSlicesBeforeOrOn(partitionPath.path, queryInstant.get())\r\n                        .collect(Collectors.toList())\r\n                  )\r\n                  .orElse(Collections.emptyList())\r\n              )\r\n          );\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the above, the fix is to use the above general logic to load file index for all table and query types.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\nThere is no public API change.  The fix applies to the file index for MOR read-optimized query only.\r\n\r\nA new test is added based on the scenario described above.  Before this fix, the test fails as all the base files of the file group that is under compaction are filtered out.

versions 16 or later enforce strong encapsulation and do now allow to invoke `setAccessible` on a field, especially when the `isAccessible` is false. More details in [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403). This PR attempts to address that for `ObjectSizeCalculator`. An immediate use case where this would be beneficial is integrating Hudi with other libraries, e.g. Trino, that are using higher versions of JDK. \r\n\r\nWe evaluated two other approaches:\r\n1. Get the object size base on the amount of byte serialized. However, this runs into error if the incoming object does not implement `Serializable`.\r\n2. Use Java's [Instrumentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.instrument/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html) API. For this, we need to create an instrumentation agent that can be hooked to the JVM. If Hudi was a standalone project, then we could have taken but since Hudi is integrated into other projects as well, we need to invest some time to figure out how to hook our instrumentation agent into those running JVMs.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n* If fields are accessible, run the usual code.\r\n* Else, use Java Object Layout ([JOL](https://github.com/openjdk/jol)) to get object size.\r\n* Add test with different types of objects.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nHigh. \r\nThis PR makes changes in `ObjectSizeEstimator`, which is on the hot path.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\nHigh.\r\nTests have been added to cover various types of objects, both serializable and no serializable.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-12T15:08:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T17:04:05Z","closed_at":"2022-09-28T17:04:05Z","merged_at":"2022-09-28T17:04:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"f13962281c8ad380d19188069934e827699e7238","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the serialization of commit metadata to remove redundant fields in serialized commit metadata in JSON.\r\n\r\nThe commit metadata in JSON (*.commit, *.deltacommit) written to the Hudi timeline under `.hoodie/` contains redundant fields that can be trimmed.  As shown below, the same set of write stats is written to both \"partitionToWriteStats\" and \"writeStats\", doubling the size and increasing the serde overhead.  Other fields like \"totalRecordsDeleted\", \"writePartitionPaths\", \"fileIdAndRelativePaths\", etc., can be removed as well as they are derived from \"partitionToWriteStats\" and not directly used by HoodieCommitMetadata class.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the problem is that, when serializing the `HoodieCommitMetadata` and `HoodieReplaceCommitMetadata` class instance to JSON string, the getters are also included, which introduce necessary fields.  The fix is to exclude getters, setters and creators in the serialization config.  After the fix, the fields are consistent with Avro schema definition, i.e., `HoodieCommitMetadata.avsc` and `HoodieReplaceCommitMetadata.avsc`.\r\n\r\nTwo more unit tests are added to verify the field names in the serialized JSON.\r\n\r\nSample commit metadata before this change:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"partitionToWriteStats\" : {\r\n    \"2022/1/31\" : [ {\r\n      \"fileId\" :

The existing APIs fetching the commit information still work.\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested on both COW and MOR tables with Deltastreamer.  The changes are both backward and forward compatible, i.e., (1) Spark and utilities bundles after this PR can load time and commit metadata with redundant fields generated before this PR, (2) Spark

Change Logs\r\nThe rangeBucket is mainly used in the scenario of sync mysql tables to hudi in near real time, which avoids the disadvantage of the fixed number of buckets in simpleBucket.\r\n\r\nUsually, in the mysql table, there is an auto-increment id primary key field. In the mysql cdc synchronization scenario, we can use the database name and table name as the partition field of hudi, and id as the primary key field of the hudi table，This can deal with sub-library and sub-table. \r\n\r\nIn order to reach better sync performance, we usually use bucket index, but if we use simple bucket index, because the number of buckets is fixed, it is difficult for us to determine a suitable number of buckets, and as the table grows, The previous number of buckets will no longer be appropriate. \r\n\r\nSo, I propose rangeBucekt, in the simpleBucket index, the bucket number is （hash % bucketNum）, and in rangetBucket, we will use （ id / fixedStep） to determine the bucket number, so that as the id grows，The number of buckets also increases. For example, if step = 10 is set, then, because the id is self-increasing, a bucket will be generated for every 10 pieces of data.\r\n\r\nIn the actual scenario, I set step=1,000,000, the usual size of each mysql record is similar, then the approximate size of each bucket will be 50M ~ 350M, which avoids the disadvantage of the fixed number of buckets in simpleBucket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new index RANGE_BUCKET, people can ust it like following:\r\n\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.INDEX_TYPE.key, IndexType.BUCKET.name()).\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.BUCKET_INDEX_ENGINE_TYPE.key, \"RANGE_BUCKET\").\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.RANGE_BUCKET_STEP_SIZE.key, 2).\r\n      option(HoodieLayoutConfig.LAYOUT_TYPE.key,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6170, we've rebased Hudi to instead mostly rely on Log4j2 bridge and implementations (in tests). \r\n\r\nHowever we actually missed the fact that `log4j-1.2-api` isn't actually an API module (as advertised) but rather a fully-fledged implementation bringing in requirement to provide Log4j2 impl jar on the classpath.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRisk level: Medium\r\n\r\nTBD Manual bundles compatibility verification.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUse base table instant for metadata table initialization.\r\n\r\nWhen initializing COL-STATS or BLOOM-FILTER partition in metadata table, currently we assign instant of metadata table to the records. The value will finally be overwritten in `HoodieAppendHandle` using instant from base table.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the behavior by assigning instant of base table at the very beginning.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Removes a confusing method, `getReporter()` in the abstract class MetricsReporter since we want to be calling `stop` the MetricsReporter instances to make sure they are cleaned up properly\r\n- Updates Metrics.java to call `stop` method\r\n- Updates implementations of MetricsReporter to no longer implement getReporter method\r\n- Fixes import order in classes that were touched as part of this PR\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe API for the `MetricsReporter` is changing due to the removal of the `getReporter` method\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the cow scenario, updating just one piece of data in the file would require rewriting the entire file, which is very inefficient. In reality, many update datasets are long-tail datasets, so it is necessary to improve the efficiency of cow update. This pr is a solution for how to speed up cow update. This requires expanding the index structure. www.sf-tech.com.cn combined record_level_index with this solution in the production environment last year and achieved a good performance improvement.\r\n\r\n#### How partial update works\r\na. Add one more member variable(Integer rowGroupId) into the class HoodieRecordLocation.\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"md-fences md-end-block ty-contain-cm modeLoaded\" spellcheck=\"false\" lang=\"java\" cid=\"n35\" mdtype=\"fences\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; overflow: visible; font-family: var(--monospace); font-size: 0.9em; display: block; break-inside: avoid; text-align: left; white-space: normal; background-image: inherit; background-position: inherit; background-size: inherit; background-repeat: inherit; background-attachment: inherit; background-origin: inherit; background-clip: inherit; background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248); position: relative !important; border: 1px solid rgb(231, 234, 237); border-radius: 3px; padding: 8px 4px 6px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; width: inherit; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\">public class HoodieRecordLocation implements Serializable {\r\n protected String instantTime;\r\n protected String fileId;\r\n /**\r\n * the index of key in parquet rowGroup num.\r\n */\r\n protected Integer rowGroupNum;\r\n }</pre>\r\n\r\nb. Number of rowgroup of a Parquet starts from 0 which continously increases util BlockSize reaches `hoodie.parquet.block.size`.  Since every record in parquet belongs to a rowgroup, we can simply use parquet API to locate rowgroup num of new record which needs to be written into corresponding parquet file, and then record rowgroup num into hoodieRecordLocation of each hoodieRecord.  HoodieRecordLocations will be collected into WriteStatus which will be updated to the index on batch.\r\n\r\nc. At phase of tagging index, rowgroup num will be queried out, so that they can be used to accelerate updating files.\r\n\r\nConcrete flow of upserting is as below:\r\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11922131/189511884-992f93e2-3e47-4170-b60b-2cb74e4dc8a7.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### steps of writing a parquet file on cow\r\n\r\n1.  (upserting) data preparing\r\n\r\n    At phase of tag indexing, find out `HoodieRecord.currentLocation.rowGroupNum` of updating records, if rowgroup num is empty, record does implicitly not exists, which means current operation is a INSERT, otherwise DELETE or UPDATE. At next, rowgroup nums are used to make grouping by of the updating records so as to collect all rowgroups which should be updated.\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11922131/189511868-a412f494-394c-4a82-b74e-5618068bb7b0.jpg)\r\n\r\n2.  rowgroup updating\r\n\r\n    The process of updating rowgroup is divided into 5 steps.\r\n\r\n    1.  Deserializing and decompressing the columns which need to be combined and assembled into a List<Pari<rowKey,Pari<offset,record>> structure,   where offset represents record's row number in rowgroup(every rowgroup's row number starts with zero).\r\n\r\n    2.  Using HoodieRecordPayload#getInsertValue to deserialize the upserting data, then invoking HoodieRecordPayload#getInsertValue to combine the updating rows. \r\n\r\n    3.  Converting combined data into column structure, just like `[{\"name\":\"zs\",\"age\":10},{\"name\":\"ls\",\"age\":20}] ==> {\"name\":[\"sz\",\"ls\"],\"age\":[10,20]}`\r\n\r\n    4.  Iterating rowgroups' columns. if column needn't be updated then writing column by datapage without decompression and deserialization.\r\n\r\n    5.  If column needs to be updated then write columns one by one.\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11922131/189511895-f5a8583b-6617-4592-b5d0-cb7e76cdba0a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  insert

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith the development of hudi, more and more users choose hudi to build their own ingestion pipelines to support real-time or batch upsert requirements.\r\nSubsequently, some of them may ask the community for help, such as how to improve the performance of their hudi ingestion jobs? Why did their hudi jobs fail? etc.\r\n\r\nFor the volunteers in the hudi community, dealing with such issue, the volunteers may ask users to provide a list of information, including engine context, job configs,\r\ndata pattern, Spark UI, etc. Users need to spend extra effort to review their own jobs, collect metrics one buy one according to the list and give feedback to volunteers.\r\nBy the way, unexpected errors may occur at this time as users are manually collecting these information.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are relatively high communication costs for both volunteers and users.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for advanced users, they also need some way to efficiently understand the characteristics of their hudi tables, including data volume, upsert pattern, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn order to expose hudi table context more efficiently, this RFC propose a Diagnostic Reporter Tool.\r\nThis tool can be turned on as the final stage in ingestion job after commit which will collect common troubleshooting information including engine(take spark as example here) runtime information and generate a diagnostic report json file.\r\n\r\nOr users can trigger this diagnostic reporter tool using hudi-cli to generate this report json file.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\n_Choose one. If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-05T13:50:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T19:30:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"734d92532b3ae579c667adc69dee5b2c35a482ef","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith the development of hudi, more and more users choose hudi to build their own ingestion pipelines to support real-time or batch upsert requirements.\r\nSubsequently, some of them may ask the community for help, such as how to improve the performance of their hudi ingestion jobs? Why did their hudi jobs fail? etc.\r\n\r\nFor the volunteers in the hudi community, dealing with such issue, the volunteers may ask users to provide a list of information, including engine context, job configs, data pattern, Spark UI, etc. Users need to spend extra effort to review their own jobs, collect metrics one buy one according to the list and give feedback to volunteers.\r\nBy the way, unexpected errors may occur at this time as users are manually collecting these information.\r\n\r\nObviously, there are relatively high communication costs for both volunteers and users.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for advanced users, they also need some way to efficiently understand the characteristics of their hudi tables, including data volume, upsert pattern, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn order to expose hudi table context more efficiently, this RFC propose a Diagnostic Reporter Tool.\r\nThis tool can be turned on as the final stage in ingestion job after commit which will collect common troubleshooting information including engine(take spark as example here) runtime information and generate a diagnostic report json file.\r\n\r\nOr users can trigger this diagnostic reporter tool using hudi-cli to generate this report json file.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none **\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\nMake hudi-flink of mor table also will gen CreateHandle with base bucket not exist.\r\nOpen deduplicate function for mor table.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThe duplicate issue is from hudi-flink mor table, which first append log, but not compact right now, so the bucket num is not in base file;\r\nWhen spark use loadPartitionBucketIdFileIdMapping of org.apache.hudi.index.bucket.HoodieSimpleBucketIndex, it will not find the bucket num which written by hudi-flink, so it will generate a new one which not consistent with hudi-flink.\r\nAfter this change, when hudi-flink write mor table use bucket index, it will firstly consider to write base parquet file after deduplicate, if base file exists, it will change to write log file, follow spark way seems more stable for mor table.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n1. Make hudi-flink of mor table also will gen CreateHandle with base bucket not exist.\r\n2. Open deduplicate function for mor table.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThe duplicate issue is from hudi-flink mor table, which first append log, but not compact right now, so the bucket num is not in base file;\r\nWhen spark use loadPartitionBucketIdFileIdMapping of org.apache.hudi.index.bucket.HoodieSimpleBucketIndex, it will not find the bucket num which written by hudi-flink, so it will generate a new one which not consistent with hudi-flink.\r\nAfter this change, when hudi-flink write mor table use bucket index, it will firstly consider to write base parquet file after deduplicate, if base file exists, it will change to write log file, follow spark way seems more stable for mor table.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ]

Change Logs\r\n\r\nHudi has partition aware clustering strategy and recent partitions based strategy as well for clustering. This plays out well if partitioning is based on dates. but what incase partitioning is based on some other random field. \r\n\r\nSo, this patch introduces a clustering filter mode to filter based on recently altered files. \r\n\r\nFor eg, if a user configures clustering to run every 5 commits, every time clustering runs, it will consider only the file groups touched in the last 5 commits. This will avoid triggering repeated clustering for already clustered file groups as well and clustering will be very fast since only delta file groups are considered. \r\n\r\nAdded a new config named, `hoodie.clustering.plan.filter.mode` whose possible values are NONE, RECENTLY_UPDATED_FILES and RECENTLY_INSERTED_FILES. \r\n\r\nRECENTLY_INSERTED_FILES would also benefit those users who are just trying to sort the records based on some column leveraging clustering. It may not make sense to re-cluster(or re sort) a file group which is already clustered/sorted. So, with this filtering logic, one can filter for those file groups which had inserts in the last N commits whenever clustering gets triggered. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low/medium**\r\n\r\nThis is a feature or enhancement to clustering which could benefit some users based on their need.

Change Logs\r\nWe want to make sure that committers are complying with our pull request template and title naming scheme. Impact is purposely left blank to test this. There are a few considerations before this should be accepted. They may be acceptable but I wanted to check. The first is that this does not stop the other workflows from running if it fails. Secondly the error it outputs is very vague. \r\n\r\n#### Specifics\r\n##### Title\r\nthe title must have [HUDI-XXXX] or [MINOR]. It can't have both. The tag can be placed anywhere in the title. [HUDI-XXXX] must have at least 1 digits but can have more. HUDI and MINOR must both be capitalized.\r\n##### Body\r\nIt must have Change Logs, Impact, risk level, and contributor's checklist. It must be in that order. You cannot change the number of \\#'s before those words or the spacing. You cannot duplicate those lines. You must put new text under change logs and impact. If risk level is medium or high, you must put text below that as well. Risk level must only be none, low, medium, or high.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe impact is that more pull requests will fail checks, and it will lead to better organization for this project\r\n\r\n**Risk level:  low**\r\nIt's an easy change to roll back, but it could be very frustrating for committers if there are false negatives\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nDocumentation must be added to .github about how to update the pr template\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-02T15:05:39Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T10:36:04Z","closed_at":"2022-10-11T10:36:04Z","merged_at":"2022-10-11T10:36:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e0b5b77ca0256fba1f1f33756dca51542e494c9","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719804076,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODA0MDc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:minor","name":"priority:minor","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"everything
