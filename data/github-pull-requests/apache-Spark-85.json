for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `RewriteMergeIntoTable`, similar to `RewriteUpdateTable` and `RewriteDeleteFromTable`, to handle MERGE commands for delta-based sources. Support for group-based sources will come in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nImplementation notes:\r\n\r\n- `RewriteMergeIntoTable` is an analyzer rule that acts similar to existing rules for deletes and updates.\r\n- `MergeRows` is a new logical node that holds a set of instructions to apply on a joined target and source datasets.\r\n    - `Instruction` is a parent trait for all instructions.\r\n    - `Keep` means a joined row is part of the result of this MERGE operation.\r\n    - `Split` means a joined row is part of the result but must be split into two rows (update into delete and insert).\r\n- `MergeRowsExec` is a new physical node that is responsible for merging rows and producing a delta of rows. It also performs the MERGE cardinality check if needed.\r\n- `NO_BROADCAST_AND_REPLICATION` is a new internal join hint to prohibit broadcasting and replicating the target table to perform the cardinality check in MERGE operations, as required by the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed per SPIP SPARK-35801.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new SQL config to enable/disable MERGE cardinality check required by the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with tests. There are more tests in `AlignMergeAssignmentsSuite`, which was merged earlier.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-04T05:47:35Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T20:08:01Z","closed_at":"2023-06-13T04:02:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3b5a264bbae3c1a153731fdeb4027daee86304a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/55f05c63de714cb3e9b83ab766c51e160a95813a","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-43885","ref":"spark-43885","sha":"55f05c63de714cb3e9b83ab766c51e160a95813a","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to use `checkError()` to check `Exception` in `*Insert*Suite`, include:\r\n- sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLInsertTestSuite\r\n- sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/DeltaBasedUpdateAsDeleteAndInsertTableSuite\r\n- sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/sources/InsertSuite\r\n- sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/InsertSuite\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nBut this pr does not include some of these cases, which directly throw AnalysisExecution, such as:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/898ad77900d887ac64800a616bd382def816eea6/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/rules.scala#L505-L515\r\nAfter this PR, I will refactor these, assign them a name, and use the error framework. As these tasks are completed, all exceptions checks in `*Insert*Suite` will eventually be migrated to `checkError`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMigration on checkError() will make the tests independent from the text of error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test.\r\n- Pass GA.","created_at":"2023-06-03T12:05:01Z","updated_at":"2023-06-03T19:22:29Z","closed_at":"2023-06-03T19:22:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"871c5b6cdf93878de81652d0652f355f6c71accf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3702e3f59b686f1824b34b0468afa15a2502ec1d","head":{"label":"panbingkun:check_error_for_insert_suites","ref":"check_error_for_insert_suites","sha":"3702e3f59b686f1824b34b0468afa15a2502ec1d","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd new SparkListenerEvent during Spark Connect ExecutePlanRequest:\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationStarted\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationParsed\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationCanceled,\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationFailed\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationFinished\r\nSparkListenerConnectOperationClosed\r\nSparkListenerConnectSessionClosed .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHiveThriftServer2EventManager currently posts events to the listener bus to allow external listeners to track query execution. Mirror these events in Spark Connect.\r\nCreated new events instead of reusing the thrift events to allow them to evolve separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual + Unit +

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to cancel running Spark Jobs is by using `SparkContext.cancelJobGroup`, using a job group name that was previously set using `SparkContext.setJobGroup`. This is problematic if multiple different parts of the system want to do cancellation, and set their own ids.\r\n\r\nFor example, BroadcastExchangeExec sets it's own job group, which may override job group set by user. This way, if user cancels the job group they set in the \"parent\" execution, it will not cancel these broadcast jobs launches from within their jobs. It would also be useful in e.g. Spark Connect to be able to cancel jobs without overriding jobGroupId, which may be used and needed for other purposes.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, consider add API to set tags on jobs, and to cancel jobs using tags:\r\n* `SparkContext.addJobTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n* `SparkContext.removeJobTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n* `SparkContext.getJobTags(): Set[String]`\r\n* `SparkContext.clearJobTags(): Unit`\r\n* `SparkContext.cancelJobsWithTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n* `DAGScheduler.cancelJobsWithTag(tag: String): Unit`\r\n\r\nAlso added `SparkContext.setInterruptOnCancel(interruptOnCancel: Boolean): Unit`, which previously could only be set in `setJobGroup`.\r\n\r\nThe tags are also added to `JobData` and `AppStatusTracker`. A new API is added to `SparkStatusTracker`:\r\n* `SparkStatusTracker.getJobIdsForTag(jobTag: String): Array[Int]`\r\n\r\nUse the new API internally in BroadcastExchangeExec instead of cancellation using job group, to fix the issue with these not being cancelled by user-set jobgroupid. Now, the user set jobgroupid should propagate into broadcast execution.\r\n\r\nAlso, switch cancellation in Spark Connect to use tag instead of jobgroup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there may be multiple places that want to cancel a set of jobs, with different scopes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe APIs described above are added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test to JobCancellationSuite.","created_at":"2023-06-02T21:02:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T13:29:51Z","closed_at":"2023-06-21T00:21:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df7befbadfdd5fef02eb93b1a3cffadba30f8275","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d52ff2e548ba79eb7802feb0e72dad8e7b625357","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-43952","ref":"SPARK-43952","sha":"d52ff2e548ba79eb7802feb0e72dad8e7b625357","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

(https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/495) for namedtuple issue (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/460). PySpark relies on namedtuple heavily especially for RDD.

Existing test cases should pass too.","created_at":"2023-06-02T08:18:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:36Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T10:38:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bf67adc4e6041211c3e356a0f0f1f22cfc1d1b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1bb29621da272babe975ca708ffa01f39604ecf","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:cloudpickle-upgrade","ref":"cloudpickle-upgrade","sha":"c1bb29621da272babe975ca708ffa01f39604ecf","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix bug for SQLQueryTestSuite when run on local env.\r\nWhen SQLQueryTestSuite runs `identifier-clause.sql` in various different environments, the statement `DESCRIBE SCHEMA IDENTIFIER('id' || 'ent')` will generate different `Owner` values. Currently, this value(`runner`) is OK when runs on GA, but it will fail on local. In order to be compatible with the results of various different environments, the `Owner` value is removed for comparison.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bugs and compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test.\r\n- Pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLimit the number of LiveTask objects in AppStatusListener to avoid a memory leak.\r\nChange the type of liveTasks map (used to refresh the state of the UI kvstore) from HashMap to LinkedHashMap and remove the eldest entries from the map after each put as long as the map size exceeds the new int property spark.ui.refreshedTasks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the rate of Spark events is very high, some of the events may be dropped from the event queue that AppStatusListener is subscribed to since the listener can't keep up. When an event of type onTaskEnd is dropped, the LiveTask object associated to that task remains forever in the liveTasks map of AppStatusListener. This can lead to a memory leak since these LiveTask objects keep adding up in the map (even though the corresponding tasks are finished) and can't be garbage collected.\r\nFor more information check the discussion on the jira thread : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43523.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have performed performance tests before and after the fix. I have used Spark in standalone mode. I have used Spark shell to submit the queries. I have deliberately reduced the event queue capacity to 10 to be able to reproduce the memory leak quickly. I have generated a heap dump of the driver's JVM after each test and analyzed it using Eclipse Memory Analyzer.\r\n*N.B: if no onTaskEnd events were dropped there would be 0 LiveTask objects in the AppStatusListener.liveTasks map at the end of the test.*\r\n#### Setup :\r\n- Cluster (spark-env.sh) :\r\n```\r\nSPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=1g\r\nSPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=4\r\nSPARK_WORKER_CORES=32 \r\n``` \r\n- Code submitted using spark-shell :\r\n```\r\nimport Array._\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\nval uuid = udf(() => java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString)\r\n(1 to 100).foreach(x => sc.parallelize(range(x, 10000)).toDF(\"id\")\r\n .repartition(1000)\r\n .withColumn(\"uuid\", uuid())\r\n .withColumn(\"key\", substring(col(\"uuid\"), 0, 2))\r\n .groupBy(\"key\")\r\n .agg(count(\"id\").alias(\"c\"))\r\n .sort(col(\"c\").desc)\r\n .filter(x => x.getAs[Long](1) % 3 == 0)\r\n .count()) \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Pre-fix test :\r\n- Spark shell command :\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --master spark://DESKTOP-UMJ5H4Q.localdomain:7077 --conf spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.capacity=10 --conf spark.executor.memory=512m --conf spark.executor.instances=3\r\n```\r\n- Relevant logs :\r\n```\r\n23/05/20 16:44:04 ERROR AsyncEventQueue: Dropping event from queue appStatus.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate all tags in a `Project` while resolving of expressions and missing columns in `ColumnResolutionHelper.resolveExprsAndAddMissingAttrs()`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41221.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the bug reproduced by the query below:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> WITH\r\n                   >   t1 AS (select key from values ('a') t(key)),\r\n                   >   t2 AS (select key from values ('a') t(key))\r\n                   > SELECT t1.key\r\n                   > FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 USING (key)\r\n                   > WHERE t1.key NOT LIKE 'bb.%';\r\n[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name `t1`.`key` cannot be resolved. Did you mean one of the following? [`key`].; line 4 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. It fixes a bug, and outputs the expected result: `a`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy new test added to `using-join.sql`:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z using-join.sql\"\r\n```\r\nand the related test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveContextCompatibilitySuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDrop vector type support in Distributed ML for spark connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDistributed ML is designed for supporting fitting / transforming over either spark dataframe or local pandas dataframe.\r\nCurrently pandas dataframe does not have vector type similar to `spark.ml.linalg.Vector`, and Vector type does not have too much advantages except saving sparse features dataset.\r\n\r\nTo make the interface consistent, we decided initial version does not support vector type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-01T08:53:49Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T12:28:19Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T12:28:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b16e800a7b6ff33b23a81dccbfd94d33fc095f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b60345edf282595d7d03c7aadc5e77cbfc99ea9a","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:mlv2-drop-vector-type-support","ref":"mlv2-drop-vector-type-support","sha":"b60345edf282595d7d03c7aadc5e77cbfc99ea9a","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen SubqueryBroadcastExec reuses the keys of Broadcast HashedRelation for dynamic partition pruning, it will put all the keys in an Array, and then call the distinct of the Array to remove the duplicates.\r\n\r\nIn general, Broadcast HashedRelation may have many rows, and the repetition rate of this key is high. Doing so will cause this Array to occupy a large amount of memory (and this memory is not managed by MemoryManager), which may trigger OOM.\r\n\r\nThe approach here is to directly call the toSet of the iterator to deduplicate, which can prevent the creation of a large array.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid the occurrence of the following OOM

request?\r\n\r\nOptimize InjectRuntimeFilter by use the proper `rowCount` to initialize `BloomFilterAggregate` if exists.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt'll cause a poor filtering effect in case there is a big gap in the number of rows between `filterApplicationSidePlan`  and `filterCreationSidePlan`, if alway use the row count of `filterCreationSidePlan` to initialize BloomFilterAggregate In `InjectRuntimeFilter` Rule.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the support of the regular files in `SparkSession.addArtifacts`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo users can add the regular files in the worker nodes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds the support of arbitrary regular files in `SparkSession.addArtifacts`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a couple of unittests.\r\n\r\nAlso manually tested in `local-cluster`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar` --master \"local-cluster[2,2,1024]\"\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://localhost:15002\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConsolidating BlockId parsing and handling helps to cut down on errors arising from parsing the BlockId and also eliminates the need to manually synchronize the code across different places that parse the BlockIds.\r\n\r\nMost of the offending code was in common/network-shuffle and it looks like the reason was because BlockId was in core/ so it wasn't usable by common/network-shuffle. So this patch moves BlockId.scala into common/storage-common to make it accessible everywhere.\r\n\r\nValidated that there are no further instances of manual BlockId parsing or creation by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit grep -i 'split(\"_\")' **.scala | grep -v \"/test/\"\r\ncore/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/EventLogFileWriters.scala:    val index = eventLogFileName.stripPrefix(EVENT_LOG_FILE_NAME_PREFIX).split(\"_\")(0)\r\n\r\ngit grep -i 'split(\"_\")' **.java | grep -v \"/test/\"\r\ncommon/network-common/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/server/OneForOneStreamManager.java:    String[] array = streamChunkId.split(\"_\");\r\n\r\n\r\ngit grep '\"_\" +' **.scala | grep -v \"BlockId.scala:\" | grep -v \"/test/\" | grep -v '(\"_\" + _)'\r\ncore/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/EventLogFileWriters.scala:      base + \"_\" + Utils.sanitizeDirName(appAttemptId.get)\r\ncore/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/logging/DriverLogger.scala:  val DRIVER_LOG_FILE_SUFFIX = \"_\" + DRIVER_LOG_FILE\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/Pipeline.scala:      val stageDir = idxFormat.format(stageIdx) + \"_\" + stageUid\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/feature/VectorAssembler.scala:                attr.withName(c + \"_\" + attr.name.get)\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/feature/VectorAssembler.scala:                attr.withName(c + \"_\" + i)\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/feature/VectorAssembler.scala:              NumericAttribute.defaultAttr.withName(c + \"_\" + i)\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/GeneralizedLinearRegression.scala:      Array.tabulate[String](origModel.numFeatures)((x: Int) => model.getFeaturesCol + \"_\" + x)\r\nmllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/util/Identifiable.scala:    prefix + \"_\" + UUID.randomUUID().toString.takeRight(12)\r\nsql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala:            stringValue + \"_\" + suffix\r\nsql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/basicLogicalOperators.scala:          aggregates.map(agg => AttributeReference(value + \"_\" + agg.sql, agg.dataType)())\r\nsql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/execution/HiveTempPath.scala:        new Path(stagingPathName + \"_\" + executionId + \"-\" + TaskRunner.getTaskRunnerID))\r\nsql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/execution/HiveTempPath.scala:    \"hive_\" + format.format(new Date) + \"_\" + Math.abs(rand.nextLong)\r\n\r\ngit grep '\"_\" +' **.java | grep -v \"/test/\"\r\ncommon/network-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleServiceMetrics.java:      baseName + \"_\" + valueName,\r\n\r\n\r\ngit grep 'String\\.format(.*_' **.java | grep -v \"/test/\"\r\ncommon/network-common/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/sasl/SparkSaslServer.java:    String qop = alwaysEncrypt ?

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a logical type \"custom-decimal\" in Avro, which can only be backed by physical type long, and will be convert into decimal type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA user would like to represent currency (for money) after loading Avro into SQL type. However, there isn't a good way to represent it in Avro. This custom type will allow them to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded several unit test cases to test the new \"custom-decimal\" to be loaded successfully and also exception cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-31T19:02:39Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T20:09:56Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T02:41:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b0149014dfe2fa523886e1a63813896b0979eb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f63e69f6bfb5d2fc5f1f4bb42501ec7ea816cd1b","head":{"label":"siying:customdecimal","ref":"customdecimal","sha":"f63e69f6bfb5d2fc5f1f4bb42501ec7ea816cd1b","user":{"login":"siying","id":5334567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzQ1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5334567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying","html_url":"https://github.com/siying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":631023173,"node_id":"R_kgDOJZymRQ","name":"spark","full_name":"siying/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"siying","id":5334567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzQ1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5334567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying","html_url":"https://github.com/siying","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siying/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/siying/spark","description":"Apache

changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to automatically register `immutable.ArraySeq$ofRef` to `KryoSerializer` for Scala 2.13 to make `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` can run successfully using Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nScala 2.13 introduced `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq$ofRef`, but it has not been registered with `KryoSerializer`, so when run `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` using `KryoSerializer` and  enabled `spark.kryo.registrationRequired`(This is the default behavior after SPARK-42074), there will be the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Failed to serialize task 741, not attempting to retry it. Exception during serialization: java.io.IOException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Class is not registered: scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq$ofRef\r\nNote: To register this class use:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for shuffle-hash join for following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* left outer join with left-side build\r\n* right outer join with right-side build\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is similar to SPARK-32399, which supports shuffle-hash join for full outer join.\r\n\r\nThe same methods fullOuterJoinWithUniqueKey and fullOuterJoinWithNonUniqueKey are improved to support the new case. These methods are called after the HashedRelation is already constructed of the build side, and do these two iterations:\r\n\r\n1.  Iterate Stream side.\r\n  a. If find match on build side, mark.\r\n  b. If no match on build side, join with null build-side row and add to result\r\n2. Iterate build side.\r\n  a. If find marked for match, add joined row to result\r\n  b. If no match marked, join with null stream-side row\r\n\r\nThe left outer join with left-side build, and right outer join with right-side build, need only a subset of these logics, namely replacing 1b above with a no-op.\r\n\r\nCodegen is left for a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor joins of these types, shuffle-hash join can be more performant than sort-merge join, especially if the big table is large, as it skips an expensive sort of the big table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a _ipython_key_completions_() method on Python DataFrame class to return column names. Main benefit of this is that IPython autocomplete engine(or any other using IPython e.g. IPython kernel, Databricks Notebooks) to get autocomplete suggestions for [] will suggest column names on the completion df[|].\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor those who use IPython as autocomplete engine can get column name as suggested for df[|]. Increases productivity for anyone who uses an autocomplete engine on pyspark code.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/assets/109033553/dd575144-bb87-47a9-8387-de2e51f1c8e2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a check for `__dir__()` in `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame` to filter out those illegal column name(e.g: name?1, name 1, 2name etc.). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. df.illegal_column_ame is not runnable(like df.name?1 will raise error)\r\n2. In this way, `df.|` won't suggest those illegal name. This behavior is consistent with pandas. \r\n3. Supplement for 2: This behavior is not consistent with `getattr`, `getattr(df, 'column with space') `still works even though `df.column with space` does not. `dir()` can only be consistent with one of these. Pandas behavior is to have `dir()` consistent with dot notation, so we are choosing to conform with Pandas; even though there is an argument to choose the other behavior.\r\n\r\nExample with this change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/assets/109033553/a3238b5a-53b6-4994-8f11-c804a5aab53b\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWill change the output of dir(df). If the user chooses to use the private method df.__dir__(), they will also notice an output and docstring difference there.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew doctest with three assertions. Output where I only ran this test:\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-30 at 11 12 04 AM\"

DataFrameWithColAttrs(DataFrame):\r\n  def __init__(self, df):\r\n    super().__init__(df._jdf, df._sql_ctx if df._sql_ctx else df._session)\r\n\r\n  def __dir__(self):\r\n    attrs = set(super().__dir__())\r\n    attrs.update(filter(lambda s: s.isidentifier(), self.columns))\r\n    return

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #40988.\r\n\r\nFix `to_pandas` to support the older Spark.\r\n\r\nFor the server:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n% ./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the client with the change here:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct('x' as x)) as t(a, b)\").toPandas()\r\n   a           b\r\n0  1  {'x': 'x'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.structHandlingMode` introduced in #40988 does not exist in the older Spark, `<3.5` \r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct('x' as x)) as t(a, b)\").toPandas()\r\nTraceback (most recent call

_any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe newer Spark Connect client will work with `Spark<3.5`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake CTAS have a `UnaryRunnableCommand` trait rather than `LeafRunnableCommand` node to facilitate them having children (the query) that can be traversed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes introduced to resolve SPARK-41713 in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39220 modified the CTAS commands from having a `DataWritingCommand` trait to a `LeafRunnableCommand` trait. The `DataWritingCommand` trait extends `UnaryCommand`, and has children set to the value of query in the CTAS command. This means that when `transform` is called to traverse the tree with the CTAS command at the root, the entire query is traversed. `LeafRunnableCommand` has a `LeafLike` trait which explicitly sets the value of children to `Nil`. This means that when `transform` is called on the command, no children are found and the query is unaffected by the rule.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that optimizer rules that rely on `transform` (such as `BooleanSimplification`) to traverse the tree do not work with a CTAS. \r\n\r\nThis can be demonstrated with a simple query in spark-shell. Without the CTAS we can run a command with an easily simplified boolean expression (`id == 9 && id == 9`) and see it gets optimized out:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"689\" alt=\"Working - No Create Table\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/77486246/3199bd30-27f0-4425-842a-4c664c37f986\">\r\n\r\nWith a CTAS, the optimisation does not get applied (as we can see from the `AND` still present in the optimized and physical plans):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"689\" alt=\"Not Working - Create Table\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/77486246/7484146d-4d38-403d-a1c5-7d13f361fd1e\">\r\n\r\nThis works in 3.2.0 which had the old CTAS implementation:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"Working - 3 2 0\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/77486246/dbbb5919-44aa-4402-adb6-a4da74b8bda6\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn mllib module, the kMeansPlusPlus is a local method which run in a single thread.\r\nI use scala parallel collections to change the array to ParVector, which supports parallel calculating.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe kMeansPlusPlus method runs in spark driver in a single thread. \r\nIf the input vectors are very large, it will take a long time to calculate the distance between every points.\r\nIf we change this single-thread method to run in parallel, it will reduce a lot of time. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAll unit test cases

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince Spark does not support Hadoop2, we can merge the hadoop3-specific code into the standard maven project folders, which simplifies the `hadoop-cloud/pom.xml`\r\n\r\nI also checked and remove the unnecessary Hadoop related dependencies exclusions in `hadoop-cloud/pom.xml`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify Maven configuration files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\nCompare the dependency resolution, no change before and after this change.\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SparkConnectStreamHandler` treats the proto requests from connect client and send the responses back to connect client. `SparkConnectStreamHandler` holds a component `StreamObserver` to send responses.\r\nSo I think we should keep the `StreamObserver` could be accessed only with `SparkConnectStreamHandler`.\r\n\r\nThis PR want decouple the process handle commands and the other process send responses on server side.\r\nAfter this PR, we can remove `MockObserver` which seems is not useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecouple handle command and send response on server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

descriptor files for Protobuf files at build time. Removes manually generated `.desc` filed from test-resources directory.\r\n\r\nNote that Maven & SBT plugins generate descriptor files differently:\r\n  - Maven builds one descriptor file for each proto file (`catalyst_types.desc`, `functions_suite.desc` etc).\r\n     - This matches with manually generated file before this PR.  \r\n  - SBT plugin build single descriptor file for all the proto files.\r\nIt not feasible to change the behavior of either. So the tests work around it by picking either version of the descriptor file.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Existing tests are updated to use these files.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTypically, hive partition fields are created as string types.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE if not exists test_tb (\r\nid int\r\n)\r\nPARTITIONED BY (dt string)\r\n```\r\nHowever, cast data conversions are often introduced inadvertently during use. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from test_tb where dt=20230505;\r\n```\r\nit will prevent the condition `dt=20230505` from being pushed down into the metastore , because `20230505` is an IntegralType. And resulting in a request for all partitions from metastore.  This can affect execution performance in cases where the data table has very many partitions.\r\n\r\nSo, in the case of equivalent predicates, partition field pushdown should be supported.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs described above\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the approach of stripping the common part of candidate qualifiers in `StringUtils.orderSuggestedIdentifiersBySimilarity`:\r\n1. If all candidates have the same qualifier including namespace and table name, drop it. It should be dropped if the base string (unresolved attribute) doesn't include a namespace and table name. For example:\r\n    - `[ns1.table1.col1, ns1.table1.col2] -> [col1, col2]` for unresolved attribute `col0`\r\n    - `[ns1.table1.col1, ns1.table1.col2] -> [table1.col1, table1.col2]` for unresolved attribute `table1.col0`\r\n2. If all candidates belong to the same namespace, just drop it. It should be dropped for any non-fully qualified unresolved attribute. For example:\r\n    - `[ns1.table1.col1, ns1.table2.col2] -> [table1.col1, table2.col2]` for unresolved attribute `col0` or `table0.col0`\r\n    - `[ns1.table1.col1, ns1.table1.col2] -> [ns1.table1.col1, ns1.table1.col2]` for unresolved attribute `ns0.table0.col0`\r\n4. Otherwise take the suggested candidates AS IS.\r\n5. Sort the candidate list using the levenshtein distance. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should improve user experience with Spark SQL by simplifying the error message about an unresolved attribute.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes the error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisErrorSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n1. Assign a name to the error class, include:\r\n  - _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1254 -> UNSUPPORTED_OVERWRITE.PATH\r\n  - _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1315 -> UNSUPPORTED_OVERWRITE.TABLE\r\n\r\n2. Convert _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_0002 to INTERNAL_ERROR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The changes improve the error framework.\r\n- Because the subclass `SparkSqlAstBuilder` of `AstBuilder` has already override methods `visitInsertOverwriteDir` and `visitInsertOverwriteHiveDir`. In reality, `SparkSqlParser` is used in the Spark base code , and `SparkSqlAstBuilder` is used, The two exceptions mentioned above in AstBuilder will not be thrown through the user's perspective.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/88f69d6f92860823b1a90bc162ebca2b7c8132fc/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/SparkSqlParser.scala#L46-L47\r\n\r\n-

Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manual testing:\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DDLParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

It's important to keep the duplicated attributes to have the same id in the new instance, as column resolution allows more than one matching attribute if their ids are the same.\r\n\r\nFor example, `Project('a, CTERelationRef(a#1, a#1))` can be resolved properly as the matching attributes a have the same id, but `Project('a, CTERelationRef(a#2, a#3))` can't be resolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

But we hope we can load model without spark service. So we want the model being saved as the original binary format that our ML code can handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nAdded `copyFromLocalToFs` API:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def copyFromLocalToFs(self, local_path: str, dest_path: str) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        copy file from local to FS.\r\n\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        local_path: str\r\n            Path to a local file (Directory is not supported yet).\r\n            The path can be either absolute path or relative path.\r\n\r\n        dest_path: str\r\n            The FS path to the destination the file will be copied to.\r\n\r\n        .. versionadded:: 3.5.0\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

as (\r\n  select * from values (2, 3) as (c1, c2)\r\n)\r\nselect v1.c1, v1.c2, v2.c1, v2.c2, b\r\nfrom v1\r\nfull outer join v2\r\nusing (c1);\r\n```\r\nThe query should fail anyway, since `b` refers to a non-existent column. But it should fail with a helpful error message, not with a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\r\n\r\n`StringUtils#orderSuggestedIdentifiersBySimilarity` assumes that a list of suggested attributes with a mix of prefixes will never have an attribute name with an empty prefix. But in this case it does (`c1` from the `coalesce` has no prefix, since it is not associated with any relation or subquery):\r\n```\r\n+- 'Project [c1#5, c2#6, c1#7, c2#8, 'b]\r\n   +- Project [coalesce(c1#5, c1#7) AS c1#9, c2#6, c2#8] <== c1#9 has no prefix, unlike c2#6 (v1.c2) or c2#8 (v2.c2)\r\n      +- Join FullOuter, (c1#5 = c1#7)\r\n         :- SubqueryAlias v1\r\n         :  +- CTERelationRef 0, true, [c1#5, c2#6]\r\n         +- SubqueryAlias v2\r\n            +- CTERelationRef 1, true, [c1#7, c2#8]\r\n```\r\nBecause of this, `orderSuggestedIdentifiersBySimilarity` returns a sorted list of suggestions like this:\r\n```\r\nArrayBuffer(.c1, v1.c2, v2.c2)\r\n```\r\n`UnresolvedAttribute.parseAttributeName` chokes on an attribute name that starts with a '.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-28T23:37:20Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T20:40:25Z","closed_at":"2023-05-29T07:05:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e87dd87443cec567bb6087a8a6ea9a35357bb54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f8c04b7605d607a67e55d5ad828dd9a9a7ac916","head":{"label":"bersprockets:unresolved_column_issue","ref":"unresolved_column_issue","sha":"6f8c04b7605d607a67e55d5ad828dd9a9a7ac916","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror
