[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.8.0</h2>\n<h2>Go version support</h2>\n<h3>Support for Go 1.18</h3>\n<p>Version 0.8.0 of gopls supports features added to Go 1.18, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for multi-module workspaces using <code>go.work</code> files.</li>\n<li>Diagnostics for Fuzz tests.</li>\n<li>Improved support for generics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use these features, gopls must be installed using Go 1.18. See <a href=\"https://go.dev/dl/\">go.dev/dl</a> for the latest status of Go 1.18 -- as of writing Go 1.18 is not yet released, but Go 1.18 RC1 may be used.</p>\n<h3>Dropped support for Go 1.12</h3>\n<p>Version 0.8.0 of gopls no longer supports building at Go 1.12. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/50827\">golang/go#50827</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3><code>go.work</code> integration</h3>\n<p>Gopls now supports multi-module workspaces using <code>go.work</code> files. To use this feature, create a <code>go.work</code> file that includes the modules you want to work on, and then open your editor to the directory containing <code>go.work</code>.  For more information, see the  <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces\"><code>go.work</code> reference</a>, or the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/workspace.md\">gopls documentation</a> for multi-module workspaces.</p>\n<h3>Diagnostics for Fuzz tests</h3>\n<p>When writing <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/\">Fuzz tests</a>, gopls provides diagnostics for invalid arguments to <code>Fuzz</code>.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/156475335-0a277e11-c113-460a-837b-d066b42898a6.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h3>Improved support for generics</h3>\n<h4>Honor the language version configured in <code>go.mod</code></h4>\n<p>gopls now provides diagnostics for language features based on the <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-go\"><code>go</code> directive</a> in the applicable <code>go.mod</code> file for a package.</p>\n<p>For some errors related to incompatible language versions, gopls offers a quick-fix to update the <code>go.mod</code> Go version.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>gopls/v0.7.0</h1>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Postfix completions</h3>\n<p>Postfix completions are a new style of completions that can save you time by inserting more complex pieces of commonly-written code. All of the results end with <code>!</code>. This feature was added experimentally in <code>gopls/v0.6.10</code> and is now enabled by default.</p>\n<p>See this example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5856771/114612163-c5df9800-9c6f-11eb-959c-8fe529018a21.gif\" alt=\"ezgif-3-a82b2077ff38\" /></p>\n<h3>New commands: <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/commands.md#retrieves-a-list-of-packages\">List known packages</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/commands.md#asks-the-server-to-add-an-import-path-to-a-given-go-file\">add import</a></h3>\n<p>These commands can be used to manually list available packages to import and then add an import to your file. They are currently not used by any known clients, but they will be made available through the Command Palette in VS Code in the next VS Code Go release.</p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<h3>Memory usage</h3>\n<p>Improved trimming of the ASTs of dependency packages results in reduced memory usage, especially for projects with many dependencies. This may result in some hard-to-diagnose bugs that we're not yet aware of, so please report any surprising behavior via <a href=\"https://golang.org/issues/new\">https://golang.org/issues/new</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<p>A full list of all issues fixed can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/213?closed=1\">gopls/v0.7.0 milestone</a>.

reading string values via the OPC UA protocol a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` was thrown whenever the string contained non-ASCII characters. Upon further inspection, the problem could be pinned down to the logic in `readString()` of`ReadBufferByteBased`.\r\n\r\nThe `readString()` function in `ReadBufferByteBased` could result in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` upon calling `substring()`. Reason is that the calculated `realLength` is in bytes and the length of the created string is the number of characters. For UTF encodings, multiple bytes can be just one character. This causes `realLength` to be longer than the actual string and thus the `substring()`-call to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by applying `realLength` to the byte-length instead of the string length: The byte array is sliced to length `realLength` and then converted to the final string. `substring()` isn't used anymore.\r\nThe fix can be verified via the included regression test and has additionally been tested locally using the OPC UA protocol.\r\nMaybe other protocols were also affected?\r\n\r\nAdditionally I've included some other minor fixes for the logic. Check the commits for

2023)</h2>\n<p><strong>User-visible changes:</strong></p>\n<p>Fixed a bug in the Nullness Checker where a call to a side-effecting method did not make some formal parameters possibly-null.  The Nullness Checker is likely to issue more warnings for your code.  For ways to eliminate the new warnings, see <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#type-refinement-side-effects\">https://checkerframework.org/manual/#type-refinement-side-effects</a> .</p>\n<p>If you supply the <code>-AinvocationPreservesArgumentNullness</code> command-line option, the Nullness Checker unsoundly assumes that arguments passed to non-null parameters in an invocation remain non-null after the invocation.

release is support for web based applications.  You can now create applications that run in a browser, and display a simulated terminal emulator in the browser.  The initial implementation of this capability was supplied by <a href=\"https://github.com/Ahoys123\"><code>@​Ahoys123</code></a> -- thank you!  (We made some follow up bug fixes and improvements.)</p>\n<p>More detail about this mode can be found in the README-wasm.md file.</p>\n<p>Additionally we added support for alacritty-direct, which was contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/moson-mo\"><code>@​moson-mo</code></a>.</p>\n<p>This version is only tested on go 1.18 and newer.  Older versions of go <em>may</em> work, but might also fail, as our dependencies have started using newer compilation flags.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/c951371181bb4b1387d9010b8081590ae6a48152\"><code>c951371</code></a> minor style fixup</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/615b4b182194b6ebc8f04d6ba35c1fe37fab2514\"><code>615b4b1</code></a> fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/589\">#589</a> unexpected character linux console</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/7fe9d5fa9b715b1b25f71757c8e862ef9b2ba3ab\"><code>7fe9d5f</code></a> Webasm terminal fixes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/d78960c02d140502a6d1caa6993a18f60ca73b7c\"><code>d78960c</code></a> Color fixups.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/5db823e7a8fb079e5b5d723ef4c9cb9c30d0ff7b\"><code>5db823e</code></a> Better colors for mouse demo (brighter).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/7b5fe1f3ee14fcbec37f0f8b2d4708a9232baebc\"><code>7b5fe1f</code></a> Spelling.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/729d178abc68162ed6a80d6bb04ee62e056d57a1\"><code>729d178</code></a> Choose better fonts for web terminal.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/fade40c650ddc1c7d5104eecb98df9cadd2a2cef\"><code>fade40c</code></a> added to README-wasm.md</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/0851813f48a1ca0f27db47b0345a4dafb91a26c2\"><code>0851813</code></a> added js flag</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/b96a7ed4dc4d17d8cecca9d994b86dbcf61c3053\"><code>b96a7ed</code></a> removed js build flag in terms_static.go</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/compare/v2.5.4...v2.6.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=2.5.4&new-version=2.6.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

For example, to match by classname <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, use document.select(&quot;p.one\\.two&quot;);\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/838\">jhy/jsoup#838</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, wrap text that follows a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1858\">jhy/jsoup#1858</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, normalize newlines that follow self-closing tags in custom tags.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1852\">jhy/jsoup#1852</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, collapse non-significant whitespace between a block and an inline tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1802\">jhy/jsoup#1802</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#forEach and Node#forEachNode, use java.util.function.Consumer instead of the previous\nAndroid compatibility shim org.jsoup.helper.Consumer. Subsequently, the latter has been deprecated.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1870\">jhy/jsoup#1870</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#forms(), to conveniently retrieve a List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nelements in a document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#expectForm(query), to find the first matching FormElement, or blow up\ntrying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: URLs containing characters such as [ and ] were not escaped correctly, and would throw a\nMalformedURLException when fetched.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1873\">jhy/jsoup#1873</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: Element.cssSelector would create invalid selectors for elements where the tag name, ID, or classnames needed\nto be escaped (e.g. if a class name contained a ':' or '.').\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1742\">jhy/jsoup#1742</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: element.text() should have a space between a block and an inline element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1877\">jhy/jsoup#1877</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if a Node or an Element was replaced with itself, that node would incorrectly be orphaned.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1843\">jhy/jsoup#1843</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: form data on a previous request was copied to a new request in newRequest(), resulting in an accumulation of\nform data when executing multi-step form submissions, or data sent to later requests incorrectly. Now, newRequest()\nonly copies session related settings (cookies, proxy settings, user-agent, etc) but not the request data nor the\nbody.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778\">jhy/jsoup#1778</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>gopls/v0.6.0</h1>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Default to <code>-mod=readonly</code></h3>\n<p>In Go 1.16, the Go command will no longer modify user's <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> files automatically (<a href=\"https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16#tools\">https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16#tools</a>). In order to match this behavior, <code>gopls</code> now also uses <code>-mod=readonly</code> when running the <code>go</code> command. Any errors reported by the <code>go</code> command will be presented with a suggested fix to make the necessary fixes to your <code>go.mod</code> or <code>go.sum</code> files. As a consequence, your workspace may be in a partially broken state while you have errors in your <code>go.mod</code> or <code>go.sum</code> file. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/go/issues/42266\">golang/go#42266</a> will mitigate this, but it will likely not be resolved until February.</p>\n<p><strong>Not recommended</strong>: If you must opt out of this behavior, you can set the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#allowmodfilemodifications-bool\"><code>allowModfileModifications</code></a> configuration to <code>true</code>.</p>\n<h3>Default to <code>GOPROXY=off</code></h3>\n<p><code>gopls</code> no longer accesses the network implicitly. This should improve latency in all cases, but it also means that <code>gopls</code> will no longer automatically download modules that are not found in your local module cache. The one exception is that <code>gopls</code> will still download dependencies on start-up, so it will continue to work as expected if you have cloned a repository for the first time. If <code>gopls</code> detects a missing module, it will offer you a suggested fix that downloads it.</p>\n<p><strong>Not recommended</strong>: If you must opt out of this behavior, you can set the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#allowimplicitnetworkaccess-bool\"><code>allowImplicitNetworkaccess</code></a> configuration to <code>true</code>.</p>\n<h3>Inclusion/exclusion filters for directories</h3>\n<p><code>gopls</code> now supports excluding certain directories in your workspace from analysis. This may be useful if you are only working on a subset of a large repository. Note that these filters are not propagated to the <code>go</code> command, so <code>gopls</code> will still load metadata for these directories, which may be expensive. <strong>Configure the included/excluded directories through the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#directoryfilters-string\"><code>directoryFilters</code></a> setting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Debouncing for diagnostics</h3>\n<p>Diagnostics are now reported instantly only for the packages currently being edited. Diagnostics for other packages in the workspace will now only be computed after 250 milliseconds, meaning that, if you are actively typing, <code>gopls</code> will not start these more costly operations. This should significantly reduce CPU utilization. This debounce delay can be optionally configured via the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#experimentaldiagnosticsdelay-timeduration\"><code>experimentalDiagnosticsDelay</code></a> setting.</p>\n<h3>&quot;Upgrade direct dependencies&quot; code lens</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.5.4\"><code>gopls/v0.5.4</code></a>, we removed the per-require &quot;Upgrade dependency&quot; code lens, as it was very high latency, and its UX did not meet user needs. Some users have expressed disappointment about this, so, to bridge the gap, we have separated the existing &quot;Upgrade all dependencies&quot; code lens into two: &quot;Upgrade transitive dependencies&quot; and &quot;Upgrade direct dependencies&quot;. The first is the equivalent of running <code>go get -u all</code>, while the second <code>go get</code>s each of your module's requires independently. We are continuing to work on improving these features and will likely bring back the &quot;Upgrade dependency&quot; code lens as a suggested fix (learn more: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/go/issues/38339\">golang/go#38339</a>).</p>\n<h3>Support for filling a partially-populated struct</h3>\n<p>The &quot;Fill struct&quot; suggested fix will now be suggested for structs that have some, but not all, fields set.</p>\n<h3>Experimental</h3>\n<h4>Field alignment analyzer</h4>\n<p>A new analyzer has been added to suggest reordering fields in a struct in order to achieve the optimal alignment in memory. It is still off by default, but can be enabled by adding the following to your <code>gopls</code> settings:</p>\n<pre lang=\"json5\"><code>&quot;analyses&quot;: {\t\t\n\t&quot;fieldalignment&quot;: true\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<h3>Improvements to diagnostics tracking</h3>\n<p>Diagnostic messages were not being updated correctly when the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#codelenses-mapstringbool\"><code>GC details</code></a> code lens was toggled on. New handling to differentiate diagnostics by sources should have resolved this issue.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
