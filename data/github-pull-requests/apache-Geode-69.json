when --categories is provided.\r\n\r\n* The ShowMetricsCommand has been almost entirely refactored, but with minimal change to existing behavior.\r\n* The category \"cache-server\" has been renamed to \"cacheserver\"\r\n* The \"query\" category now only lists once instead of twice.\r\n* Category checking is now performed by the client, not the server.\r\n* Expand test coverage\r\n* Associated help updated and corrected.\r\n* Remove unused categories from listing\r\n* Alphabetized excludedClasses.txt\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI realize the alphabetization of `excludedClasses.txt` is well beyond the scope of this ticket, but it seemed harmless at the time.  I can revert that change to a one-line addition if that is the desire of the community.  Or I could open a new ticket and address it in that.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is contains a behavior change in that `--categories=cache-server` was a valid option that should now be expressed as `--categories=cacheserver`.  For the sake and stability of using an `Enum`, the dash is prohibited.  A special case could be added to allow this legacy behavior to remain, stripping hyphens from the input string, but that seemed to be more special-case handling than was warranted.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

backup oplog files (#963)\r\n    \r\n    * Oplog files that are backed up are read-only. For this reason,\r\n      they can be transfered to the backup location through hard links,\r\n      instead of copying the file. This change improves speed of backups.\r\n      If the creation of a hard link fails, we revert to the existing copy\r\n      behavior.\r\n    * During backups, the copying of the oplog's krf file was being done while\r\n      that file could still be in the process of writing. This change ensures\r\n      that if a krf is to be written, that it is finished and included in the\r\n      backup\r\n    * cleanup existing oplog

I can't decide if I'm over-engineering the test by including both the `--full` and `--full=true` options when trying to test that functionality.  On the one hand, if we accept it, I feel like we should test it.  On the other hand, command-line option parsing seems more to belong to Spring than to Geode.\r\n\r\n(2) While I was dealing with versioning, I decided to remove one of the lingering references to GemFire.  It was wider-reaching than I had realized, so I'm currently on the fence whether or not it's small a trivial enough of a change to be included in this ticket as opposed to another \"remove references to GemFire\" ticket.  I have left these commits un-squashed for the time being for ease of review and, potentially, reversion.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
