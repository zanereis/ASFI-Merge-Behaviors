PR fixes #23541\r\n \r\nPR [22718](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/22718) updated the behavior of BigQueryIO **read** and **readTableRows** API where it uses both the Avro writer and reader schema to decode BigQuery elements. However, before this change, these APIs only relied on the writer schema to deserialize elements. The issue with using reader schema is that its derived via the `BigQueryAvroUtils.toGenericAvroSchema` function that does not correctly handle _TableFieldSchema -> Avro schema_ conversion for Avro schemas containing LogicalTypes.\r\n\r\nR: @steveniemitz \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

work related to reducing Go SDK harness grpc congestion https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23335: Single flight GetProcessBundleDescriptor requests.\r\n\r\nBundleDescriptors IDs in a given worker are identical, so it's wasteful to fetch the same one repeatedly from the runner. The descriptor could be large, or requested hundreds of times, and the previous implementation would simply request them all if it weren't already cached. \r\n\r\nUsing https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/singleflight we can key off the bundleDescriptorID, and only make a single request at a time for a given bundleDescriptorID. They'll all block on the same response, and then be unlocked to construct their independent plan instances.\r\n\r\nThis reduces lock contention on writing to the descriptor map as well, by moving that into the inflight section.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21458\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21671\r\n\r\nThis PR covers\r\n\r\n1. Python 3.10 tests and infrastructure.\r\n2. replace `_unified_repr()` with `repr()`. Fixed the tests related to `_unified_repr()` Fixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/20982\r\n3. Some tests were meant to be run on Dataflow runner v1 when it was the default runner for Dataflow. But Runner v2 has been added as default so we need to explicitly add `--experiments=disable_runner_v2` or `--dataflow_service_option=disable_runner_v2`. Added this flag to dataflow runner v1 tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Also, dataflow runner v1 is not supported yet with Python 3.10. Please use runner_v2 for the Dataflow jobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Resolves #23420\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Introduces [app_state](https://pub.dev/packages/app_state) for navigation and state management.\r\n- Loads and shows a selected unit's content.\r\n- Removes `SdkModel` in favor of `Sdk` from `playground_components`.\r\n\r\nThis is the ToB frontend that was screen-casted on the Sep 30 meeting. The only change is that we show empty Playground for units that have no snippets.\r\n\r\nThis cannot run with the production backend because this relies on 'Share my code' feature which is not deployed to production.\r\n\r\nIf there are minor issues here we still prefer this merged so they can be fixed in further tasks. We need this to unlock Darkhan so he can work on fonts, colors, indents etc.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#19967\r\nfixes #19967\r\n\r\n~This should be reviewed after~ https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26117 ✅ \r\n\r\n## Design decisions\r\n\r\n- Previous version of the consumer stores `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` in checkpoints for both non- and aggregated records, and, in fact, starts `AT` all the time, compensating with `RecordFilter`. EFO consumer implements the same semantic for executing first subscription request. This is to be re-visited in https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26073\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/26117:\r\n\r\n- Maintained serialisation compatibility of `KinesisReaderCheckpoint` with Beam 2.46.0\r\n- Broken serialisation compatibility with Beam 2.46.0 for `KinesisIO.Read` and `KinesisSource` - this is confirmed for Flink runner, but may affect other runners as well, if they serialise these objects as parts of their checkpoint / savepoint. Unfortunately, `KinesisIO.Read` and its auto-generated counterpart had different default `serialVersionUID`, and it's impossible to keep them when we add `withConsumerArn()` option.\r\n\r\n## How this change was tested\r\n\r\nWith Flink runner - Flink 1.15.2, Java 11:\r\n- shard-up (up to 48 shards) and shard-down (down to 1)\r\n- failing pipelines (test recovery from some errors)\r\n- pipelines with slow processing (testing back-pressure)\r\n- start with a savepoint from previous Beam release (simulate Beam version upgrade)\r\n- start previous Beam release with a savepoint from new code (simulate Beam version downgrade)\r\n\r\nPlayground repo: https://github.com/psolomin/beam-playground/tree/master/kinesis-io-with-enhanced-fan-out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[google.golang.org/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) from 1.49.0 to 1.50.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.50.0</h2>\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>client: use proper &quot;@&quot; semantics for connecting to abstract unix sockets. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5678\">#5678</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>This is technically a bug fix; the result is that the address was including a trailing NULL byte, which it should not have.  This may break users creating the socket in Go by prefixing a NULL instead of an &quot;@&quot;, though, so calling it out as a behavior change.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/jachor\"><code>@​jachor</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>metadata: add experimental <code>ValueFromIncomingContext</code> to more efficiently retrieve a single value (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5596\">#5596</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a

href=\"https://github.com/feihu-stripe\"><code>@​feihu-stripe</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>xds: add support for Outlier Detection, enabled by default (<a

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5652\">#5652</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>This should only occur with an HTTP/2 server that does not follow best practices of an advisory GOAWAY (not a grpc-go server).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>xds/xdsclient: fix a bug which was causing routes with <code>cluster_specifier_plugin</code> set to be NACKed when GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_RLS_LB was off (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5670\">#5670</a>)</li>\n<li>xds/xdsclient: NACK cluster resource if <code>config_source_specifier</code> in

LB policy from retrying connection attempts (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5601\">#5601</a>)</li>\n<li>xds/ringhash: do nothing when asked to exit <code>IDLE</code> instead of falling back on the default channel behavior of connecting to all addresses (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5614\">#5614</a>)</li>\n<li>xds/rls: fix a bug which was causing the channel to be stuck in <code>IDLE</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5656\">#5656</a>)</li>\n<li>alts: fix a bug which was setting <code>WaitForReady</code> on handshaker service RPCs, thereby delaying fallback when required (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/5620\">#5620</a>)</li>\n<li>gcp/observability: fix End() to cleanup global state correctly (<a

PR renames the Playground's `clean` Gradle task to `cleanFlutter` so it does not automatically start when `clean` is run in all sub-projects.\r\n\r\nA task `flutterClean` in another component is also

#21349\r\n\r\nAdding information to [Using the Direct Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/) page:\r\n\r\nThe Direct Runner is not designed for production pipelines, because it’s optimized for correctness rather than performance. The Direct Runner must fit all user data in memory, whereas the Flink and Spark runners can spill data to disk if it doesn’t fit in memory. Consequently, Flink and Spark runners are able to run larger pipelines and are better suited to production workloads.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds watermark estimation to Periodic impulse so that it can keep up during streaming jobs. Without this, it never advances its watermark and thus can never emit any aggregation.\r\n\r\nI was able to test this against a pipeline that did `periodic impulse every second` -> `10 second window` -> `aggregation` -> `log results`. Without my changes, this never logged anything. After my changes, it logged every 10 seconds like it should.\r\n\r\nFixes #23763\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR aims to illustrates an example of setting up a real time text anomaly detection pipeline using PubSub  and RunInference.\r\n\r\nThe entire implementation is divided into two different pipelines:\r\n\r\n1. `write_data_to_pubsub_pipeline` pushes data to PubSub\r\n2. `anomaly_detection_pipeline` reads data from PubSub, uses a trained HDBSCAN model and does anomaly detection.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

were estimating backlog bytes on all types of change stream records, but the only ones that contributed to the pipeline throughput were the data change records. This caused an issue when throughput was 0, but the backlog bytes were > 0 due to heartbeat records, preventing a downscale event in autoscaling.\r\n\r\nIn this change we only report the data change records bytes in the get size function, such that when throughput is 0, even if we were receiving heartbeat or child partition records the backlog bytes would remain at 0.\r\n\r\nFixes

This usually [stems from a permissions error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70435286/resource-not-accessible-by-integration-on-github-post-repos-owner-repo-ac), I'm guessing this is due to some sort of token scoping change, and am hoping explicitly granting the correct permissions will solve it.
