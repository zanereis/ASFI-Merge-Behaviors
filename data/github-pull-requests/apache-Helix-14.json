Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#555 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- Use a dry-run rebalancer to avoid updating the persisted rebalancer status in the verifiers or test cases.\r\n- Also, refine several rebalancer related interfaces so as to simplify the dry-run rebalancer implementation.\r\n- Convert the test cases back to use the BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier.\r\n\r\n- Additional fixing:\r\n1. Updating the rebalancer preference on every rebalancer.compute calls. Since the preference might be updated at runtime.\r\n2. Fix one minor metric domain bug in the WagedRebalancerMetricCollector.\r\n3. Minor test case fix to make them more stable after the change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestWagedRebalance.testNewInstances()\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:128 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestZKUtil.testChildrenOperations:78 expected:<2> but was:<3>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:63->setupTasks:115 NullPointer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1045, Failures: 6, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n\r\nRe-run\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 40, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 37.385 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 40, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor the WAGED rebalancer, we persist the cluster's mapping via AssignmentMetadataStore every pipeline. However, if there are no changes made to the new assignment from the old assignment, this write is not necessary.

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe rebalance has been modified to be a thread-local object. So there is no need to keep the change detector as thread-local. This may cause a potential problem.\r\nIn addition, in order to avoid resource leakage, implement the finalize method of the WagedRebalancer to close all connections.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestWagedRebalancer\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp Â» ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestAssignableInstanceManager.testGetAssignableInstanceMap:114 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<RUNNING>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1045, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRurun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 38.752 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #529 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZKBucketDataAccessor has a GC logic, but this is only valid if the ZkClient inside it is active and not closed. Currently, WAGED rebalancer generates an instance of AssignmentMetadataStore every time it rebalances, which does not allow the internal ZkBucketDataAccessor to garbage collect the assignment metadata it wrote previously.\r\n\r\nThis diff makes the entire WagedRebalancer object a ThreadLocal, which has the effect of making it essentially static across different runs of the pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover the correctness of this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#518 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdjust the replica rebalance calculating ordering to avoid static order.\r\n\r\nThe problem of a static order is that the same set of replicas will always be the ones that are moved or state transited during the rebalance.\r\nThis randomize won't change the algorithm's performance. But it will help the Helix to eliminate very unstable partitions.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<RUNNING>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1045, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 24.373 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code

the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\nSubject is separated from body by a blank line\r\nSubject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that sometimes during shutdown/disconnect, this reset() gets called, and due to the partition having been dropped right around the same time, we get an NPE on the state model. Added a null check.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo test needed since it's a simple null check.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nDid build instead.\r\n-----------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:23 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-10-22T10:57:36-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#518 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRefactor soft constraints to simply the algorithm and fix potential issues.\r\n1. Check for zero weight so as to avoid unnecessary calculations.\r\n2. Simply the soft constraint interfaces and implementations. Avoid duplicate code.\r\n3. Adjust partition movements constraint logic to reduce the chance of moving partition when the baseline and best possible assignment diverge.\r\n4. Estimate utilization in addition to the other usage estimation. The estimation will be used as a base when calculating the capacity usage score. This is to ensure the algorithm treats different clusters with different overall usage in the same way.\r\n5. Fix the issue that high utilization calculation does not consider the current proposed replica usage.\r\n6. Use Sigmoid to calculate usage-based soft constraints score. This enhances the assignment result of the algorithm.\r\n7. Adjust the related test cases.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAll the constraint-based algorithm tests have been modified based on the change.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.beforeTest:303->enableInstance:314 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestDelayedWagedRebalanceWithDisabledInstance>TestDelayedAutoRebalance.afterClass:331 » NullPointer\r\n[ERROR]   TestStopWorkflow.testStopTask » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng.internal.TestN...\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1046, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 14\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRe-run:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 21, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 129.934 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 21, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#518 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRefine the rebalance scope calculating logic in the WAGED rebalancer.\r\n1. Ignore the IdealState mapping/listing fields if the resource is in FULL_AUTO mode.\r\n2. On IdealState change, the resource shall be fully rebalanced since some filter conditions might be changed. Such as instance tag.\r\n3. Live instance change (node newly connected) shall trigger full rebalance so partitions will be re-assigned to the new node.\r\n4. A new baseline calculation no longer triggers all the replicas in the cluster to be rebalanced by default. The partial rebalance method will determine the scope based on the real change type.\r\n5. Modify the related test cases.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe changed logic is covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<RUNNING>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1043, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun and these 3 tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#515)\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nImplement the propertyStore read endpoint \r\nExample: http://xxxx/clusters/TestCluster/propertyStore/*<PATH>*\r\n- The read method accepts a simple path parameter called \"path\" of the format \"abc/abc/abc\"\r\n- The path is validated using regex\r\n- The read operation parses the byte array content from a static bytearray zk base data accessor, if it's ZNRecord format, return ZnRecord; Otherwise, return {\"content\": <payload>}\r\n\r\nSample curl tests:\r\n```\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8100/admin/v2/clusters/TestCluster/propertyStore/dummy\" -X GET\r\n{\r\n  \"/TestCluster/PROPERTYSTORE/dummy\" : \"dummyContent\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8100/admin/v2/clusters/TestCluster/propertyStore/empty\" -X GET   \r\n{\r\n  \"/TestCluster/PROPERTYSTORE/empty\" : \"\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8100/admin/v2/clusters/TestCluster/propertyStore/znrecord\" -X GET\r\n{\r\n  \"id\" : \"TestCluster\",\r\n  \"simpleFields\" : {\r\n  },\r\n  \"mapFields\" : {\r\n  },\r\n  \"listFields\" : {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8100/admin/v2/clusters/TestCluster/propertyStore/nonexist\" -X GET\r\nThe property store path /TestCluster/PROPERTYSTORE/nonexist doesn't exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestPropertyStoreAccessor\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 90, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe WAGED rebalancer returns the previously calculated assignment on calculation failure\r\nThis is to protect the cluster assignment on a rebalancing algorithm failure. For example, the cluster is out of capacity. In this case, the rebalancer will keep using the previously calculated mapping.\r\nAlso, add the RebalanceFailureCount metric for recording the failures.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew test cases to TestWagedRebalancer\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect:174->checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 » Helix Failed to ...\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskRebalancer.timeouts:199 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<INIT>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1044, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 4\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRe-run\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 13, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 58.973 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 13, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code

commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\nSubject is separated from body by a blank line\r\nSubject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n  In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x]  My diff

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#508\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMore strict partition weight validation while creating the cluster model.\r\n1. If any capacity key is not configured in the Resource Config (or default weight) as the partition weight, the config is invalid.\r\n2. If any partition weight is configured with a negative number, the config is invalid.\r\nNote that the rebalancer will not compute a new assignment if any capacity/weight config is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis change is based on our discussion with potential customers. The expectation is to try our best to avoid confusing rebalance behavior.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestAssignableReplica\r\nTestClusterConfig\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect:174->checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<RUNNING>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1044, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 4\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRe-run\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.022 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#402 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    1. Fix the DelayedAutoRebalancer Cache issue that ClusterConfig change won't trigger rebalance. The current workaround in our code blocks the WAGED rebalancer logic. So we need to fix it while merging the WAGED rebalancer code.\r\n    2. Refine the ResourceChangeDetector's usage in the WAGED rebalancer so as to avoid unnecessary global rebalance.\r\n    3. Extend the StrictMatchExternalViewVerifier so it can be used to test the WAGED rebalance feature.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo new test classes. New changes are covered by the modified test logic.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:73 expected:<COMPLETED> but was:<RUNNING>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1038, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 37.824 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #461 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis commit specifically targets the scenario where there is massive participant disconnections.\r\nHere a new check has been added to avoid the tasks to be assigned right away to the old instance after participant disconnection and mastership handoff. The tasks will be considered as dropped and re-assigned in next pipeline to the correct instances.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nNote: This part of the code cannot be reproduced using any tests.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#402\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure the maintenance mode rebalance logic keeps the same.\r\n2. Ensure the WAGED rebalancer treats the topology definition the same as other rebalancers.\r\n3. Minor adjust the constraint based algorithm normalization factor to ensure the rebalance preference config works as expected. The movement weight was too heavy, so without this change, no movement happens for evenness. And the migration tests will fail.\r\n4. Adding tests to cover all the existing features, such as migration and node swap.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestWagedExpandCluster\r\nTestWagedRebalancerMigration\r\nTestNodeSwap\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nObviously, tests are still not quite stable with the change.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/wiki/Weight-aware-Globally-Evenly-distributed-Rebalancer\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Jira issue reference)\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n  In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x]  My diff

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#482)\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\nPros:\r\nThe function squashes any x > 0 to a normalized range between (0, 1]\r\nWhen x limits to 0, the f(x) = 1\r\nNo need to give any estimations about max capacity, max allowed partitions count, etc\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- It adds one additional parameter \\alpha f(x) = tanh(1/(\\alpha * x))\r\nthat changes the slope of plot function; Needs to tune the parameter as well as the weight importances between soft constraints\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe tool leverages standalone ZK, Helix controller which run locally to simulate the rebalance process.\r\nThe tool also initializes mock participant threads for simulation state transitions.\r\nAfter each operation, the tool will print the current cluster status and all state transitions happen after the previous print out.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x]  My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n#483 Fix RoutingDataCache always does full refresh for current state.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x]  Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n#483 Fix RoutingDataCache always does full refresh for current state.\r\nIf a current state changes, propertyDataMap doesn't mark current state type not to do full refresh next time. This causes current state refresh to always do full refresh. And this increases snapshot read latency. So we need to mark propertyDataMap's current state type to false, NOT requiring full refresh next time.\r\n\r\nAnd for live instance changes, we need to mark propertyDataMap's current state to true, requiring current state full refresh next time.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x]  The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestRoutingDataCache.testCurrentStatesSelectiveUpdate\r\n\r\n- [x]  The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect:174->checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestPartitionLevelTransitionConstraint.test:173 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection:140 » Helix Workflow \"testLostZkConn...\r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 » Helix Failed to ...\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 882, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  57:51 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-18T17:51:09-07:00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.925 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  11.178 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-19T09:27:36-07:00\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3.92 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestAlertingRebalancerFailure\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  8.357 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-19T09:26:43-07:00\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 16.092 s - in org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestTaskPerformanceMetrics\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  20.176 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-19T09:28:14-07:00\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.066 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestPartitionLevelTransitionConstraint\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  10.440 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-19T09:29:22-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x]  My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #467 and #377 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was observed that sometimes CustomRebalancer would leave out an instance entirely if an instance is disabled or the partition on the instance was still bootstrapping (current state is null). This would cause a cluster not to converge. \r\n\r\nThis diff fixes this by 1) still including an assignment from IdealState even though the current state is null (maybe due to a pending state transition) 2) putting disabled partitions in InitialState.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n**TestCustomRebalancer**\r\n\r\nThis problem was originally reported by Apache Pinot. **Ran the following test repeatedly several hundred times for 10+ hours without failure**.\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 16.313 sec - in **org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.ControllerInstanceToggleTest**\r\ntestInstanceToggle(org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.ControllerInstanceToggleTest)  Time elapsed: 7.004 sec\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.7.201606060606:report-aggregate (report) @ pinot-controller ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulee/mp/incubator-pinot/pinot-controller/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  28.132 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-12T08:44:24-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testTagSetIncorrect(org.apache.helix.integration.TestAlertingRebalancerFailure)  Time elapsed: 180.085 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState(TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.java:310)\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect(TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.java:174)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect:174->checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 854, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  56:35 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-15T19:45:48-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4.234 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestAlertingRebalancerFailure\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  9.046 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-15T23:08:35-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#402\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe rebalancer should determine the expected replica count according to the fault zone instead of the node count only.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified the existing cluster model tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nNA, will run mvn test if check-in after the integration PR submitted.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n * Evaluate the proposed assignment according to the potential partition movements cost.\r\n * The cost is evaluated based on the difference between the old assignment and the new assignment.\r\n * In detail, we consider the following two previous assignments as the base.\r\n * - Baseline assignment that is calculated regardless of the node state (online/offline).\r\n * - Previous Best Possible assignment.\r\n * Any change to these two assignments will increase the partition movements cost, so that the\r\n * evaluated score will become lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #467 and #377 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously, CustomRebalancer would cache the result of the previous best possible mapping and use it and skip the whole calculation step. For the users of CustomRebalancer, this was causing the cluster to not converge intermittently. This is because the rebalancer should recompute the best possible mapping upon cluster change, but it was not doing so for changes like CurrentState and Message changes.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Enhance logging in CustomRebalancer\r\n2. Create a boolean result for CurrentState refresh and message refresh so that the controller could record the changeType\r\n3. Clear cached resource assignments upon refresh so that appropriate messages would be generated to make the cluster converge\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThis problem was originally reported by Apache Pinot. **Ran the following test repeatedly several hundred times for 10+ hours without failure**.\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 16.313 sec - in **org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.ControllerInstanceToggleTest**\r\ntestInstanceToggle(org.apache.pinot.controller.helix.ControllerInstanceToggleTest)  Time elapsed: 7.004 sec\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n08:44:21.209 zk.zookeeper.ZkClient: (Thread 22) - zookeeper state changed (Disconnected)\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.7.7.201606060606:report-aggregate (report) @ pinot-controller ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/hulee/mp/incubator-pinot/pinot-controller/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  28.132 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-12T08:44:24-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 854, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  54:12 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-12T11:25:21-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #459 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix TestWagedRebalancer and add constructor in AssignmentMetadataStore\r\n\r\nTestWagedRebalancer was failing because it was not using a proper HelixManager to instantiate a mock version of AssignmentMetadataStore. This diff refactors the constructors in AssignmentMetadataStore and fixes the failing test.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.waged.TestWagedRebalancer\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.661 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.waged.TestWagedRebalancer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  4.991 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-10T09:47:28-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#441\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCompare the configure items with the required capacity keys that are defined in the cluster config when build the assignable instances.\r\n- According to the design, all the required capacity keys must appear in the instance capacity config.\r\n- As for the partition weights, the corresponding weight item will be filled with value 0 if the required capacity key is not specified in the resource config.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified the test cases in TestAssignableNode and TestAssignableReplica for the new validation.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRun all the WAGED rebalancer related tests. The code has not been connected with the other Helix component yet. So no need to run all mvn tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/wiki/Weight-aware-Globally-Evenly-distributed-Rebalancer\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-05T17:49:37Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T02:17:24Z","closed_at":"2019-09-07T02:17:20Z","merged_at":"2019-09-07T02:17:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"0fa347dc23c21597d7b4f65f658031e6e123fc7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7333ae42b774f8b1f79f1601663c790abdbc9ed5","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:capacity","ref":"capacity","sha":"7333ae42b774f8b1f79f1601663c790abdbc9ed5","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#421)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n**Least Used Instance Soft Constraint** \r\nThe constraint measures the current usages of partitions on the instance versus the estimated max allowed partitions. \r\nIntuitively, we need to give a low score (discourage) if the # of partitions gets closer to upper bound; Give a high score (encourage) if # of partitions is way below the upper bound;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\nunit test added for the class\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x]  My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nIt's just some simple refactoring works that make the HelixRestServer look cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x]  Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\nWhat - https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/427  Delete unused default namespace. Api endpoint \"/namespaces/default\" will be disabled and deleted. \r\n\r\nWhy - We have namespace api: /admin/v2/namespaces/{namespace}/.  However, the /namespaces/default path is not in use. We need to delete this.\r\n\r\nHow - On the code level, if there is not a default namespace, we won't create a DEFAULT_SERVLET. On the app/MP level, we can configure MP not to add name \"default\" namespace.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x]  The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\ntestDefaultNamespaceDisabled\r\n\r\n- [x]  The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\nmvn test in helix-rest.\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 84, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 22.631 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 84, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  27.788 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-09-04T21:25:44-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x]  My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\nSubject is separated from body by a blank line\r\nSubject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\nSubject does not end with a period\r\nSubject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\nBody wraps at 72 characters\r\nBody explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n  In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x]  My diff

appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #424 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that sometimes the tasks' NUM_ATTEMPTS field in JobContext was getting incremented even without the tasks being retried. This was because the numAttempts field was getting incremented in other (incorrect) places than at scheduling time. The logic for incrementing the number of attempts has been moved to the schedule logic in this diff.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Modify tests so that they test for numAttempts more tightly\r\n2. Fix the incrementation logic\r\n3. Add a new integration test: TestTaskNumAttempts\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestIndependentTaskRebalancer\r\n\r\nTestTaskConditionalRetry\r\n\r\nTestTaskRebalancer\r\n\r\nTestTaskRebalancerRetryLimit\r\n\r\nTestUnregisteredCommand\r\n\r\n**TestTaskNumAttempts** (new addition)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 845, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,092.266 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 845, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using
