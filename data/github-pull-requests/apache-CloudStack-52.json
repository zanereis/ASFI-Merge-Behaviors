there have been two threads asking and discussing the “midonet” integration with Apache CloudStack (ACS) [1-2].\r\n\r\nAfter quite some discussions, we noticed that despite having some people willing to use it, the plugin has never been fully developed by its vendor (Midokura). Further, nobody else has put the effort on fully testing and finishing its implementation. It seems that the plugin was incorporated into our code base without being fully finished. Moreover, I have asked around at the Midonet community, and the java client they use has changed quite a bit from the one we use.\r\n\r\nIt begs the question if it does not work, why do we advertise such integration? [3]. \r\nFollowing the component retirement process defined in [4], a vote thread was started in [5]. The community decided to retire this Midonet plugin. This task represents the first step of the retirement, which is the disabling of the plugin in CloudStack`s build process.\r\n \r\n[1]

Primary Storage resource counts is considered twice: Once while creating the volume and next while attaching it. This results in failure while Attaching the volume, if the primary storage resource limit is set.\r\n\r\n**Following are the steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. Create a Domain\r\n2. Create an Account.\r\n3. Allocate 11 GB Primary storage limit to the domain.\r\n4. Deploy a VM sized 8GB (Primary storage resource count is now 8GB )\r\n5. Create a 2GB custom disk by using the option 'Add Volume' link.(Primary storage resource count is now 10GB). The Volume state is 'Allocated'\r\n6. Now try to Attach the data-disk created above to a VM. At this point the resource count limit is again checked, and the attachment fails, because it is expected to be 12GB, but, which exceeds the limit of 11GB.\r\n7. This issue is also observed for volumes which are 'Detached'. On detaching an attached volume, the state is still seen as 'Ready'. When such a \r\nvolume is tried to attach again, it will fail as the resource limit will be checked again.\r\n\r\n**Fix implemented:**\r\n1. When a volume is ‘Added’, its state is seen as ‘Allocated’ and it utilizes the primary storage resource. When the Volume in ‘Allocated’ state is attached to a VM, its state changes to ‘Ready’.\r\n2. When the volume is detached from the VM, its state is still seen as ‘Ready’. When the volume is detached, the resources (primary storage) are not released, because the volume is still in primary storage. \r\n3. The fix is to skip checking the resource limit when the volume state is either 'Allocated' or 'Ready'. Because the volume state being 'Allocated' or 'Ready' implies that it is already on the Primary storage and hence the limit should not be checked again.\r\n\r\n**Test Results:**\r\n1. Set a limit of 42 GB primary storage to a new domain \r\n2. Deployed a 30GB VM in it. \r\n3. Created a 10 GB disk and could attach and detach it multiple times without any error of resource limit.","created_at":"2017-03-07T11:58:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T05:41:50Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T05:41:50Z","merged_at":"2017-05-16T05:41:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b0e67502c49a8b3adbf06dc2a4c4788686d9f48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2/labels","id":2457914,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNA==","number":2,"title":"4.10.0.0","description":"4.10.0.0

offers investigation, fencing and recovery mechanisms for host that for\r\nany reason are malfunctioning. It uses Activity and Health checks to determine\r\ncurrent host state based on which it may degrade a host or try to recover it. On\r\nfailing to recover it, it may try to fence the host.\r\n\r\nThe core feature is implemented in a hypervisor agnostic way, with two separate\r\nimplementations of the driver/provider for Simulator and KVM hypervisors. The\r\nframework also allows for implementation of other hypervisor specific provider\r\nimplementation in future.\r\n\r\nThe Host-HA provider implementation for KVM hypervisor uses the out-of-band\r\nmanagement sub-system to issue IPMI calls to reset (recover) or poweroff (fence)\r\na host.\r\n\r\nThe Host-HA provider implementation for Simulator provides a means of testing \r\nand validating the core framework implementation.\r\n\r\nFS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Host+HA\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Abhinandan Prateek

change removes the conversion from IPNetwork to list in one of the router scripts. This makes the router faster at processing static NAT rules, which can prevent timeouts when attaching or detaching IPs.\r\n\r\nWith the `list` conversion, it has to potentially check a list of 65536 IP strings multiple times. We assume that the comparison implemented in the IPNetwork is far more efficient. We have seen speed-up from 218 seconds to enable static NAT with 18 IPs on the router to 2 or 3 seconds by removing this cast. This also fixes a potential bug where adding IPs to a router time out because the scripts are taking too long. 218 seconds, for example, is beyond the timeout on the KVM agent for script execution, and then all enableStaticNat operations will fail.","created_at":"2017-02-17T09:26:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T09:50:33Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T00:04:25Z","merged_at":"2017-02-28T00:04:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5c5eb10f8a4fb80aa8b9182290948755cdd6026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d5c5eb10f8a4fb80aa8b9182290948755cdd6026","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-faster-static-nats","ref":"pr-faster-static-nats","sha":"d5c5eb10f8a4fb80aa8b9182290948755cdd6026","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d84347ba8c623293d14ed50fb3c6e06f1fefbd28","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

forces the network type (nw_type) of the IP address being sent into router configuration scripts to be lowercase. All of the Python config scripts on the router explicitly look for network type \"public\" with a lowercase P. Sending \"Public\" with an uppercase P can cause important iptables rules to not be created, meaning that public networking won't work.\r\n\r\nWe discovered this while applying the other fix for CLOUDSTACK-9339 to our own 4.7 branch, and then checked master and saw that it hadn't been changed yet. The fix is very simple: force the network type to lowercase when creating IpAssoc config items. Without this fix, iptables rules for public IPs that are added in `CsAddress.py` would get skipped, and traffic into instances on interfaces other than eth2 would not
