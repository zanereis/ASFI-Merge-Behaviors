Description ##\r\nThe `restricted-website-build-master` pipeline is failing due to files not found issue: https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-website-build-master/activity. The pipeline fails after https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19743 got merged. Building the static website locally, I find that the license header at the top of `blog.html`, `ecosystem.html` and `features.html` stop the pages from building. After moving the header to a lower section, I am able to build all three pages locally.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the website build pipeline by relocating the license header, and also revert the previous PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19901 that failed to fix the issue \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-17T04:48:06Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T21:30:55Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T21:30:55Z","merged_at":"2021-02-22T21:30:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"19584c70e546ea71a8ced9174cb72a660fbad47a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR moves the GPU softmax implementation (not yet the masked softmax implementation) to use RTC and adds multiple optimizations to it to improve performance.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Moved both stride1 and non-stride1 versions of the softmax kernels to use RTC\r\n- [x] The performance of the non-stride1 version was improved by running multiple rows per block and coalescing memory accesses. Benchmarks show ~4x improvement in time for the typical case, and much more (up to ~40x) when the size of the row over which the summation happens is very small.\r\n- [x] The performance of the stride1 kernel was improved by downloading multiple rows to shared memory collectively by the entire block and increasing amount of work per thread (including ability for the entire row to be summed by even a single thread, down from the minimum of 1 full warp per block in the previous version).\r\n- [x] The vectorization requirements of the previous implementation were eliminated, resulting in especially big speedup for cases where row length is odd.\r\n- [x] The stride1 kernel can now be used when the type of the output does not match the type of input (e.g. float16 input, float32 output)\r\n- [x] Overall, the performance of the stride1 kernel got improved ranging form 1.1x for BERT-like shapes (12 * 32, 128, 128), ~2x for the typical sizes with even row length and ~4x for the typical sizes with odd row length, to >20x for sizes with very small row length.\r\n- [x] Performance improvements quoted in the previous points are for the forward pass, but backward has similar (albeit slightly smaller) performance improvements.  \r\n- [x] Improved the mixed_type utility for RTC kernels (now one can use `type_util::mixed_type<DType, DType2>` instead of the previous verbose `typename type_util::mixed_type<DType, DType2>::type`, and arbitrary number of types can be passed as template arguments)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-16T23:57:24Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T16:16:10Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T16:16:10Z","merged_at":"2021-04-26T16:16:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6927704d8ceb4597f33a45037277d462ee67045","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nForward port #19895 from v1.x to master. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes a number of changes to make it more stable:\r\n\r\n* Remove SafeDocker client which uses python docker package to run containers. Change to use \"docker run\" command directly using subprocess.call(), because the python-docker client does not support a gpus parameter which newer docker versions use and we don't get timeout issues when using the docker command directly. This will allow us to update our AMIs to use newer docker versions.\r\n* In order to support both docker variants simultaneously, we first try to use the --gpus all parameter to docker run, if it fails with error code 125 (which means docker run command itself failed,) then we retry using the old --runtime nvidia parameter.\r\n* Remove the extra custom codecov calls (which usually fail and have to retry multiple times, even though the initial codecov command works.)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-16T17:47:48Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T21:07:07Z","closed_at":"2021-02-19T21:07:07Z","merged_at":"2021-02-19T21:07:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c4f5aad26b4d7aefafaf6263ccf4aa11096d2fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR makes a number of changes to make it more stable:\r\n\r\n* Remove SafeDocker client which uses python docker package to run containers. Change to use \"docker run\" command directly using subprocess.call(), because the python-docker client does not support a `gpus` parameter which newer docker versions use and we don't get timeout issues when using the docker command directly. This will allow us to update our AMIs to use newer docker versions.\r\n* In order to support both docker variants simultaneously, we first try to use the `--gpus all` parameter to `docker run`, if it

we frequently improve our ONNX support, users might want to get timely access to the latest changes. However, MXNet releases might not happen as  frequent as the users would want and they might have other compatibility concerns to update the entire mxnet module. To help with this, this pr adds a simple tool to update(replace) and restore the `mxnet/contrib/onnx` folder to the latest version on github. For example, a user that has mxnet 1.7 installed can use this script to get the latest onnx support without updating mxnet to a later version. This script helps make our onnx support more accessible and users can report bugs back and expect them fixed more easily.\r\n\r\nThe script will automatically find the currently installed mxnet. The original files will be backuped to `mxnet/contrib/onnx/backup`. `--branch` option controls which mxnet branch to checkout and if `--restore` option is specified then files in `backup` will be restored.\r\n\r\nTo update to changes in v1.x\r\n```\r\npython update_onnx.py\r\n```\r\nTo update to changes in a specific branch\r\n```\r\npython update_onnx.py --branch <branch>\r\n```\r\nTo restore the original files\r\n```\r\npython update_onnx.py

There are just too many models to test for the normal CI pipeline that gets triggered for each PR. This tests one (or a few) models of each category. We can still manually run the tests and nightly pipeline will also run them.\r\n\r\nAdded onnx end-to-end tests for all currently supported models.\r\n\r\nAlso replace deprecated ConstantFill operator

Description ##\r\nFix #19825\r\nPreviously both `mx.np.linspace`  and `numpy.linspace` round towards infinity for negative int values. `numpy.lincpace` recently fixed this to round towards -infinity

etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nReturn early if zero-sized dimension is used. Added test to `test_operator.py`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nOne caveat - for the solution to work NumPy shape semantics must be used as shown in the test, otherwise the shape's zero-sized dimension of the output gets converted to 'unknown' dimension in the call to `[src.common.utils.h]::ConvertToNumpyShape` which in turn will throw an error about unknown shape. I think it's alright to use NumPy shape semantics because the input is using NumPy semantics but if not then this will require a much bigger fix.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-03T22:17:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-07T21:51:10Z","closed_at":"2021-02-07T21:51:10Z","merged_at":"2021-02-07T21:51:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"3dd678fc5a1d861d1303c3a1182b6504807c0c8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nBased on the discussion in issue #17783, I am proposing here as base for a new Java API to use JavaCPP, which takes care of building MXNet from source, generating appropriate low-level wrapper classes and JNI code for the C API, as well as bundle the resulting binaries in artifacts. This build was adapted, ported, and upgraded to Gradle from the JavaCPP Presets for MXNet 1.x available here:\r\n * https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/mxnet\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a new \"java\" workflow for GitHub Actions that builds and deploys binaries for Linux (CentOS 7), Mac, and Windows, with and without CUDA (although the build currently fails with CUDA 11.2 on Windows), which produces files as per those previously deployed here:\r\n * https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/bytedeco/mxnet/2.0-SNAPSHOT/\r\n\r\n(To have this deploy artifacts as part of `org.apache`, we need to enter credentials under the CI_DEPLOY_USERNAME and CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD secrets for GitHub Actions.)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Configurations to build and map the C API to Java with Gradle and JavaCPP\r\n- [x] An initial simple test that runs as part of the CI on GitHub Actions under the \"java\" workflow\r\n- [x] API documentation that gets deployed automatically from Javadoc\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The generated wrapper classes are not currently being pushed as source to the repository. Should they be? We can see what that looks like here: https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/mxnet/src/gen/java/org/bytedeco/mxnet\r\n- I believe the code is generally straightforward to follow, so I have not added a lot of comments, but please let me know which parts may need to be better documented, if any.\r\n- There probably should be some small example somewhere that developers of the high-level API could use as starting point. But where should we put that? What should it contain? I'm thinking something like this:

Description ##\r\nCurrently ONNX export does not support multiple input data types. It masks the first input's data type to all other input nodes. This PR enables multiple input data types, which benefits operators like `where` and `dequantize`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g.

this pr we would manually expand MXNet softmax. This was due to the mismatch between the configuration of mxnet and onnx softmax. \r\n\r\nHowever we can adapt the onnx softmax to behave the same as mxnet softmax for the axis==-1 case. This is exactly how Gluon BERT uses softmax. With this optimization we 1) improve the runtime 2) avoid NaN issue caused by Exp when running inference with TensorRT in fp16
