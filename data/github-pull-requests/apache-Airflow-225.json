this one parses schema field from parts AFTER the / , while the connection schema is returned within conn_type field.

could never get it to accurately use the https that I had set in the connection URI.\r\nThis may only happen using secrets backend, since the connections set in airflow UI have their fields mapped directly.\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen: https://host.com should yield connection schema to be https\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce it:\r\nPull airflow from master, create a sample DAG using http hook, with connection being set to https, with the connection string pulled from some secrets manager (in my case I used AWS secrets manager)\r\n\r\nAnything else we need to know:\r\nThis issue seems to be

of running separate pylint checks for tests and main source\r\nwe are running a single check now.

tokenization)\r\n\r\nThanks to that we can also separate out pylint checks\r\nto a separate job in CI - this way all pylint checks will\r\nbe run in parallel to all other checks effectively

PR introduces `TaskGroup`, which is a simple UI task grouping concept. \r\n\r\nWhat this PR does:\r\n- TaskGroups can be collapsed/expanded in Graph View when clicked\r\n- TaskGroups can be nested\r\n- TaskGroups can be put upstream/downstream of tasks or other TaskGroups with `>>` and `<<` operators\r\n- Search box, hovering, focusing in Graph View treats TaskGroup properly. E.g. searching for tasks also highlights TaskGroup that contains matching task_id. When TaskGroup is expanded/collapsed, the affected TaskGroup is put in focus and moved to the centre of the graph.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does not do:\r\n- This PR does not change or remove `SubDagOperator`. Although `TaskGroup` is intended as an alternative for `SubDagOperator`, deprecating `SubDagOperator` will need to be discussed/implemented in the future.\r\n- This PR only implemented `TaskGroup` handling in the Graph View. In places such as Tree View, it will look like as-if `TaskGroup` does not exist and all tasks are in the same flat DAG.\r\n\r\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8078\r\nAIP: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-34+TaskGroup%3A+A+UI+task+grouping+concept+as+an+alternative+to+SubDagOperator\r\n\r\nThis is the example_task_group that this PR

I actually created https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10147 and then started adding the type annotations. Then the `mypy` check helped uncover the bug, too!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nairflow/providers/sqlite/hooks/sqlite.py:37: error: \"SqliteHook\" has no attribute \"sqlite_conn_id\"\r\n            conn = self.get_connection(self.sqlite_conn_id)  # pylint: disable=no-member\r\n                                       ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n`mypy` also got confused by having two different variables called `conn`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nairflow/providers/sqlite/hooks/sqlite.py:38: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type\r\n\"sqlite3.dbapi2.Connection\", variable has type \"airflow.models.connection.Connection\")\r\n            conn = sqlite3.connect(conn.host)\r\n                   ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the airflow `Connection` object to `airflow_conn` helped clear that up.\r\n\r\ncloses: #10147\r\nrelated: #9708\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Also reusing the existing hook and operator modules (`cloud_memorystore.py`)\r\n1. created a new how to guide because it didn't feel as natural to put in the Memcached specific operators in the existing one, does that make sense?\r\n1. does it make sense to have a single `UpdateAndApply` operator that combines 2 REST API methods [specified here](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/memcached/reference/rest/v1beta2/projects.locations.instances#methods) - is that better as opposed to having them be independent operators? I would still have them be standalone methods in the Hook, the operator is what would call them one after another.\r\n\r\n## What is next?\r\nAfter the initial review and clarification on approach, will: \r\n- continue to make the other operators reflecting [REST API methods](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/memcached/reference/rest/v1beta2/projects.locations.instances#methods), including Memcache specific ones like IAM and update and apply parameters.\r\n  - this includes more tests\r\n- add examples to the DAG and corresponding entries in the How to guide\r\n- run all operators locally and test with personal GCP account that they all work as intended\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
