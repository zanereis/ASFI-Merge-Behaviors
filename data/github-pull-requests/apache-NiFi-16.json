Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12524](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12524) Corrects handling of null property values in Flow Change Connect Details auditing objects.\r\n\r\nThe original H2 database schema in NiFi 1.23 and required almost all columns to be populated, with the exception of the following fields in Connect Details:\r\n\r\n- Source Name\r\n- Destination Name\r\n- Relationship\r\n\r\nChanges include checking for null before attempting to set these properties on the Entity object, and unit tests to exercise both populated and null behavior.\r\n\r\nThis corrects issues when migrating some existing Flow Configuration History from NiFi 1.23 and earlier. This pull request is targeted to the main branch, but is also ready for backporting to the support branch.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11703) Upgrades framework and extension components to Spring Framework 6 and Jetty 12.\r\n\r\nSpring Framework 6 and Jetty 12 incorporate new baseline versions of Jakarta EE API components, including Jakarta Servlet API 6.0, Jakarta RESTful Web Services API 3.0, and Jakarta XML Binding 4.0.\r\n\r\nThe interconnected nature of these libraries required widespread changes to many REST Resource classes and model objects. The vast majority of changes are limited to package name changes from `javax` to `jakarta` as required for the latest versions of Jakarta EE API libraries.\r\n\r\nMore substantive changes involve the upgrade from Jetty 10 to 12, which includes new Jetty modules and package names supporting Jakarta EE 10. Some of these changes include removing complicated or duplicative test classes that depended on older version of Jetty.\r\n\r\nOther notable changes include replacing legacy Swagger Maven Plugins with current versions based on OpenAPI Version 3, also required as part of Jakarta EE API upgrades.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that full migration to OpenAPI annotations requires an additional upgrade to newer Swagger Annotations 2. This should be targeted for a subsequent pull request, as it requires adjustments to all current REST Resource classes and methods. The current plugin configuration produces HTML documentation based on Swagger definitions, but response object details are not provided as a result of the current annotations. This will be corrected when upgrading to Swagger Annotations 2 and adjusting references.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that initial evaluation of Spring Framework 6.1 resulted in problems with parameter resolution in AspectJ-based Auditor classes. This is not an issue in Spring Framework 6.0, but further evaluation is necessary for upgrading NiFi itself to Spring Framework 6.1.\r\n\r\nDependencies upgraded include the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Spring Framework from 5.3.31 to 6.0.15\r\n- Upgraded Spring Security from 5.8.7 to 6.2.0\r\n- Upgraded Spring Vault from 2.3.4 to 3.1.0\r\n- Upgraded Jetty from 10.0.18 to 12.0.5 with EE 10\r\n- Upgraded Jersey from 2.41 to 3.1.4\r\n- Upgraded JAXB from 2.3.9 to 4.0.4\r\n- Upgraded AspectJ from 1.9.20.1 to 1.9.21\r\n- Upgraded JMS API from 2.0.1 to 3.1.0\r\n- Upgraded ActiveMQ Broker from 5.18.2 to 6.0.1 for JMS 3\r\n- Upgraded JJWT from 0.9.1 to 0.12.3\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy removals and replacements include the following:\r\n\r\n- Replaced jackson-module-jaxb-annotations with jackson-module-jakarta-xmlbind-annotations\r\n- Replaced maven-jaxb2-plugin with hisrc-higherjaxb40-maven-plugin 2.1.1\r\n- Replaced kongchen swagger-maven-plugin with swagger-codegen-maven-plugin from Swagger 3\r\n- Replaced com.nickwongdev AspectJ Plugin with Codehaus 1.14.0 for newer Java versions\r\n- Removed unused cglib-nodep\r\n- Removed references to javax.validation\r\n- Removed custom Jetty ALPN Processor not required for Java 21\r\n- Removed several tests depending on older Jetty and Jakarta libraries\r\n- Removed unnecessary webdefault.xml configurations\r\n- Replaced unsupported cross-context servlet forwarding with HTTP forwarding\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

The value provided is always from `ProcessContext::getMaxConcurrentTasks`. \r\nHowever, its use was removed as part of NIFI-8021. I removed this unused parameter as well.\r\n\r\nAll tests were still passing after the removal.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

when synching to a VersionedFlow, make sure processor references to new controller services are valid after the processor migrates the configuration of its properties.\r\n\r\nThis change is to update controller service references in the CreatedExtension properties. This is important when calling migrateConfiguration on the component, because that uses the CreatedExtension properties as its \"original\" properties to migrate.\r\n\r\n- made sure CreatedExtension was created before the component is updated\r\n- made controller service reference value \"final\" so I can use it inside lambda function\r\n- fixed an unrelated but minor log INFO message problem\r\n- added unit test for synchronizing a new process group with an external flow definition\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12511](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12511) Corrects the `lib` directory configuration in the `nifi-assembly` module, providing a shared `core.xml` descriptor that includes only the required JAR files. Changes include introducing a new entry in the `common.xml` for NAR bundles and removing the duplicative `lib` definitions. This approach corrects settings that were not included in the `ranger.xml` and also eliminates unnecessary JAR files included in the standard build.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

is a refined PR for NIFI-12236 after feedback and discussion on [PR 8123](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8123). The general approach and purpose remained the same: the PR aims to refine error handling of the original impelmentation and in order to reach this, the QuestDb handling was refactored:\r\n- All QuestDB related code has been moved to a separate NAR\r\n- QuestDB usage is moved beding a Client interface, with some changes of the original usage\r\nMost of the guidelines from the original PR are still relevant, but here are some key things have changed:\r\n- NiFi API changes have been reverted\r\n- Now the Volatile  implementation is the default again\r\n- Following the changes from NIFI-12492 all QuestDB related code is not within the QuestDB bundle. Note: it has been moved out from under the framework and is part of the nifi-nar-bundles module, as other \"includable\" NARs.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking your time with the PR!\r\n\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12492](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12492) Moves the QuestDB implementation of the Status History Repository from `nifi-framework-core` to a new `nifi-framework-questdb-nar` bundle for improved maintainability. This also provides a clear separation for the 8 MB QuestDB library from the standard framework NAR.\r\n\r\nThe changes introduce a new `nifi-framework-status-history-shared` module, which is limited to API dependencies that can be shared between the standard volatile implementation and the QuestDB implementation.\r\n\r\nThe change introduces a new `include-questdb` build profile for the `nifi-framework-questdb-nar` and also upgrades QuestDB from 7.2 to 7.3.7, addressing [NIFI-12435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12435).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12475](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12475) Updates the default setting for the `Bypass Validation` property in `PutMongoRecord` to `False`.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the expanded property description and the referenced Jira issue, bypassing document validation requires additional permissions beyond basic insert and update privileges. This property should be set to `False` by default to align with the same behavior in `PutMongo`, and also to highlight the elevated permissions required as described in [MongoDB Privilege Actions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/privilege-actions/#mongodb-authaction-bypassDocumentValidation) documentation.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12487) Adds Cross-Site Request Forgery protection to NiFi Registry using the Spring Security CSRF Filter and several components that follow the same approach currently implemented for NiFi CSRF protection.\r\n\r\nNiFi Registry does not use cookies for passing Application Bearer Tokens, and instead relies on the HTTP Authorization header to be populated using a custom JavaScript request interceptor. This approach mitigates a number of potential threats. Introducing the CSRF Filter provides an additional layer of protection. Following a strategy similar to NiFi, the CSRF Request Matcher is based on the default Spring Security HTTP Method matching plus the presence of the Request Token cookie. This enables programmatic clients to continue working without reconfiguration, while requiring browser-based clients to pass the `Request-Token` header, as implemented through updates to the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12483) Streamlines JMX Metrics filtering parameter handling to run simpler string comparison when the request bean name filter parameter is provided. Application properties contain a default filter pattern that continues to apply before any request filter parameters, which is the optimal approach for providing a scoped set of JMX Metrics. The streamlined parameter parsing supports most existing use cases and also includes additional tests for a pattern with trailing wildcards.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12478](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12478) Updates supporting utilities for the `ConsumeJMS` Processor to return the Message Type as the body when receiving JMS [ObjectMessage](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/ObjectMessage.html) types. This approach avoids various problems with attempting to serialize a wrapped opaque `Object` from a JMS `ObjectMessage`. Java Object serialization is not suitable for inter-operation with subsequent Processors, and the wrapped Object may reference classes that are not available on a given Java Virtual Machine. Rather than writing the message as an error, this approach allows NiFi flows to continue receiving `ObjectMessage` types and handling the associated metadata, while using a standard value of `ObjectMessage` as the bytes for the message body.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include correcting expected values in a JMS integration test that previously resulted in failures.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12418](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12418) Corrects OpenID Connect Bearer Token refresh processing, preserving Identity Provider Group information after a token refresh occurs.\r\n\r\nFollowing refactoring in NiFi 1.24.0 to pass Identity Provider Group membership in the `groups` claim of Application Bearer Tokens, the group membership is lost when an automatic Bearer Token refresh occurs. This applies only to OpenID Connect integration, and only impacts users with Identity Provider Group membership that is not supplied through a User Group Provider.\r\n\r\nThe correction streamlines the `LoginAuthenticationToken` class, removing unnecessary constructors to avoid ambiguity. It also introduces an Issuer Provider to return a standard application Bearer Token Issuer based on the configured host and port properties. Further changes to `LoginAuthenticationToken` include changing parameters to use `java.time.Instant` for greater clarity of the expiration time, as opposed to the primitive `long` number of seconds before expiration.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

To alleviate the high task count, I removed `@TriggerWhenEmpty` since the Kerberos login/ticket renewal has been handled properly in the following `getUserGroupInformation()` call in `onTrigger`\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a reworking of the original `QuestDB` based status history based on community feedback. The main intention is to improve the maturity of the feature in order to be a possible default setting for 2.0. This improvement mainly focuses on but not limited to:\r\n- Centralisation and separation of the `QuestDB` related code in order to easier maintenance\r\n- Add capabilities to the client and database management which helps us dealing with issues (prioritising the continuity of the `NiFi` core functionality over the availability of the database)\r\n- Clarifications on the related repository code including exposing more customisation options in the properties among other things.\r\n\r\nThe review is fairly big and complicated. My suggested order for easier understanding is the following:\r\n- The retry capability is something might be tackled separately, it provides a robust solution to retry smaller operations and used by the `quest-db` module. The `SynchronousRetryTemplateTest` is suggested for quicker grasping.\r\n- The newly added `quest-db` module is a good starting point for the actual `QuestDB` functionality. The included package description provides some overview of the main areas. The unit tests most helpful for understanding are the `CompositeClientTest` and the `EmbeddedDatabaseManagerTest`. Up to these point the code are considered standalone and however it follows `NiFi` conventions in the most regards, not depending on `NiFi` features.\r\n- Last part of the PR is the changes around the application of the code above. The tests were covering the previous implementation (`EmbeddedQuestDbStatusHistoryRepositoryForComponentsTest` and `EmbeddedQuestDbStatusHistoryRepositoryForNodeTest`) are still in place and other than some smaller technical changes they still guard the function the same way. Other then these, the code organisation changed heavily. Most of the business logic around handling the snapshots are the same but as the `QuestDB` specific code are moved out from the core, the structure evolved. I suggest to start with the `EmbeddedQuestDbStatusHistoryRepository` itself and go top-down. Majority of the related code is within the same package, other changes around are to integrate it properly.\r\n\r\nPlease if any question is raising about either the approach or the implementation, do not hesitate to leave a comment about that, some additional context might be helpful to communicate my intent with the details of the change.
