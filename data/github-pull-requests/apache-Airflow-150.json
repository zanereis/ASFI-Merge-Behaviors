if I do not pass the `selected_fields` parameter in  BigQueryGetDataOperator which is equivalent to `select * from table` and bigquery table has a column having type Date, Time, Datetime or Decimal then the Python JSON module fails to serialise the response of this operator and the task fails.\r\n\r\nThis happens because when we do not pass the column name in the google client request then it returns a column value in form of an object Python JSON fails to serialise it but if I'm passing the column name then it is returned as a string \r\n\r\nThere is existing work around it by setting `enable_xcom_pickling`  to true in default_airflow.cfg but this is insecure\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Send all columns as selected_fields in case the selected_fields param is None\r\n\r\nAfter this change

parameter delegate_to parameter in the ComputeEngineSSHHook seems not working at all.\r\nSo we dug into the code and added impersonation_chain parameter which is fully supported by the other file compute.py. So we barely added a few lines in compute_ssh.py to make it work.\r\nThis allows to properly impersonate service account using ComputeEngineSSHHook. An example with iap_tunnel :\r\n```python\r\n    task1 = SSHOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"task1_id\",\r\n        ssh_hook=ComputeEngineSSHHook(\r\n            gcp_conn_id='test_connection_gcp',\r\n            instance_name=\"instance_target\",\r\n            zone=\"instance_zone\",\r\n            user=\"airflow\",\r\n            project_id=\"instance_project\",\r\n            use_oslogin=False,\r\n            use_iap_tunnel=True,\r\n            use_internal_ip=False,\r\n            impersonation_chain=\"service_account_to_impersonate\",\r\n            expire_time=\"3m\"\r\n    ),\r\n        command=\"ls -la\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nOnly tested with IAP tunnel and only one service account email in impersonation_chain.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11370\r\n\r\nHere is the first draft to add support for `date` `datetime` and `time` to `MSSQLToGCSOperator.convert_type`.\r\nI added some tests to this function.\r\n\r\nThis way we can export a schema that has date, datetime and time columns.\r\n\r\nDate and Time are for now uploaded as STRING field to big query, which is not great. Both of them have `2` returned for type oid, which makes it not trivial to map to the correct big query type.\r\n\r\n![schema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/162589255-9cb105be-227d-4fcd-889d-53ab345d6125.png)\r\n![data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/162589258-378a2607-c13a-4ac6-b035-6e3ef4c930b8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-09T19:43:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T08:40:02Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T06:36:46Z","merged_at":"2022-04-11T06:36:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"03e1c9b1521fea46ad3c7e15690810e4548f52c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

the last few months together with Outreachy interns\r\nwe rewrote the most important functionality of the old Bash-based\r\nBreeze with Python Based implementation.\r\n\r\nWe approached it in systematic way with capturing all our decisions\r\nin the ADR format (dev/breeze/docs) and implementing the parts\r\nthat are used on a daily basis by the users. Breeze2 as it was\r\ncalled is ready for Prime-Time with the users so we are swapping\r\nout the old breeze wiht the new one.\r\n\r\nThe old `breeze` has been moved to `breeze-legacy` and we will\r\ngradually parts of it that are already migrated to Python and proven\r\nwhile continue rewriting the parts that are missing (mostly the\r\nmaintainer tools) and replacing the remaining CI shell scripts with\r\nthe new `breeze` commands.\r\n\r\nWe also need to make sure that there is no accidental top-level\r\nimport for extra packages added in the future, because people\r\nwho installed breeze before will not have it - so we have\r\na pre-commit that checks if breeze.py can be parsed and\r\n--help executed with just rich and click installed.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* moves `breeze` to `breeze-legacy`\r\n* moves `Breeze2` to `breeze`\r\n* updates documentation and screenshots where applicable\r\n* explains old vs. new breeze in documentation\r\n* adds protection so that no accidental top-level import is\r\n  added to breeze.py and files imported from there\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

an issue that can occur when reattaching to ECS tasks.\r\n\r\ncloses: #22878\r\n\r\nThe code for fetching AWS logs, looks for the ecs_task_id field. When executing the task for the first time, this is updated after fetching the ARN for the first time. However, when the task is reattached to an existing ECS task, the current code will update the ARN, but will not update the ecs_task_id. The code change will ensure that the ecs_task_id is updated when the ARN is updated at the time of reattaching.","created_at":"2022-04-09T17:29:51Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T16:17:09Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T16:15:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8e9570e15724ed2e132357bac7c4e5eef835f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

the UI of the DAG and Task Instance details panel in Grid view.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- We already show DAG description at the top of the page so it isn't necessary to show in the side panel, and we don't need an entire API request just for tags, you can find that in the actual DAG Details page.\r\n- Put DAG and DAG Runs details into the same table so both columns stay aligned\r\n- Include \"Overall\" for mapped task instances and groups to emphasize that they are summaries\r\n- Show startDate and endDate in context with duration\r\n- Remove repeat code usage of `numMap` to show a breakdown of task states\r\n- Include the state color in the details panel\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1177\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-08 at 2 35 24 PM\"

the ORM to create all the Role, Permission, Action and Resource objects, only to throw them all away _on every request_ is slow. And since we are now using the API more and more in the UI it's starting to get noticeable\n\nThis changes the `user.perm` property to issue a custom query that returns the tuple of action_name, permission_name we want, bypassing the ORM object inflation entirely, and since `user.roles` isn't needed in most requests we no longer eagerly load that.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

#22833.\r\n\r\nThis needs two changes. First, when the upstream pushes the return value to XCom, we need to identify that the pushed value is not used on its own, but only aggregated with other return values from other mapped task instances. Fortunately, this is actually the only possible case right now, since we have not implemented support for depending on individual return values from a mapped task (aka nested mapping). So we instead skip recording any TaskMap metadata from a mapped task to avoid the problem altogether.\r\n\r\nThe second change is for when the downstream task is expanded. Since the task depends on the mapped upstream as a whole, we should not use TaskMap from the upstream (which corresponds to individual task instances, as mentioned above), but the XComs pushed by every instance of the mapped task. Again, since we don't nested mapping now, we can cut corners and simply check whether the upstream is mapped or not to decide what to do, and leave further logic to the future.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-08T04:38:14Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T16:40:13Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T09:29:33Z","merged_at":"2022-04-11T09:29:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"8af77127f1aa332c6e976c14c8b98b28c8a4cd26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

Instead, the webserver can send the data already as camelCased json and avoid these extra steps.\r\n\r\nWhy not just use pascal_case in the UI? javascript is usually more camelCase friendly and our linting is already configured for that.
