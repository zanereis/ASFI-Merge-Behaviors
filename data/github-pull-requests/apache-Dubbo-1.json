OSGi declarations in the Gson jar now specify that <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code>  is an optional dependency, not a required one. If you do not use OSGi then there is no effective change.</p>\n<h2>Gson 2.12.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<p>The biggest change is that we no longer support Java 7. People who still need to run on Java 7 will need to use an earlier version of Gson.</p>\n<p>Other changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow registering adapters for <code>JsonElement</code> again by <a

[com.alibaba.nacos:nacos-client](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos) from 2.4.3 to 2.5.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases\">com.alibaba.nacos:nacos-client's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.5.0 (Jan 21th, 2025)</h2>\n<p>This version mainly introduces the configuration gray history record feature and refactors and optimizes the configuration gray management to enable users to manage configuration releases and gray configurations more efficiently. It is important to note that this update may lead to certain changes in the database table structure used by Nacos, and the first startup after the upgrade may take some time for automatic data migration (this situation only applies to clusters that have used the beta gray feature in older versions).</p>\n<p>In addition to the above features, this version also includes significant optimizations and bug fixes for several other functions, including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unified client addressing logic and provision of custom extension interfaces.</li>\n<li>The client will automatically refresh the token when encountering a no-permission status during requests, without waiting for the token to expire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please see the

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.70.0</h2>\n<h2><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-enable animalsniffer, fixing most violations (8ea362937). Violations would only have triggered on API level 23 and earlier, and the violations fixed here were highly unlikely to be triggered</li>\n<li>api: Fix Android API level 23 and earlier compatibility for StatusRuntimeException without stacktrace (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11072\">#11072</a>) (ebe2b4867). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.64.0. The regression should have caused failures on API level 23 and earlier when a StatusRuntimeException or StatusException was created. However, for unknown reasons tests on old devices didn’t notice issues</li>\n<li>okhttp: Improve certificate handling by rejecting non-ASCII subject alternative names and hostnames as seen in CVE-2021-0341 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11749\">#11749</a>) (a0982ca0a). Hostnames are considered trusted and CAs are required to use punycode for non-ASCII hostnames, so this is expected to provide defense-in-depth. See also the <a href=\"https://gosecure.ai/blog/2020/10/27/weakness-in-java-tls-host-verification/\">related GoSecure blog post</a> and the <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/okhttp/+/ddc934efe3ed06ce34f3724d41cfbdcd7e7358fc\">AOSP fix</a></li>\n<li>okhttp: Fix for ipv6 link local with scope (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11725\">#11725</a>) (65b32e60e)</li>\n<li>xds: Preserve nonce when unsubscribing last watcher of a particular type so that new discovery requests of that type are handled correctly (1cf1927d1). This (along with 6c12c2bd2) fixes a nonce-handling regression introduced in 1.66.0 that could cause resources to appear to not exist until re-creating the ADS stream. Triggering the behavior required specific config changes. It is easiest to trigger when clusters use EDS and routes are changed from one cluster to another. The error “found 0 leaf (logical DNS or EDS) clusters for root cluster” might then be seen</li>\n<li>xds: Remember nonces for unknown types (6c12c2bd2)</li>\n<li>xds: Unexpected types in the bootstrap’s server_features should be ignored (e8ff6da2c). They were previously required to be strings</li>\n<li>xds: Remove xds authority label from metric registration (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11760\">#11760</a>) (6516c7387). This fixes the error “Incorrect number of required labels provided. Expected: 4” introduced in 1.69.0</li>\n<li>xds: Fixed unsupported unsigned 32 bits issue for circuit breaker (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11735\">#11735</a>) (f8f613984). This fixes clients treating large max_requests as “no requests” and failing all requests</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Improvements</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Introduce custom NameResolver.Args (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11669\">#11669</a>) (0b2d44098)</li>\n<li>stub: Introduce new API:  BlockingStubV2 which supports Bidi streaming, Client streaming, a cleaner Server streaming and Unary RPCs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10318\">#10318</a>) (ea8c31c30)</li>\n<li>bazel: Remove workaround for DoNotCall fixed in Bazel 3.4 (805cad378)</li>\n<li>binder: A standard API for pointing resolvers at a different Android User. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11775\">#11775</a>) (1126a8e30)</li>\n<li>xds: Fix XDS control plane client retry timer backoff duration when connection closes after results are received (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11766\">#11766</a>) (ef7c2d59c)</li>\n<li>xds: Parsing xDS Cluster Metadata (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11741\">#11741</a>) (1edc4d84d). Not used actively, but this adds validation. The validation is unlikely to fail but may reject invalid resources.</li>\n<li>xds: Use &quot;#server&quot; as dataplane target value for xDS enabled gRPC servers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11715\">#11715</a>) (ebb43a69e). This only impacts the <code>grpc.target</code> label in <code>grpc.xds_client.*</code> metrics. Previously the empty string was used</li>\n<li>rls: Reduce RLS debug channel logging (7f9c1f39f).

What is the purpose of the change?\r\n\r\n由于ab压测工具默认是短连接，当使用该工具压测时，针对短连接请求，没有将对应的channel设置该ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE listener时，将使ab压测工具进程hang住，故增加自动识别请求是否需要保持长连接来解决该问题。\r\n\r\nSince the ab benchmarking tool uses short connections by default, when using this tool for benchmarking, if the corresponding channel is not set with the ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE listener for short connection requests, it will cause the ab benchmarking tool process to hang. Therefore, adding automatic recognition of whether the request needs to keep the connection alive can solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.

What is the purpose of the change?\r\nThe primary role of **protocolRevisionsToUrls** in the overall code logic is to act as an intermediate cache, mapping **(protocol, port, revisions)** to **urls**. However, the ultimate goal is to construct **newServiceUrls**, and **protocolRevisionsToUrls** is not directly used elsewhere. This layer can be completely removed, and the results can be directly stored in **newServiceUrls**.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.
