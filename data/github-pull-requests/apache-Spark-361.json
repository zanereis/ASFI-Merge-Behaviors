What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis fix allows submit of pyspark jobs to specify python 2 or 3.\n\nChange ordering in setup for application master environment so env vars PYSPARK_PYTHON and PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON can be overridden by spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.\\* conf settings. This applies to YARN in cluster mode. This allows them to be set per submission without needing the unset the env vars (which is not always possible - e.g. batch submit with LIVY only exposes the arguments to spark-submit)\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLibSVMFileFormat implements data source for LIBSVM format. However, users do not really need to call its APIs to use it. So we should hide it in the public API docs. The main issue is that we still need to put the documentation and example code somewhere. The proposal it to have a dummy class to hold the documentation, as a workaround to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8124.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually checked the generated API doc and tested loading LIBSVM

note this is a revision of PR #13686, which has been closed in favor of this PR.)\n\nThis PR addresses [SPARK-15968](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15968).\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `getCached` method of [HiveMetastoreCatalog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala) computes `pathsInMetastore` from the metastore relation's catalog table. This only returns the table base path, which is incomplete/inaccurate for a nonempty partitioned table. As a result, cached lookups on nonempty partitioned tables always miss.\n\nRather than get `pathsInMetastore` from\n\n```\nmetastoreRelation.catalogTable.storage.locationUri.toSeq\n```\n\nI modified the `getCached` method to take a `pathsInMetastore` argument. Calls to this method pass in the paths computed from calls to the Hive metastore. This is how `getCached` was implemented in Spark 1.5:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e0c3212a9b42e3e704b070da4ac25b68c584427f/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala#L444.\n\nI also added a call in `InsertIntoHiveTable.scala` to invalidate the table from the SQL session catalog.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've added a new unit test to `parquetSuites.scala`:\n\n```\nSPARK-15968: nonempty partitioned metastore Parquet table lookup should use cached relation\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between this new test and the one above it in the file is that the new test populates its partitioned table with a single value, while the existing test leaves the table empty. This reveals a subtle, unexpected hole in test coverage present before this patch.\n\nNote I also modified a different but related unit test in `parquetSuites.scala`:\n\n```\nSPARK-15248: explicitly added partitions should be readable\n```\n\nThis unit test asserts that Spark SQL should return data from a table partition which has been placed there outside a metastore query immediately after it is added. I changed the test so that, instead of adding the data as a parquet file saved in the partition's location, the data is added through a SQL `INSERT` query. I made this change because I could find no way to efficiently support partitioned table caching without failing that test.\n\nIn addition to my primary motivation, I can offer a few reasons I believe this is an acceptable weakening of that test. First, it still validates a fix for [SPARK-15248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15248), the issue for which it was written. Second, the assertion made is stronger than that required for non-partitioned tables. If you write data to the storage location of a non-partitioned metastore table without using a proper SQL DML query, a subsequent call to show that data will not return it. I believe this is an intentional limitation put in place to make table caching feasible, but I'm only speculating.\n\nBuilding a large `HadoopFsRelation` requires `stat`-ing all of its data files. In our environment, where we have tables with 10's of thousands of partitions, the difference between using a cached relation versus a new one is a matter of seconds versus minutes. Caching partitioned table metadata vastly improves the usability of Spark SQL for these cases.\n\nThanks.\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T21:16:59Z","updated_at":"2017-01-07T19:48:10Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T01:50:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a394ac2fbb32efc2609c70cbae6267ab7049d98c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91ef9508a2cb992772547bc2cc5c01c63b41abd4","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-15968","ref":"spark-15968","sha":"91ef9508a2cb992772547bc2cc5c01c63b41abd4","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a reported bug, which causes IndexOutOfBoundsException during the code generation.\nThis issue is cased for a `MapObjects` instance which has the same object for `loopVar` and `lambdaFunction`. \n\n``` scala\ncase class MapObjects private(\n    loopVar: LambdaVariable,\n    lambdaFunction: Expression,\n    inputData: Expression) extends Expression with NonSQLExpression {\n\n  override def children: Seq[Expression] = lambdaFunction :: inputData :: Nil\n```\n\nIn such case, `loopVar` is handled as a child in `TreeNode.withNewChildren` since the object is included in children as `lambdaFunction`. \nI add checks for the number of unprocessed children to avoid this issue.\nIs there any idea on cleaner way to avoid such a pathological case?\n\nI also add `assert` to confirm that the mapping `Children` and `productElement` is correct.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUsing existing unit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR migrates some test cases introduced in #12313 as a follow-up of #13754 and #13766. These test cases cover `DataFrameWriter.insertInto()`, while the former two only cover SQL `INSERT` statements.\n\nNote that the `testPartitionedTable` utility method tests both Hive SerDe tables and data source tables.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T13:26:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T23:19:09Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T18:59:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebf27324368d2a73f7cfefce874c8f7ae744636a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d8d5e4f98064b4179ffd97464f5a16d2966d583","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-16037-follow-up-tests","ref":"spark-16037-follow-up-tests","sha":"7d8d5e4f98064b4179ffd97464f5a16d2966d583","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR let `CsvWriter` object is not created for each time but able to be reused. This way was taken after from JSON data source.\n\nOriginal `CsvWriter` was being created for each row but it was enhanced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13229. However, it still creates `CsvWriter` object for each `flush()` in `LineCsvWriter`. It seems it does not have to close the object and re-create this for every flush. \n\nIt follows the original logic as it is but `CsvWriter` is reused by reseting `CharArrayWriter`. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T12:42:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:50Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T05:00:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b48019a02c3e93a4fba1c5d2790ae4adf1e9b2e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/882a24ffd1075f5913660f440ec01b3e7a3fa2ec","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:write-perf","ref":"write-perf","sha":"882a24ffd1075f5913660f440ec01b3e7a3fa2ec","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR removes meaningless `StringIteratorReader` for CSV data source.\n\nIn `CSVParser.scala`, there is an `Reader` wrapping `Iterator` but there are two problems by this.\n\nFirstly, it was actually not faster than processing line by line with Iterator due to additional logics to wrap `Iterator` to `Reader`.\nSecondly, this brought a bit of complexity because it needs additional logics to allow every line to be read bytes by bytes. So, it was pretty difficult to figure out issues about parsing, (eg. SPARK-14103).\n\nA benchmark was performed manually and the results were below:\n- Original codes with Reader wrapping Iterator\n\n| End-to-end (ns) | Parse Time (ns) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 14116265034 | 2008277960 |\n- New codes with Iterator\n\n| End-to-end (ns) | Parse Time (ns) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 13451699644 | 1549050564 |\n\nFor the details for the environment, dataset and methods, please refer the JIRA ticket.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T11:48:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:54Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T18:44:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bb79a22da8640a33d9331031fe597d37f40405a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59146894f7c8da2d70af984f6aeba14fe9c43ad7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14480-small","ref":"SPARK-14480-small","sha":"59146894f7c8da2d70af984f6aeba14fe9c43ad7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current spark cannot use `HashAggregateExec` for non-partial aggregates because `Collect` (`CollectSet`/`CollectList`) uses a single shared buffer inside. Since SortAggregateExec is expensive in some cases, we'd better off fixing this.\n\nThis pr is to change plans from\n\n```\nSortAggregate(key=[key#3077], functions=[collect_set(value#3078, 0, 0)], output=[key#3077,collect_set(value)#3088])\n+- *Sort [key#3077 ASC], false, 0\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#3077, 5)\n      +- Scan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is a subset of #13023 by @yanboliang to make SparkR model param names and default values consistent with MLlib. I tried to avoid other changes from #13023 to keep this PR minimal. I will send a follow-up PR to improve the documentation.\n\nMain changes:\n- `spark.glm`: epsilon -> tol, maxit -> maxIter\n- `spark.kmeans`: default k -> 2, default maxIter -> 20, default initMode -> \"k-means||\"\n- `spark.naiveBayes`: laplace -> smoothing, default 1.0\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T06:55:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T15:32:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T15:32:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2442179dbb6ed9955e3250cb94aeea7f3ab40e21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a712fec859ed0ea73cf592bd05220fd94d7cf70","head":{"label":"mengxr:SPARK-15177.1","ref":"SPARK-15177.1","sha":"0a712fec859ed0ea73cf592bd05220fd94d7cf70","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17278743,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI3ODc0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"mengxr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a new estimator/transformer `MultinomialLogisticRegression` to spark ML. \n\nJIRA: [SPARK-7159](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7159)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new test suite `MultinomialLogisticRegressionSuite`.\n## Approach\n### Do not use a \"pivot\" class in the algorithm formulation\n\nMany implementations of multinomial logistic regression treat the problem as K - 1 independent binary logistic regression models where K is the number of possible outcomes in the output variable. In this case, one outcome is chosen as a \"pivot\" and the other K - 1 outcomes are regressed against the pivot. This is somewhat undesirable since the coefficients returned will be different for different choices of pivot variables. An alternative approach to the problem models class conditional probabilites using the softmax function and will return uniquely identifiable coefficients (assuming regularization is applied). This second approach is used in R's glmnet and was also recommended by @dbtsai. \n### Separate multinomial logistic regression and binary logistic regression\n\nThe initial design makes multinomial logistic regression a separate estimator/transformer than the existing LogisticRegression estimator/transformer. An alternative design would be to merge them into one. \n\n**Arguments for:**\n- The multinomial case without pivot is distinctly different than the current binary case since the binary case uses a pivot class. \n- The current logistic regression model in ML uses a vector of coefficients and a scalar intercept. In the multinomial case, we require a matrix of coefficients and a vector of intercepts. There are potential workarounds for this issue if we were to merge the two estimators, but none are particularly elegant. \n\n**Arguments against:**\n- It may be inconvenient for users to have to switch the estimator class when transitioning between binary and multiclass (although the new multinomial estimator can be used for two class outcomes).\n- Some portions of the code are repeated.\n\nThis is a major design point and warrants more discussion.\n### Mean centering\n\nWhen no regularization is applied, the coefficients will not be uniquely identifiable. This is not hard to show and is discussed in further detail [here](https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6287975.pdf). R's glmnet deals with this by choosing the minimum l2 regularized solution (i.e. mean centering). Additionally, the intercepts are never regularized so they are always mean centered. This is the approach taken in this PR as well.\n### Feature scaling\n\nIn current ML logistic regression, the features are always standardized when running the optimization algorithm. They are always returned to the user in the original feature space, however. This same approach is maintained in this patch as well, but the implementation details are different. In ML logistic regression, the unregularized feature values are divided by the column standard deviation in every gradient update iteration. In contrast, MLlib transforms the entire input dataset to the scaled space _before_ optimizaton. In ML, this means that `numFeatures * numClasses` extra scalar divisions are required in every iteration. Performance testing shows that this has significant (4x in some cases) slow downs in each iteration. This can be avoided by transforming the input to the scaled space ala MLlib once, before iteration begins. This does add some overhead initially, but can make significant time savings in some cases. \n\nOne issue with this approach is that if the input data is already cached, there may not be enough memory to cache the transformed data, which would make the algorithm _much_ slower. The tradeoffs here merit more discussion. \n### Specifying and inferring the number of outcome classes\n\nThe estimator checks the dataframe label column for metadata which specifies the number of values. If they are not specified, the length of the `histogram` variable is used, which is essentially the maximum value found in the column. The assumption then, is that the labels are zero-indexed when they are provided to the algorithm. \n## Performance\n\nBelow are some performance tests I have run so far. I am happy to add more cases or trials if we deem them necessary.\n\nTest cluster: 4 bare metal nodes, 128 GB RAM each, 48 cores each\n\nNotes:\n- Time in units of seconds\n- Metric is classification accuracy\n\n| algo | elasticNetParam | fitIntercept | metric | maxIter | numPoints | numClasses | numFeatures | time | standardization | regParam |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ml | 0 | true | 0.746415 | 30 | 100000 | 3 | 100000 | 327.923 | true | 0 |\n| mllib | 0 | true | 0.743785 | 30 | 100000 | 3 | 100000 | 390.217 | true | 0 |\n\n| algo | elasticNetParam | fitIntercept | metric | maxIter | numPoints | numClasses | numFeatures | time | standardization | regParam |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ml | 0 | true | 0.973238 | 30 | 2000000 | 3 | 10000 | 385.476 | true | 0 |\n| mllib | 0 | true | 0.949828 | 30 | 2000000 | 3 | 10000 | 550.403 | true | 0 |\n\n| algo | elasticNetParam | fitIntercept | metric | maxIter | numPoints | numClasses | numFeatures | time | standardization | regParam |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| mllib | 0 | true | 0.864358 | 30 | 2000000 | 3 | 10000 | 543.359 | true | 0.1 |\n| ml | 0 | true | 0.867418 | 30 | 2000000 | 3 | 10000 | 401.955 | true | 0.1 |\n\n| algo | elasticNetParam | fitIntercept | metric | maxIter | numPoints | numClasses | numFeatures | time | standardization | regParam |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ml | 1 | true | 0.807449 | 30 | 2000000 | 3 | 10000 | 334.892 | true | 0.05 |\n\n| algo | elasticNetParam | fitIntercept | metric | maxIter | numPoints | numClasses | numFeatures | time | standardization | regParam |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ml | 0 | true | 0.602006 | 30 | 2000000 | 500 | 100 | 112.319 | true | 0 |\n| mllib | 0 | true | 0.567226 | 30 | 2000000 | 500 | 100 | 263.768 | true | 0 |\n## References\n\nFriedman, et al.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBoth VectorUDT and MatrixUDT are private APIs, because UserDefinedType itself is private in Spark.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, we use local timezone to parse or format a timestamp (TimestampType), then use Long as the microseconds since epoch UTC.\n\nIn from_utc_timestamp() and to_utc_timestamp(), we did not consider the local timezone, they could return different results with different local timezone.\n\nThis PR will do the conversion based on human time (in local timezone), it should return same result in whatever timezone. But because the mapping from absolute timestamp to human time is not exactly one-to-one mapping, it will still return wrong result in some timezone (also in the begging or ending of DST).\n\nThis PR is kind of the best effort fix. In long term, we should make the TimestampType be timezone aware to fix this totally.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested these function in all timezone.\n","created_at":"2016-06-20T20:32:58Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T20:42:10Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T20:42:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e4a9f9b2b9c837ace3d1b037bb6637c3cc7ba0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/659c9fe08e2cc86ddbd6db1c33509611208eff85","head":{"label":"davies:convert_tz","ref":"convert_tz","sha":"659c9fe08e2cc86ddbd6db1c33509611208eff85","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere are two related bugs of Python-only UDTs. Because the test case of second one needs the first fix too. I put them into one PR. If it is not appropriate, please let me know.\n### First bug: When MapObjects works on Python-only UDTs\n\n`RowEncoder` will use `PythonUserDefinedType.sqlType` for its deserializer expression. If the sql type is `ArrayType`, we will have `MapObjects` working on it. But `MapObjects` doesn't consider `PythonUserDefinedType` as its input data type. It causes error like:\n\n```\nimport pyspark.sql.group\nfrom pyspark.sql.tests import PythonOnlyPoint, PythonOnlyUDT\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\n\nschema = StructType().add(\"key\", LongType()).add(\"val\", PythonOnlyUDT())\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(i % 3, PythonOnlyPoint(float(i), float(i))) for i in range(10)], schema=schema)\ndf.show()\n\nFile \"/home/spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.1-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 312, in get_return_value py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o36.showString.\n: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error while decoding: scala.MatchError: org.apache.spark.sql.types.PythonUserDefinedType@f4ceede8 (of class org.apache.spark.sql.types.PythonUserDefinedType)\n...\n```\n### Second bug: When Python-only UDTs is the element type of ArrayType\n\n```\nimport pyspark.sql.group\nfrom pyspark.sql.tests import PythonOnlyPoint, PythonOnlyUDT\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\n\nschema = StructType().add(\"key\", LongType()).add(\"val\", ArrayType(PythonOnlyUDT()))\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(i % 3, [PythonOnlyPoint(float(i), float(i))]) for i in range(10)], schema=schema)\ndf.show()\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPySpark's sql tests.\n","created_at":"2016-06-20T06:57:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:46Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T17:10:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccec49ea494d34bb84d3b73dc8139eba63ba4794","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6065364da697cd29f9b31179063e6cf604aa25ef","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-pyudt","ref":"fix-pyudt","sha":"6065364da697cd29f9b31179063e6cf604aa25ef","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to fix the following bugs:\n\n**Issue 1: Wrong Results when lowerBound is larger than upperBound in Column Partitioning**\n\n``` scala\nspark.read.jdbc(\n  url = urlWithUserAndPass,\n  table = \"TEST.seq\",\n  columnName = \"id\",\n  lowerBound = 4,\n  upperBound = 0,\n  numPartitions = 3,\n  connectionProperties = new Properties)\n```\n\n**Before code changes:**\nThe returned results are wrong and the generated partitions are wrong:\n\n```\n  Part 0 id < 3 or id is null\n  Part 1 id >= 3 AND id < 2\n  Part 2 id >= 2\n```\n\n**After code changes:**\nIssue an `IllegalArgumentException` exception:\n\n```\nOperation not allowed: the lower bound of partitioning column is larger than the upper bound. lowerBound: 5; higherBound: 1\n```\n\n**Issue 2: numPartitions is more than the number of key values between upper and lower bounds**\n\n``` scala\nspark.read.jdbc(\n  url = urlWithUserAndPass,\n  table = \"TEST.seq\",\n  columnName = \"id\",\n  lowerBound = 1,\n  upperBound = 5,\n  numPartitions = 10,\n  connectionProperties = new Properties)\n```\n\n**Before code changes:**\nReturned correct results but the generated partitions are very inefficient, like:\n\n```\nPartition 0: id < 1 or id is null\nPartition 1: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 2: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 3: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 4: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 5: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 6: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 7: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 8: id >= 1 AND id < 1\nPartition 9: id >= 1\n```\n\n**After code changes:**\nAdjust `numPartitions` and can return the correct answers:\n\n```\nPartition 0: id < 2 or id is null\nPartition 1: id >= 2 AND id < 3\nPartition 2: id >= 3 AND id < 4\nPartition 3: id >= 4\n```\n\n**Issue 3: java.lang.ArithmeticException when numPartitions is zero**\n\n``` Scala\nspark.read.jdbc(\n  url = urlWithUserAndPass,\n  table = \"TEST.seq\",\n  columnName = \"id\",\n  lowerBound = 0,\n  upperBound = 4,\n  numPartitions = 0,\n  connectionProperties = new Properties)\n```\n\n**Before code changes:**\nGot the following exception:\n\n```\n  java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n```\n\n**After code changes:**\nAble to return a correct answer by disabling column partitioning when numPartitions is equal to or less than zero\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases to verify the results\n","created_at":"2016-06-19T17:22:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T04:50:56Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T04:50:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f102409a6095cf9e307223fdacbcd4542e8ac320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d2ae9a0ea061577402aece4c2b49458009d7029","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:jdbcPartitioning","ref":"jdbcPartitioning","sha":"7d2ae9a0ea061577402aece4c2b49458009d7029","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses a ToDo of `GenericArrayData` class. Current implementation of `GenericArrayData` leads to boxing/unboxing if type of array elements are primitive. It would be good to eliminate boxing/unboxing from the view of runtime memory footprint and performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminattes boxing/unboxing by enhancing implementation of  `GenericArrayData`. Since it does not change current API `new GenericArrayData(...)`, it minimized amount of changes.\r\nThis PR also optimize generate code of projection for an primitive type array. While we know primitive type array does not require null check and has contiguous data region, this PR performs bulk data copy by using `Platform.copy` without null checks.\r\n\r\nHere are major improvements:\r\n1. Hold an array in a primitive array (previously `Object[]` is used to hold a primitive array and boxing happened in a constructor)\r\n2. a method `get<Type>()` gets a value from an primitive array (previously unboxing happened)\r\n3. a method `to<Type>Array()` performs data copy using `System.arraycopy` (previously unboxing happened)\r\n4. a method `UnsafeArrayWrite.writePrimitive<PrimitiveType>Array()` performs data copy using `Platform.copy`.\r\n\r\nHere are performance results of micro benchmarks\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR eliminates nullcheck code at projection for an array type. The nullcheck a call to write each element of an array (lines 076-078 in \"Before applying this PR\") is generated. If we know all of the elements do not have `null` at compilation time, we can eliminate code for nullcheck.\n\nThis PR checks whether `ArrayType.containsNull` is `false` to know the all of array elements do not have `null`.\n\nAn example program\n\n```\nval df = sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(1.0, 2.0), 1).toDF(\"v\")\ndf.selectExpr(\"Array(v + 2.2, v + 3.3)\").collect\n```\n\nBefore applying

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current table insertion has some weird behaviours:\n1. inserting into a partitioned table with mismatch columns has confusing error message for hive table, and wrong result for datasource table\n2. inserting into a partitioned table without partition list has wrong result for hive table.\n\nThis PR fixes these 2 problems.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in hive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`DataFrameWriter` can be used to append data to existing data source tables. It becomes tricky when partition columns used in `DataFrameWriter.partitionBy(columns)` don't match the actual partition columns of the underlying table. This pull request enforces the check so that the partition columns of these two always match.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a text-based socket source similar to the one in Spark Streaming for debugging and tutorials. The source is clearly marked as debug-only so that users don't try to run it in production applications, because this type of source cannot provide HA without storing a lot of state in Spark.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests and manual tests in spark-shell.\n","created_at":"2016-06-18T00:59:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T04:28:45Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T04:28:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"364721edf9e0f5ae48398a10cda089a27898c8f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e61adfd81cbac57ed3c9ceae958b46f7f1943393","head":{"label":"mateiz:socket-source","ref":"socket-source","sha":"e61adfd81cbac57ed3c9ceae958b46f7f1943393","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17194569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5NDU2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"mateiz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes the problem that the precedence order is messed when pushing where-clause expression to JDBC layer. \n\n**Case 1:**\n\nFor sql `select * from table where (a or b) and c`, the where-clause is wrongly converted to JDBC where-clause `a or (b and c)` after filter push down. The consequence is that JDBC may returns less or more rows than expected.\n\n**Case 2:**\n\nFor sql `select * from table where always_false_condition`, the result table may not be empty if the JDBC RDD is partitioned using where-clause:\n\n```\nspark.read.jdbc(url, table, predicates = Array(\"partition 1 where clause\", \"partition 2 where clause\"...)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n\nThis PR also close #13640

code doesn't cause the Exception because `textFile` method loads `HdfsConfiguration` indirectly.\n\n```\nsc.textFile(\"<path on HDFS>\").collect\n```\n\nWhen a job includes some operations which

[SPARK-16008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16008)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`LogisticAggregator` stores references to two arrays of dimension `numFeatures` which are serialized before the combine op, unnecessarily. This results in the shuffle write being ~3x (for multiclass logistic regression, this number will go up) larger than it should be (in MLlib, for instance, it is 3x smaller).\n\nThis patch modifies `LogisticAggregator.add` to accept the two arrays as method parameters which avoids the serialization. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested this locally and verified the serialization reduction. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7275795/16140387/d2974bac-3404-11e6-94f9-268860c931a2.png)\n\nAdditionally, I ran some tests of a 4 node cluster (4x48 cores, 4x128 GB RAM).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nStarting Spark 2.0, vectorized decoding is introduced for improving parquet reading performance. This feature changes the filter pushdown behavior of parquet reading. Thus, this PR updates the out-of-dated description of two external `SQLConf`: `spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown` and `spark.sql.parquet.enableVectorizedReader`. \n\nThe PR also slightly simplifies the code for building `parquetReader`. cc @davies @liancheng @marmbrus \n\nBecause the current test cases do not verify the behavior when `spark.sql.parquet.filterPushdown` is set to `false`, added a test case for improving the test case coverage. Also, improved the test case when the parquet file path points to either non-existent files or non-existent hosts. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded the related test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-06-17T03:52:39Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T03:22:56Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T03:22:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1b2cbbe73e74ee80dd3afa6a9a1fe5214138b22","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:addTestForParquet","ref":"addTestForParquet","sha":"d1b2cbbe73e74ee80dd3afa6a9a1fe5214138b22","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIssues with current reader behavior.\n- `text()` without args returns an empty DF with no columns -> inconsistent, its expected that text will always return a DF with `value` string field,\n- `textFile()` without args fails with exception because of the above reason, it expected the DF returned by `text()` to have a `value` field.\n- `orc()` does not have var args, inconsistent with others\n- `json(single-arg)` was removed, but that caused source compatibility issues - [SPARK-16009](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16009)\n- user specified schema was not respected when `text/csv/...` were used with no args - [SPARK-16007](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16007)\n\nThe solution I am implementing is to do the following. \n- For each format, there will be a single argument method, and a vararg method. For json, parquet, csv, text, this means adding json(string), etc.. For orc, this means adding orc(varargs).\n- Remove the special handling of text(), csv(), etc. that returns empty dataframe with no fields. Rather pass on the empty sequence of paths to the datasource, and let each datasource handle it right. For e.g, text data source, should return empty DF with schema (value: string)\n- Deduped docs and fixed their formatting.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests for Scala and Java tests\n","created_at":"2016-06-17T03:39:25Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T23:40:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-20T21:54:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6285b5a408c284d6fdb213f7e7d299095ef11e4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2539a947d382d8d6c21c59fe8a9420a15aad9b9a","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-15982","ref":"SPARK-15982","sha":"2539a947d382d8d6c21c59fe8a9420a15aad9b9a","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror
