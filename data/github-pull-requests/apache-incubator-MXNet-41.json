free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nCurrently, during call to ReleaseAll (either in pooled allocator destructor or when the memory is full and the allocator needs to release cached allocations) the memory handle is not fully populated (only ptr and size are populated, not context information), which makes the DirectFreeNoLock method to switch to GPU 0 (since 0 is the default constructed Context's dev_id). In the case of multi process training (e.g. with Horovod) this could produce Out of Memory errors due to context creation on GPU 0, or it could outright fail, crashing the application, if the exclusive mode is set on GPU 0.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by adding `initial_context_` parameter to pooled storage managers and populating the handle with it in ReleaseAll method.\r\n\r\n@apeforest @yuxihu FYI\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-28T13:05:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-31T23:31:54Z","closed_at":"2019-03-31T23:31:34Z","merged_at":"2019-03-31T23:31:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"40752126e488cce08605682ff6b3b3c2d446177d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues related to the backend of MXNet"},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds nightly RNN Integration test using Gluon fit() API.\r\nJIRA epic can be found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1375\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1375](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1375), \r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] test_sentiment_rnn: Test the RNN model on CPU using Synthetic data and on GPU using IMDB dataset. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@roywei @nswamy @abhinavs95

Description ##\r\nHi! there.\r\nCurrently, SyncBatchNorm doesn't support 5+D input.\r\nIn this PR, I fix it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] tiny change. The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] modify the code of SyncBatchNorm to support 2+D inputs.\r\n- [x] Remove the default value `key` for SyncBatchNorm\r\n- [x] Using CUDNN to compute 5+D inputs for BatchNorm\r\n- [x] modify the testcase `test_sync_batchnorm`\r\n- [x] Add an operator-test for BatchNorm and SyncBatchNorm\r\n- [x] reformat `tests/python/gpu/test_gluon_gpu.py`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-27T12:50:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T15:59:51Z","closed_at":"2019-04-02T17:53:03Z","merged_at":"2019-04-02T17:53:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2f5b47346e148c2376da7e6628750747f2d6a94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

[MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-03-26T19:50:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T15:42:07Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T15:42:07Z","merged_at":"2019-03-29T15:42:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d04238c4a087a87e089f9c627cd64870598bcfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":863183895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Clojure","name":"Clojure","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\nFixes some clojure tests that were not being run because the `is` macro from `clojure.test` was returning true.\r\nTests were defined like so\r\n```\r\n(is (= expected) value)\r\n```\r\ninstead of like this\r\n```\r\n(is (= expected value))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T15:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T15:01:27Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T15:01:27Z","merged_at":"2019-03-29T15:01:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f5dfbf778a02855086d1ccd713cf551ca1b05c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":863183895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Clojure","name":"Clojure","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

second interval.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Using a different Jenkins plugin [GitHub Integration Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Integration+Plugin) has been considered, but unfortunately after installation there was not way to configure it - the options were missing from the configuration screen\r\n- All other plugins required explicit credentials passing as arguments \r\n- No way of asking for the commit status for verification has been found to check the status after the update\r\n- No way for checking the list of repositories that need to be updated was found (and whether it's empty) - all what happens, happens internally in the plugin\r\n\r\nAll of this made the proposed solution the only option.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T15:07:55Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T13:46:01Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T13:46:01Z","merged_at":"2019-04-09T13:46:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"733e54cd9d411b3eb0052cf5ffe210645b4c6e2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe way CI is at the moment, some failing GPU tests are going undetected. I'm putting together a PR (#14513) to update CI do CUDA v10 and fix a bug in the way the cuDNN version gets used in the tests.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I fix one such failing test introduced in PR #14219, where the function signature for `check_rnn_layer_forward` was changed and a context parameter added with a default value of mx.cpu().\r\n\r\nThe [test_lstmp](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tests/python/gpu/test_gluon_gpu.py#L86) test fails because it uses the `check_rnn_layer_forward` function without setting the context to mx.gpu(0).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I remove the default value to force the user to set the context. Thus avoiding such errors in the future.\r\n\r\nFor an example failure, see:

created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14504 to the v1.4.x branch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T09:46:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T16:18:16Z","closed_at":"2019-03-26T16:17:52Z","merged_at":"2019-03-26T16:17:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"06a5c37213a68d7d9b8561a2a55023e8f0bb9264","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/14526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d43d569037d907daa0f2f6208c84cdd6b84c9ca8","head":{"label":"lebeg:v1.4.x_fix_ci","ref":"v1.4.x_fix_ci","sha":"d43d569037d907daa0f2f6208c84cdd6b84c9ca8","user":{"login":"lebeg","id":1753787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg","html_url":"https://github.com/lebeg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109136430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkxMzY0MzA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lebeg/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lebeg","id":1753787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg","html_url":"https://github.com/lebeg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebeg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lebeg/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nPort of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14504 to the v1.3.x branch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-26T09:42:55Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T17:22:15Z","closed_at":"2019-03-26T17:22:15Z","merged_at":"2019-03-26T17:22:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e083577872acbd5227be55f85d55b28fd6009351","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n\r\n I believe CI isn't reporting some GPU test issues because both the version of cudnn in the environment [that we set](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/ci/docker/runtime_functions.sh#L815) and the cudnn version [set by the image](https://gitlab.com/nvidia/cuda/blob/ubuntu16.04/9.1/devel/cudnn7/Dockerfile#L5) are lower than what is required for some tests [eg](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blame/master/tests/python/gpu/test_gluon_gpu.py#L85) by the test. \r\n\r\nSo, as it is in the example linked above, the test just ensures an error is raised. I don't know if (m)any of the cudnn functions are being tested right now. Maybe there are bugs slipping through.\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps the base image for GPU instances to CUDA v10.0. Furthermore, it updates the test functions to use the cuDNN version variable given by the environment, and only use 7.0.3 by default, if nothing is

Description ##\r\nUpgrade the dmlc-core dependency to the latest commit. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- relevant fixes for MXNet: https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/511

Description ##\r\nThis add operators to the linalg namespace to \r\n- extract a diagonal from a single or a batch of square matrices\r\n- construct a single or a batch of square diagonal matrices\r\n- extract a triangle from a single or a batch of square matrices\r\n- construct a single or a batch of square triangular matrices\r\n\r\nThis operators are useful for various tasks when working with linear algebra. We have a specific use case already where batches of triangular matrices exist and the non-zero entries above/below some diagonal must be rearranged as 1-d tensors. \r\n\r\nThere are various variants of such diagonal/triangular matrix manipulation in numpy (tril/triu/diag/diagonal/diagflat) and also one already in MXNet (diag-operator). Unfortunately without real consistency. MXNet's current  diag operator is consistent with numpy's diag. So it lacks any notion of batches of matrices which is a fundamental concept for all linalg-operators.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to be useful to write the \"one fits all\" operator for all types of manipulation of diagonal/triangular matrix operations. So this PR rather provides a consistent mechanism that can be used in the context of \"linalg\"-namespace and supports the usual operations that people need when they do advanced linear algebra. In particular, it does support the same level of batched matrix support, the same data types, diagonal and triangular matrices and enough flexibility to deal also with diagonal/triangular matrices that are defined by other than the main diagonal.\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ X] Changes are complete (i.e. I

Description ##\r\nIn the previous [Fit-API design doc](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Gluon+Fit+API+-+Tech+Design#GluonFitAPI-TechDesign-Estimatorclass) , training statistics was stored in a dictionary,  some values are stored as a list such learning rates and training accuraccy over epochs. users has to understand the underlying data structure inorder to  access the statistics. \r\nThis PR improves how event handlers access train stats, and reduced empty method call in event handlers to improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

we have inconsistent allocation and deallocation behaviors among storage managers. There are two major observations:\r\n1. Different storage managers handle size zero allocation differently. For example, we round the size (0) to the page size (4096 bytes) in [GPUPooledStorageManager](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/storage/pooled_storage_manager.h#L105); we perform aligned allocation (16/64 bytes) in [CPUDeviceStorage](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/storage/cpu_device_storage.h#L73); we do not round up the size in [PinnedMemoryStorage](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/storage/pinned_memory_storage.h#L55).\r\n2. We allocated memory for size 0 storage handle in some storage managers but its memory was not freed because we skipped calling Free when size == 0. This caused memory leaks #13951 #14358 \r\n\r\nThese inconsistencies make it error-prone to write code. In this PR, we tidy up the storage allocation and deallocation behaviors by doing:\r\n1. For size 0 storage handle (e.g. mx.nd.array([]), mx.nd.ones(0)), we skip allocating memory in all storage managers and set dtpr to nullptr in storage handle.\r\n2. We perform sanity check (if dptr is nullptr) in Free/DirectFree APIs to ensure sane behavior of memory deallocation.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #13951, fixes #14358\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-20T17:47:32Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T04:33:51Z","closed_at":"2019-03-28T02:40:31Z","merged_at":"2019-03-28T02:40:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"645c778b22ce9e2c7fdaa89b5a0128a6bd937ff2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nI fixed the tutorials that are currently breaking the nightly tests.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14401\r\n\r\nI also removed the matrix-factorization example that was failing for some other reason. We will redo this tutorial.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-19T17:38:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T02:33:25Z","closed_at":"2019-03-22T02:33:24Z","merged_at":"2019-03-22T02:33:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"29e13b4cbffcf47d3006b9478e242683136fff82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nAdds the enforce determinism setting when running the backwards compatibility checker to avoid flaky issues due to non-deterministic operators. This was made based on discussion of #14234.\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu @piyushghai @samskalicky\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nA multiclass metric equivalent to `mxnet.metric.MCC` can be derived from `mxnet.metric.PearsonCorrelation` with the addition of an `.argmax()` on preds.  I'd like to document this use case of Pearson and provide it behind a metric named \"PCC\" to simplify extending examples from F1 and MCC to multiclass predictions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-18T21:14:09Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T18:23:45Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T01:59:37Z","merged_at":"2019-04-10T01:59:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6516cc133106f44e247f9ed45165226e3682b62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Customized kernel for GPU\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nbenchmark results on sample workload from #14124:\r\nforward only: 48.589637756347656 ms

Description ##\r\n- The analog of `numpy.allclose(a, b, rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08, equal_nan=False)` is implemented as a MxNet operator:\r\n```\r\n    mx.nd.contrib.allclose(a, b, rtol, atol, equal_nan)\r\n```\r\n- For now, besides the unit test `test_allclose_function()`, this method is used only in\r\n```\r\ndef assert_almost_equal(a, b, rtol=None, atol=None, names=('a', 'b'), equal_nan=False)\r\n```\r\nwhere parameter **a** or/and **b** could be defined also as  `mx.nd.array`(s):\r\n```\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    a : np.ndarray or mx.nd.array\r\n    b : np.ndarray or mx.nd.array\r\n```\r\n- When calling `assert_almost_equal`, no more `asnumpy()` conversion needed. It will be done automatically (in `assert_almost_equal`), if \r\n     (a) **a** or **b** has no attribute \"context\" OR \r\n     (b) these attributes are different.\r\n\r\n- The elimination of `asnumpy()` conversions and the use of `mx.nd.contrib.allclose(...)` for `mx.nd.array`'s allows to achieve 5-7x speedup for GPU tests that use long arrays.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nMost of the changed files, were  changed because of the eliminations of `asnumpy()` conversions which were used when `assert_almost_equal` function is called.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-15T22:36:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T16:38:00Z","closed_at":"2019-10-15T22:56:44Z","merged_at":"2019-10-15T22:56:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"06438ab7a3099de1937f25ce758f687ff3771de7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe scope of this PR is to add missing exception handling to the examples. In future, if the underlying MXNet code throws any exception, the example will catch this exception and fail gracefully instead of crashing due to unhandled exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [y] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [y] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-15T21:12:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T18:10:28Z","closed_at":"2019-04-02T23:23:55Z","merged_at":"2019-04-02T23:23:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e4ee992f90e7da6cf52fb2664f7aaeffa8ccb62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":273991937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzM5OTE5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C++","name":"C++","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Related

Description ##\r\nIn the recommender example, the for loop uses `i` for enumeration, but then `i` is also used within the loop for list comprehensions, which breaks their utility.  Instead of being an integer, `i` becomes an mx.nd.array\r\n\r\nresolves #14439\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T20:10:25Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T18:35:28Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T18:35:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca5f81121aee60e2410c06290421149c8bf7f6e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Gluon, we defer initialization for some parameters until their shapes are known after the first forward pass. This makes it difficult for us to sync parameters among workers when we conduct distributed training using MXNet + Horovod with different random seeds for workers. More details can be found in this [Horovod issue](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/issues/895). \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a post_init_callback to Gluon Parameter which will be called after the parameter is initialized. With this callback, parameters can be synced among workers once they are initialized. The typical usage of this callback in Horovod will be like this:\r\n```\r\nrandom.seed(hvd.local_rank())\r\ndata = ..\r\nmodel = mx.gluon.nn.Dense(10)\r\nmodel.initialize(post_init_callback=hvd.broadcast_parameters)\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T19:36:45Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T04:38:58Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T04:38:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d001c66c19b8cdc299f37cd4c98db3b55f6e0aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nHi! there.\r\nFixed: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14391\r\nNow, ndarray.as_in_context() copies the gradient to the new context.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add a new arguments `copy_grad` in `mx.nd.as_in_context` and `mx.nd.copyto`\r\n- [x] Add unit-test in `test_ndarray.py`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-14T04:13:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T07:58:53Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T07:58:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6af0e7e0b111d61778f5c6108b9d4e0865acb26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/14427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/059061b0c8a07757d85abe734028bfd310502d66","head":{"label":"wkcn:fix_ndarray_as_in_context","ref":"fix_ndarray_as_in_context","sha":"059061b0c8a07757d85abe734028bfd310502d66","user":{"login":"wkcn","id":3415417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3415417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn","html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115596906,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1OTY5MDY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wkcn/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wkcn","id":3415417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTU0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3415417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn","html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wkcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wkcn/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14245\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10416\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add a check for the presence of kernel in attrs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTest code for Pooling visualization crash (after fix):\r\n```\r\nimport

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nSymbolBlock uses `Block.__repr__` when `print(SymbolBlock)` is executed. In `Block.__repr__`, data is printed only if it is of type Block. Adding a `__repr__` to SymbolBlock class that prints the output symbol. This behavior is similar to printing pure Symbol API.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13616\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add a __repr__ for SymbolBlock\r\nExecuting\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet.gluon.model_zoo import vision\r\n\r\nalexnet = vision.alexnet(pretrained=True)\r\nalexnet.initialize()\r\nalexnet.hybridize()\r\nalexnet(mx.random.uniform(shape=(1,3,224,224)))\r\nalexnet.export(\"./alexnet\")\r\n\r\nblock = mx.gluon.nn.SymbolBlock.imports('alexnet-symbol.json', ['data'], 'alexnet-0000.params')\r\nprint(block)\r\n```\r\ngives the output\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nSymbolBlock(\r\n\r\n)\r\n```\r\n**After change**\r\n```\r\nSymbolBlock(\r\n<Symbol alexnet0_dense2_fwd> : 1 -> 1\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample with a model with more than one output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\ntopk = mx.sym.topk(data, k=3, ret_typ='both')\r\nctx = mx.cpu()\r\n\r\npre_trained = gluon.nn.SymbolBlock(outputs=topk, inputs=data)\r\nprint (pre_trained)\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nSymbolBlock(\r\n<Symbol topk2> : 1 -> 2\r\n)\r\n```\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @Ishitori

Description ##\r\n\r\nBackports the windows ci changes to v1.4.x branch. I've had to drop the julia tests for windows cpu, since those were added with a different Julia related PR.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs: #14355 and #14336\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix #14402 where division by zero occurs in relative difference calculation, making `arange` tests fail.\r\nSolution: if `diff` is near 0f, i.e < `Float.MinPositiveValue` just return it instead of dividing by `norm`.\r\n\r\nAlso ~~increase number of test cases to 10000~~ add test cases where `arange` produces NDArray of [0.0f] to catch this. Test is not flaky anymore.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n#14413 @lanking520

is the PR to the numpy branch, so please be aware it is not aimed for production until the numpy branch is merged successfully)\r\n\r\nThis PR in part of progress of #14323, which contains improvement of the following contrib operators.\r\n\r\n- [x] adamw-inl.h\r\n- [x] adaptive_avg_pooling-inl.h\r\n- [x] bilinear_resize-inl.h\r\n- [x] bounding_box-inl.h\r\n- [x] count_sketch-inl.h\r\n- [x] deformable_convolution-inl.h\r\n- [x] fft-inl.h\r\n- [x] ifft-inl.h\r\n- [x] index_copy-inl.h\r\n- [x] multi_proposal-inl.h\r\n- [x] proposal-inl.h\r\n- [x] quadratic_op-inl.h\r\n- [x] sync_batch_norm-inl.h\r\n- [x] transformer-inl.h\r\n\r\nIn addition to the header files assigned to me, I also change some of the following `.cc` files which relates to `ndim`. I am not 100% sure about the coverage, so reviewers please let me know if there is anything I left.\r\n- [x] boolean_mask.cc\r\n- [x] dgl_graph.cc\r\n- [x] nnvm_to_onnx.cc\r\n- [x] optimizer_op.cc\r\n\r\nThe contrib operators are mostly irregular workloads coming from many contributors, which is one of the most difficult part (another difficult part is customized/python operators). I am trying my best not to break it. However, if there is anything I didn't take into consideration, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to skip quantizing FullyConnected layers when its inputs are signed int8 and the subgraph backend is set to MKLDNN, due to the limitation in current version of MKL-DNN. This feature will be enabled when MKL-DNN is upgraded to 0.18 or higher.\r\nFor not using MKLDNN subgraph backend (in general mode), users can still use both int8 and uint8 quantized FullyConnected for CPU platform (in this case, int8 will go to IGEMM path, but not providing requantize/dequantize fusion feature).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

Description ##\r\nAdd nightly integration tests for fit() API using CNN models.\r\nThis PR depends on the parent PR for fit() API #14346\r\nJIRA epic: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1333\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNet-1343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1343)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- test_estimator_cnn_cpu: test on cpu using synthetic data on alexnet, resnet18_v1, FCN\r\n- test_estimator_cnn_gpu: test on gpu using MNIST dataset on resnet18_v1 and verify training accuracy\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-12T22:59:58Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T22:12:57Z","closed_at":"2019-04-03T22:12:57Z","merged_at":"2019-04-03T22:12:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1ef99ae4f84da2fbd9c25115040e612e7250323","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-11T22:53:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T22:11:40Z","closed_at":"2019-03-13T20:07:20Z","merged_at":"2019-03-13T20:07:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"4432af1f47a439517eff9a21bef23ef7ae5e4aa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1085340072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg1MzQwMDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Java","name":"Java","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Label

Description ##\r\nThis PR is a response to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14368 and is now ready for merging.  The first step here was to recreate the Windows CI failure, along with additional debugging output to show whether the intended bulking environment variable settings were making it to the point of use.  I learned that the test's repeated setting and altering of environment variables was not getting through to the C++ runtime under Windows, which apparently gets a copy of the environment at process start-up.  The fix was to spawn a new test process for each setting of different environment variables, as is already done for the gluon version of these same tests.\r\n\r\nThanks to @perdasilva for identifying this issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the

Description ##\r\n@DickJC123 has reported the engine crash in #14329 which is related to my early PR on ASAN fix (#14223), this PR tries to fix the crash and restores the CI bypass in #14338.\r\n\r\nAfter reproducing the crash in docker, I found it happens when trying to destruct resources using `Storage` singleton in engine shutdown phase. So I added shared_ptr in threaded engine to force `Storage` to destruct after engine cleanup.\r\n\r\nThus, the crash has two properties:\r\n1. It doesn't happen all the time and is hard to reproduce because the destruction order of static variable is almost undefined in c++, which causes many similar bugs, #309 for example. For the time being, we can only add patches of shared_ptr when crash happens.\r\n2. It happens in `test_convolution_multiple_streams` because sub-process is used to run tests, leading to 6 engine shutdown phases in one single test.\r\n\r\nIn order to verify the fix, 100 times of `test_convolution_multiple_streams` is executed without crash.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts
