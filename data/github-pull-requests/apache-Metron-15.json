use an alternative AWS region, the user has to manually define the new AWS region along with lookup and redefine the Centos 6 AMI identifier that applies for their chosen region. The AMI identifiers can be difficult to find as they are not on the primary page for the CentOS 6 image.\n\nThis was simplified so that a user only has to specify the region they wish to deploy Metron to. The user no longer has to lookup and redefine the AMI identifier.  At the same time, the user can choose to override the `image` setting to override and use a specific AMI identifier, if desired.\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T17:29:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:31Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T14:59:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c1c6d074f1c9c8ec845595ba31464dbc2fedcf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/548930e3715657531c4c970bed048342b810a6b2","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-281","ref":"METRON-281","sha":"548930e3715657531c4c970bed048342b810a6b2","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-243)\n\nI have a working theory on this one.  I will need some additional testing, but I wanted to get some eyeballs on this to validate my thought process.  I would love it if others were to run this through full AWS deployments and report their results.\n#### Problem\n\nKibana reports this error in the web interface when accessing the Metron Dashboard.  THis does not occur on Vagrant deployments.  This occurs sometimes on AWS deployments.\n\n```\n[unsupported_operation_exception] custom format isn't supported\n```\n#### Root Cause\n\nThe dashboard expects certain data types for the Snort, Bro, and YAF indices. If the indices were created WITHOUT the index template definitions, the dashboard will throw this error.\n\nIn some cases, the index templates that appear to be properly installed during deployment, are later dropped when Elasticsearch is restarted by Monit. This causes Kibana to report this error. Now what might cause the index templates to go missing?  Here are the steps that can cause this to occur.\n- The 'elasticsearch' role installs Elasticsearch on each node in the 'search' host group. After installation, Elasticsearch is not yet started.\n- In the next step, the 'metron_elasticsearch_templates' role uses Ansible's 'run_once' functionality. The effect of using 'run_once' is that Ansible chooses a single node in the 'search' host group; let's call this host ES1. \n- Only on ES1, Elasticsearch is started, the index templates are installed, and then the index templates are validated. We effectively have a single node Elasticsearch cluster at this point.\n- After all components have been installed, the 'monit-start' role ensures that all services are stopped across the cluster. At this point the single-node Elasticsearch cluster, which was left running, is shutdown. \n- The 'monit-start' role then determines which services need started and starts them. At this point all of the Elasticsearch nodes are started which creates a multi-node Elasticsearch cluster.\n- Here is the sticky wicket...\n  - If ES1 is elected master, then the index template that was previously configured is propagated to the other nodes in the cluster.\n  - If ES1 is not elected master, then the index template is forgotten as the master knows nothing about them.\n\nThis explains why it occurs sometimes, but not all the time for AWS deployments.\nThis would also explain why the problem never occurs on Vagrant deployments.\n#### Fix\n\nThis PR ensures that ALL Elasticsearch nodes are started when the index templates are configured.  A side effect is that the index templates are installed multiple times, once per host in the cluster.  This does not cause a problem necessarily, but is

Problem\n\nThere are some visuals in the default dashboard that cross multiple indices.  The only way to do this via Kibana's web interface, is to create a \"*\" or wildcard index.  Unfortunately, this can also pull in other unrelated indices that could potentially impact the functioning of the dashboard.\n\nFor example, in this specific scenario an additional index was added that had the same field name, but a different data type than Snort, YAF, and Bro.  This thoroughly confused Kibana and caused it to report the following error when viewing Metron's Dashboard.\n\n```\nError: [unsupported_operation_exception] custom format isn't supported\n```\n#### Solution\n\nIf you modify the JSON used to create the .kibana index manually, there is a way to specify multiple indexes for a visualization instead of using a wildcard index pattern.  Previously, there were multiple visuals with index references as follows.\n\n```\n{\\\"index\\\":\\\"*\\\"\n```\n\nThese have all been changed to specifically reference the 3 default sensors.\n\n```\n{\\\"index\\\":[\\\"yaf*\\\", \\\"bro*\\\", \\\"snort*\\\"]\n```\n\nThis ensures that no other indices can impact the default dashboard.\n\nThis was tested by deploying to an AWS cluster.  The dashboard was able to function in the presence of the same index that had previously broken it.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T19:31:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:31Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T18:45:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89e99de5e712ac2300767629dbacaae899f42d5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/54930f0f6cbeb03ecfb88ab4c44aa3bbffa7df4e","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-252","ref":"METRON-252","sha":"54930f0f6cbeb03ecfb88ab4c44aa3bbffa7df4e","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

was previously using the IPv4 address of the `eth0` network interface as its HOME_NET.  This is a problem, of course, if there is no such interface.  The deployment was failing when run on hosts that do not have an `eth0` network interface.\n\nThis fix uses the IPv4 address of the `sniff_interface` as a sensible default.  This works fine for most development or demo builds of Metron.  For other deployments, the user can override `snort_home_net` to define this value appropriately for their environment.\n\nIn the case of using canned or replayed pcap data for testing, this value also needs to be adjusted based on the pcap data.  For this scenario, I altered 'sensor-test-mode' to use a `HOME_NET` of `any` so that it correctly alerts on every packet seen.\n","created_at":"2016-06-21T21:43:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:31Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T13:56:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32623abf900bea5f3fc387c0466febe35df9a1ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/21a2bcad820f008801c6a7f16d424d3f8ca3f4b3","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-247","ref":"METRON-247","sha":"21a2bcad820f008801c6a7f16d424d3f8ca3f4b3","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

should have a NOOP Writer that will sleep at random. This will help differentiate write slowdowns between index misconfiguration and storm/kafka misconfiguration.\n\nIt should be configurable from the object as well as from zookeeper.\n- In zookeeper, the \"noopLatency\" field should be a string defining the latency.\n- On the object, there should be a \"withLatency\" function which allows you to define the latency.\n\nThe latency is defined via string in one of two modes:\n- An integer which provides a fixed latency\n- A comma separated range (i.e. \"10, 20\") which allows for a random latency between the

the process of testing with Vagrant, but wanted to get this in front of people for review.\n\nRelevant Jira:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-235\n\nIn the process of upgrading to Kibana 4, we lost our about to query/filter pcap results. This PR exposes the 2 methods for filtering PCAP data, fixed parameters and the \"Stellar\" query language, via a command line tool. The tool is executed via ${metron_home}/bin/pcap_query.sh\n\n**Note**: I also tweaked the mem settings for Ambari mapreduce to get around persistent OOM errors - mapreduce container sizes (mapreduce.[map | reduce].memory.mb) have been increased to 1.2 GiB, mapreduce.[map | reduce].java.opts have been increased to 1 GiB.\n# PR Testing Instructions:\n\nGet PCAP data into Metron: Install and setup pycapa - the instructions below reference/mirror those in [PR-93](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/93#issue-151705836)\n1. Install the pycapa library & utility `$ cd /opt/pycapa/pycapa && pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup.py install`\n2. (if using singlenode vagrant) Kill the enrichment and sensor topologies via for i in bro enrichment yaf snort;do storm kill $i;done\n3. Start the pcap topology via /usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh\n4. Start the pycapa packet capture producer on eth1 via /usr/bin/pycapa --producer --topic pcap -i eth1 -k node1:6667\n5. Watch the topology in the Storm UI and kill the packet capture utility from before when the number of packets ingested is over 1k.\n6. Ensure that at at least 2 files exist on HDFS by running hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap\n7. Choose a file (denoted by $FILE) and dump a few of the contents using the pcap_inspector utility via /usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/pcap_inspector.sh -i $FILE -n 5\n8. Choose one of the lines and note the source ip/port and dest ip/port as well as the protocol.\n9. Note that when you run the commands below, the resulting file will be placed in the execution directory where you kicked off the job from.\n### Fixed filter\n1. Run a fixed filter query by executing the following command with the values noted above (match your start_time format to the date format provided - default is to use millis since epoch)\n2. `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/pcap_query.sh fixed -st <start_time> -df \"yyyyMMdd\" -sa <address> -da <address> -sp <port> -dp <port> -p <protocol_num>`\n3. Verify the MR job finishes successfully. Upon completion, you should see a file named with the current datestamp in your current directory, e.g. pcap-data-20160617160549737+0000.pcap\n4. Copy the file to your local machine and verify you can open it in Wireshark\n### Query filter\n1. Run a Stellar query filter query by executing a command similar to the following, with the values noted above (match your start_time format to the date format provided - default is to use millis since epoch)\n2. `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/pcap_query.sh query -st \"20160617\" -df \"yyyyMMdd\" -query \"ip_src_addr == '192.168.1.1' and ip_src_port == '49197' and ip_dst_addr == '192.168.1.2' and ip_dst_port == '80' and protocol == '6'\"`\n3.

with quick-dev-platform. \n\nCurrently this will allow the use of custom Elasticsearch templates by adding *.template files to the metron_streaming/files/es_templates directory. Deployment will pick them up and send them to the index using the basename without the .template extension as the template name.\n\nI'm interested if others think that I should add an optional custom-defined directory name to pick up additional templates. Easy to do, but I wasn't sure it was needed.\n\nThis can be verified by running deployment and then running GET _template/\\* using your index-putter of choice (curl, sense, whatever). You should see a template that corresponds to each filename.\n\ne.g. for Bro:\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"bro_index\": {\n      \"order\": 0,\n      \"template\": \"bro_index*\",\n      \"settings\": {},\n      \"mappings\": {\n         \"bro_doc\": {\n            \"_timestamp\": {\n               \"enabled\": true\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n               \"enrichments:geo:ip_dst_addr:location_point\": {\n                  \"type\": \"geo_point\"\n               },\n               \"timestamp\": {\n                  \"format\": \"epoch_millis\",\n                  \"type\": \"date\"\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      },\n      \"aliases\": {}\n

[METRON-211](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-211)\n\nDuring Metron deployment a fixed number of Kafka topics are created to support the input streams supported by Metron \"out of the box\" including Bro, YAF, and Snort. As new parsers are created, new Kafka topics will be needed to support those parsers that go beyond this default set of topics.\n\nUse cases for this functionality would include the following.\n- A developer needs to define new Kafka topics associated with parsers that he or she creates. A developer should also be able to define the replication factor, partition count, and retention size associated with those topics.\n- An operator needs to define the Kafka topics that get created when deploying new parsers to a Metron environment. The operator needs to define a replication factor, partition count and retention size that is appropriate for the target environment.\n\nAn example showing the definition of two topics that will be created, each with different partitions, replication and retention settings.\n\n```\ntopics_to_create:\n  - { topic: \"bluecoat\", num_partitions: 10, replication_factor: 3, retention_gb: 10 }\n  - { topic: \"enrichments\", num_partitions: 21, replication_factor: 3, retention_gb: 120 }\n```\n#### Changes\n- Removed `hadoop_setup` role\n- Kafka topics needed by Metron are now created in a new `metron_kafka_topics` role\n  - The Kafka topics that are created are defined via properties.\n  - Each Kafka topic can have unique retention, replication, and partition settings.\n  - Using the `metron_kafka_topics` host group to target this role at hosts.\n- HBase tables needed by Metron are now created in a new `metron_hbase_tables` role\n  - The HBase tables that are created are defined via properties.\n  - Using the `metron_hbase_tables` host groups to target this role at hosts.\n- Using separate host groups to target each role. This is more flexible than before as there may not be a single host with both Kafka and HBase clients installed.\n","created_at":"2016-06-06T20:50:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:31Z","closed_at":"2016-06-14T19:07:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"502081cf9e20db81e3dcc6abfeca5056f3aefad0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/95de8b4247d5320b11f5d28f8e3c7ca2191738a2","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-211","ref":"METRON-211","sha":"95de8b4247d5320b11f5d28f8e3c7ca2191738a2","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

to the domain specific query language, it would be nice to have a domain specific language for transformations which is used as an optional FieldTransformation implementation.\n- A fixed set of transformation functions:\n  - `TO_LOWER(string)` : Transforms the first argument to a lowercase string\n  - `TO_UPPER(string)` : Transforms the first argument to an uppercase string\n  - `TO_STRING(string)` : Transforms the first argument to a string\n  - `TO_INTEGER(x)` : Transforms the first argument to an integer\n  - `TO_DOUBLE(x)` : Transforms the first argument to a double\n  - `TRIM(string)` : Trims whitespace from both sides of a string.\n  - `JOIN(list, delim)` : Joins the components of the list with the specified delimiter\n  - `SPLIT(string, delim)` : Splits the string by the delimiter.  Returns a list.\n  - `GET_FIRST(list)` : Returns the first element of the list\n  - `GET_LAST(list)` : Returns the last element of the list\n  - `GET(list, i)` : Returns the i'th element of the list (i is 0-based).\n  - `MAP_GET(key, map, default)` : Returns the value associated with the key in the map.  If the key does not exist, the default will   be returned.  If the default is unspecified, then null will be returned.\n  - `DOMAIN_TO_TLD(domain)` : Returns the TLD of the domain.\n  - `DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD(domain)` : Remove the TLD of the domain.\n  - `REMOVE_TLD(domain)` : Removes the TLD from the domain.\n  - `URL_TO_HOST(url)` : Returns the host from a URL\n  - `URL_TO_PROTOCOL(url)` : Returns the protocol from a URL\n  - `URL_TO_PORT(url)` : Returns the port from a URL\n  - `URL_TO_PATH(url)` : Returns the path from a URL\n  - `TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP(dateTime, format, timezone)` : Returns the epoch timestamp of the `dateTime` given the `format`.  If the format does not have a timestamp and you wish to assume a given timestamp, you may specify the `timezone` optionally.\n- A FieldTransformer implementation, `MTL` which exposes the transformation language\n\nExample MTL transformation:\n\nConsider the following sensor parser config to add three new fields to a\nmessage:\n- `utc_timestamp` : The unix epoch timestamp based on the `timestamp` field, a `dc` field which is the data center the message comes     from and a `dc2tz` map mapping data centers to timezones\n- `url_host` : The host associated with the url in the `url` field\n- `url_protocol` : The protocol associated with the url in the `url` field\n\n```\n{\n...\n    \"fieldTransformations\" : [\n          {\n           \"transformation\" : \"MTL\"\n          ,\"output\" : [ \"utc_timestamp\", \"url_host\", \"url_protocol\" ]\n          ,\"config\" : {\n            \"utc_timestamp\" : \"TO_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP(timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd\nHH:mm:ss', MAP_GET(dc, dc2tz, 'UTC') )\"\n           ,\"url_host\" : \"URL_TO_HOST(url)\"\n           ,\"url_protocol\" : \"URL_TO_PROTOCOL(url)\"\n                      }\n          }\n                      ]\n   ,\"parserConfig\" : {\n      \"dc2tz\" : {\n                \"nyc\" : \"EST\"\n               ,\"la\" : \"PST\"\n               ,\"london\" : \"UTC\"\n                }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `dc2tz` map is in the parser config, so it is accessible\nin the

the user to specify field level or message level validations to ensure messages coming from the parser are valid. For instance, allow the ability ensure that a field is an IPv4 address.\nIf a field is invalid, send to a separate stream from the parser bolt. Follow-on work should be done to send this stream to the index for after-the-fact inspection.\n\nI added the following validation functions:\n- `MQL` : Execute a Query Language statement.  Expects the query string in the `condition` field of the config.\n- `IP` : Validates that the input fields are an IP addres.  By default, if no configuration is set, it assumes `IPV4`, but you can specify        the type by passing in the config by passing in `type` with either `IPV6` or `IPV4`.\n- `DOMAIN` : Validates that the fields are all domains.\n- `EMAIL` : Validates that the fields are all email addresses\n- `URL` : Validates that the fields are all URLs\n- `DATE` : Validates that the fields are a date.  Expects `format` in the config.\n- `INTEGER` : Validates that the fields are an integer.  String representation of an integer is allowed.\n- `REGEX_MATCH` : Validates that the fields match a regex.  Expects `pattern` in the config.\n- `NOT_EMPTY` : Validates that the fields exist and are not empty (after trimming.)\n\nBecause of the nice overlap, I also added these functions to the query language, so query language rules can take advantage of `IS_IP(field1)` for instance.\n","created_at":"2016-05-27T13:55:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T00:11:47Z","closed_at":"2016-06-02T00:11:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db9191cd2654610e6f7f01ba1602a0f9b9b40bc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/46ec638644f75ebaa910a4bf5bbd868ae7e22dc6","head":{"label":"cestella:validation","ref":"validation","sha":"46ec638644f75ebaa910a4bf5bbd868ae7e22dc6","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

pull request includes several changes related to optimizing configuration for parser topologies.  Currently the process for adding parsers includes several unnecessary steps with configuration being duplicated in various places.  The high level changes are:\n- Sensor specific config files (parser and enrichment) were reorganized into their respective projects\n- Parser topology configuration is now dynamically driven by simple sensor specific json config files\n- Zookeeper configuration infrastructure was extended to support parser topologies\n- Ansible scripts were updated to load parser configurations to zookeeper and call parser topology startup scripts correctly.\n- Unit and integration tests were updated to accommodate parser topology changes and provide coverage for new classes.\n- Updated tools for reading and writing sensor parser configs to zookeeper\n- Removed generic configuration feature as it is not being used anywhere\n- Changed enrichment integration and unit tests to use a dedicated test config instead of reusing a sensor specific enrichment config\n- Moved zookeeper configuration functions to a new component in the integration testing framework.\n- Abstracted integration test validations to facilitate more readable code and reusable validations\n\nThe major benefits of this pull request are a simpler process for adding more parsers and additional test coverage for sensor specific parser configurations.  This has been integration tested and verified with a full-dev-platform build.\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T22:13:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T14:38:38Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T14:38:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5e8fc67549df2c020899c01e45243af24a27c96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/604e6122a6df75d31e3a117bcf2f6a3e0e938470","head":{"label":"merrimanr:METRON-142","ref":"METRON-142","sha":"604e6122a6df75d31e3a117bcf2f6a3e0e938470","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"00f8588d8cf2f309d01f2da8b67d0025d262d992","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47607561,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzYwNzU2MQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"apache/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron","description":"Apache

Changes\n##### METRON-85\n\nAddressed bug that caused Amazon EC2 deployment to always wait a fixed 5 minutes instead of continuing when the hosts are actually ready\n##### METRON-132\n\nDecouple Install and Start of System Components\n- Decouples the installation of components from the starting of them.  A component can be installed, but not started.\n- Define which services need started as a property.  \n- Enables different deployments to start more or fewer services.  A development platform can start no services by default, while an Amazon EC2 cluster can start all services.\n- For example, to start only component related to YAF ingestion, run the following.\n  \n  ```\n  services_to_start:\n    - mysql\n    - elasticsearch\n    - enrichment\n    - yaf-parser\n    - yaf\n  ```\n##### METRON-132\n\nMonit Integration\n- Leverages Monit as a process watchdog to manage sensors, topologies, and core services.\n- Monit web interface exposed at http://hostname:2812 which can be used to start, stop, check status of any of the sensors or topologies.\n- When monitoring is enabled (on by default) if a process dies, it will be restarted.\n- Will not monitor a service that is not installed.\n- Monit command line tools simplify the process of managing Metron components\n  \n  For example, tired of the noise from your laptop fan when running Metron's 'single node vagrant'?  This will quiet her down.  Finally, peace and quiet!\n  \n  ```\n  monit stop all\n  ```\n  \n  Need to work on a single ingest feed?\n  \n  ```\n  monit start bro\n  monit start bro-parser\n  ```\n  \n  Getting cold and need some heat?  Start everything.\n  \n  ```\n  monit start all\n  ```\n  \n  Groups have also been defined to make things simpler.  For example, start all parser topologies.\n  \n  ```\n  monit -g parsers start\n  ```\n  \n  Start all components required to consume and enrich Bro data.\n  \n  ```\n  monit -g bro start\n  ```\n  \n  What is running?\n  \n  ```\n  monit summary\n  ```\n- The post-deployment report for Amazon-EC2 provides links to Monit's web interface.\n  \n  ```\n  ok: [localhost] => {\n    \"Success\": [\n        \"Apache Metron deployed successfully\",\n        \"   Metron          @ http://ec2-52-39-143-62.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000\",\n        \"   Ambari          @ http://ec2-52-39-4-93.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080\",\n        \"   Sensor Status   @ http://ec2-52-39-4-93.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2812\",\n        \"   Topology Status @ http://ec2-52-39-130-62.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2812\",\n        \"For additional information, see https://metron.incubator.apache.org/'\"\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n#### Validation\n##### Quick Dev Platform\n- Deploy\n- Open http://node1:2812\n- Ensure that all of the following services are running and visible in the Monit web interface.\n  - mysql, elasticsearch, pcap-service, metron-ui\n  - yaf, snort, snort-logs, bro, pcap-replay\n  - yaf-parser, bro-parser, snort-parser, enrichment\n- Login to node1 and validate the previous step by running `monit summary`\n- Run `monit stop all`\n- Ensure all services stopped on the host\n##### Amazon EC2\n- Deploy\n- Open http://ec2-host:2812 across each of the 10 nodes.\n- Ensure that all of the following services are running somewhere on the cluster.\n  - mysql, elasticsearch, pcap-service, metron-ui\n  - yaf, snort, snort-logs, bro, pcap-replay\n  - yaf-parser, bro-parser, snort-parser, enrichment\n- Login to a host and validate the previous step by running `monit summary`\n- Run `monit stop all` on the same host\n- Ensure all services stopped on the host\n","created_at":"2016-05-11T22:02:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:30Z","closed_at":"2016-05-13T21:29:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5d1ad76e737e39f7730c45feac35e28bae4fc4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/a672f2ae55a7ac4f479a2f93245985173c72ca40","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-132","ref":"METRON-132","sha":"a672f2ae55a7ac4f479a2f93245985173c72ca40","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

tested this by starting the full-dev-platform vagrant image. The logrotate.d config file was created. I ran logrotate with the -f option (force) to test the configuration and it worked properly.\n\nThe configuration is consistent with the other logrotate configs in metron, but I have a couple of questions, which perhaps should be posted elsewhere. These questions apply to most of the default Metron logrotate configurations:\n#1 - Should the pcap logs  be in their own directory like most other metron logs instead of /var/log/metron_pcapservice.log?\n#2 - Should we change to compress (gzip)?\n#3 - Regarding all logrotate configs, should we change them to use dateext? Currently it changes files like this:\n\n/var/log/metron_pcapservice.log.1\n/var/log/metron_pcapservice.log.2\n\nWhere, using dateext makes them:\n/var/log/metron_pcapservice.log.20160507\n/var/log/metron_pcapservice.log.20160508\n\nThe disadvantage to this is that even if you try to force the rotate  (-f), I don't think it will rotate because the date it would rotate to already exists. With the number, if just adds a new number.\n","created_at":"2016-05-09T18:02:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T21:26:53Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T21:26:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cee5b282ec3a70676708f928c05d4a2332a207f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/83785800b8027049dd4d488ab95ab25b8476ebd8","head":{"label":"jjonez:METRON-136_logrotate_pcapservice","ref":"METRON-136_logrotate_pcapservice","sha":"83785800b8027049dd4d488ab95ab25b8476ebd8","user":{"login":"jjonez","id":18617354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjE3MzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18617354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez","html_url":"https://github.com/jjonez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58275224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI3NTIyNA==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"jjonez/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jjonez","id":18617354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjE3MzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18617354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez","html_url":"https://github.com/jjonez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjonez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jjonez/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

have the ability to mark messages as part of the enrichment topology as threat alerts, but we have no ability to prioritize those alerts.\n\nWe should allow for the prioritization of messages that have some threat intelligence alert via a scoring mechanism. \n\nThe general idea is for each message from each sensor:\n1. Map threat conditions as defined by a lightweight query language to threat levels (a number).\n2. More than one condition may match a given message, so allow for the choice of aggregation functions.\n3. If the aggregated score is positive, then add a field (`threat.triage.level`) with the level to the JSON message.\n\nThe above configuration is done at the per-sensor level.\n\nAs part of this PR, the following were added out of necessity:\n- A query language DSL which is used in defining the conditions which map to threat levels.  Docs at [here](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-141/metron-platform/metron-common#query-language)\n- The addition of a `triageConfig` section to the sensor enrichment config.  Description at [here](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-141/metron-platform/metron-common#the-threatintel-configuration)\n- Actual documentation of our enrichment configuration.  Documentation at [here](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-141/metron-platform/metron-common#enrichment-configuration)\n- A rewrite of the `zk_load_configs.sh` utility to support both pushing and pulling configs (the threat triage rules are part of the configs and until we have a UI, we need to add them).

Addressed bug where `wait_for` was waiting for a fixed 5 minutes instead of continuing when the hosts are actually ready\n\nMETRON-132 Adds Monit as a process watchdog to manage all sensors and topologies.\n- Monit web interface exposed at http://hostname:2812 which can be used to start, stop, check status of any of the sensors or topologies.\n- When monitoring is enabled (on by default) if a process dies, it will be restarted.\n- Monit command line tools also simplify the process of managing Metron ingestion.\n  \n  For example, tired of the noise from your laptop fan when running Metron's 'single node vagrant'?  This will quiet her down.  Finally, peace and quiet!\n  \n  ```\n  monit stop all\n  ```\n  \n  Need to work on a single ingest feed?\n  \n  ```\n  monit start bro\n  monit start bro-topology\n  ```\n  \n  Getting cold and need some heat?  Start everything.\n  \n  ```\n  monit start all\n  ```\n- Post-deployment report for Amazon-EC2 provides links to Monit's web interface.\n  \n  ```\n  ok: [localhost] => {\n    \"Success\": [\n        \"Apache Metron deployed successfully\",\n        \"   Metron          @ http://ec2-52-39-143-62.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5000\",\n        \"   Ambari          @

the creation of the blogs detailing how to add parsers, several issues surfaced.  This pull request fixes those issues.  Includes:\n- a couple new parsers (bluecoat and squid) along with unit and integration tests\n- change to the grokparsertest to make it reusable for other grok based parsers\n- changes to the metron-parser jar to include site files and hadoop dependency\n- additional ansible scripts to rerun the metron-streaming role for the purpose of pushing out parser changes\n- fix to the enrichment topology to pass along data to elasticsearch when no enrichments have been configured

needs to know the URL of the Kafka Broker to send packet data to. During a standard deployment, such as single node vagrant or amazon-ec2, this URL needs to be retrieved from Ambari.  When using Pycapa to test other functionality, like fastcapa, Ambari is not used.  In these cases the URL need to be specified by the user instead of being retrieved from Ambari.\n\nThe Pycapa role at `metron-deployment/roles/pycapa` previously had a dependency on `ambari_gather_facts` through which it retrieved the Kafka Broker URL. This dependency was removed in METRON-110 which introduced this bug.\n### Changes\n- Changed the `ambari_gather_facts` Ansible role so that it only retrieves information from Ambari if the information is not already known.\n- Updated Pycapa so that the service start script can be installed or not depending on a variable.  As a sensor, we need the start script installed.  As a testing tool, we do not need the start script installed.\n- Update Fastcapa test environment so extra dummy variables are provided instead of having the process reach out to a nonexistent Ambari server.\n### Validation\n\nRunning Pycapa in Single Node Vagant provided the \"positive\" test, using Ambari to retrieve value, and using the Fastcapa Test Environment provided the \"negative\" test, using a user-provided value.\n- Single Node Vagrant Environment `cd metron-deploymet/vagrant/singlenode-vagrant; vagrant up`\n- Fastcapa Test Environment `cd metron-deployment/vagrant/fastcapa-vagrant; vagrant up`\n","created_at":"2016-04-28T18:50:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T19:41:30Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T22:01:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43ac0f5dccbd029e846853556e30388df77c0957","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/94/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/94/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/94/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/9b526e564d102cceefc31dbb90eea43a4859f1ba","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-123","ref":"METRON-123","sha":"9b526e564d102cceefc31dbb90eea43a4859f1ba","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

it stands, the existing approach to handling PCAP data has some issues handling high volume packet capture data.  With the advent of a DPDK plugin for capturing packet data, we are going to hit some limitations on the  throughput of consumption if we continue to try to push packet data into HBase at line-speed.\n\nFurthermore, storing PCAP data into HBase limits the range of filter queries that we can perform (i.e. only those expressible within the key).  As of now, we require all fields to be present (source IP/port, destination IP/port and protocol), rather than allowing any wildcards.\n\nTo address these issues, we should create a higher performance topology which attaches the appropriate header to the raw packet and timestamp read from Kafka (as placed onto kafka by the packet capture sensor) and appends this packet to a sequence file in HDFS.  The sequence file will be rolled based on number of packets or time (e.g. 1 hrs worth of packets in a given sequence file).\n\nOn the query side, we should adjust the middle tier service layer to start a MR job on the appropriate set of sequence files to filter out the appropriate packets.  NOTE: the UI modifications to make this reasonable for the end-user will need to be done in a follow-on JIRA.\n\nIn order to test this PR, I would suggest doing the following as the \"happy path\":\n1. Install the pycapa library & utility via instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa)\n2. (if using singlenode vagrant) Kill the enrichment and sensor topologies via `for i in bro enrichment yaf snort;do storm kill $i;done`\n3. Start the pcap topology via `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh`\n4. Start the pycapa packet capture producer on eth1 via `/usr/bin/pycapa --producer --topic pcap -i eth1 -k node1:6667`\n5. Watch the topology in the [Storm UI](http://node1:8744/index.html) and kill the packet capture utility from before when the number of packets ingested is over 1k.\n6. Ensure that at at least 2 files exist on HDFS by running `hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap`\n7. Choose a file (denoted by $FILE) and dump a few of the contents using the `pcap_inspector` utility via `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/pcap_inspector.sh -i $FILE -n 5`\n8. Choose one of the lines and note the source ip/port and dest ip/port\n9. Go to the kibana app at [http://node1:5000](http://node1:5000) on the singlenode vagrant (ymmv on ec2) and input that query in the kibana PCAP panel.\n10. Wait patiently while the MR job completes and the results are sent back in the form of a valid PCAP payload suitable for opening in wireshark\n11. Open in wireshark to ensure the payload is valid.\n\nIf the payload is not valid PCAP, then please look at the [job history](http://node1:19888/jobhistory) and note the reason for job failure if any.\n\nAlso, please note changes and addition to the documentation for the [pcap service](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-119/metron-streaming/metron-api) and [pcap backend](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/METRON-119/metron-platform/metron-pcap-backend).\n","created_at":"2016-04-28T18:01:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T16:28:45Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T16:28:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9280b46045b82d7e136540663281f631b959f0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/93/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/93/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/93/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/e4057916c5663ced326915d85eb3cf8ee0ecd555","head":{"label":"cestella:METRON-119","ref":"METRON-119","sha":"e4057916c5663ced326915d85eb3cf8ee0ecd555","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

it stands, the existing approach to handling PCAP data has some issues handling high volume packet capture data.  With the advent of a DPDK plugin for capturing packet data, we are going to hit some limitations on the  throughput of consumption if we continue to try to push packet data into HBase at line-speed.\n\nFurthermore, storing PCAP data into HBase limits the range of filter queries that we can perform (i.e. only those expressible within the key).  As of now, we require all fields to be present (source IP/port, destination IP/port and protocol), rather than allowing any wildcards.\n\nTo address these issues, we should create a higher performance topology which attaches the appropriate header to the raw packet and timestamp read from Kafka (as placed onto kafka by the packet capture sensor) and appends this packet to a sequence file in HDFS.  The sequence file will be rolled based on number of packets or time (e.g. 1 hrs worth of packets in a given sequence file).\n\nOn the query side, we should adjust the middle tier service layer to start a MR job on the appropriate set of sequence files to filter out the appropriate packets.  NOTE: the UI modifications to make this reasonable for the end-user will need to be done in a follow-on JIRA.\n\nIn order to test this PR, I would suggest doing the following as the \"happy path\":\n1. Install the pycapa library & utility via instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa)\n2. (if using singlenode vagrant) Kill the enrichment and sensor topologies via `for i in bro enrichment yaf snort;do storm kill $i;done`\n3. Start the pcap topology via `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh`\n4. Start the pycapa packet capture producer on eth1 via `/usr/bin/pycapa --producer --topic pcap -i eth1 -k node1:6667`\n5. Watch the topology in the [Storm UI](http://node1:8744/index.html) and kill the packet capture utility from before when the number of packets ingested is over 1k.\n6. Ensure that at at least 2 files exist on HDFS by running `hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap`\n7. Choose a file (denoted by $FILE) and dump a few of the contents using the `pcap_inspector` utility via `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/pcap_inspector.sh -i $FILE -n 5`\n8. Choose one of the lines and note the source ip/port and dest ip/port\n9. Go to the kibana app at [http://node1:5000](http://node1:5000) on the singlenode vagrant (ymmv on ec2) and input that query in the kibana PCAP panel.\n10. Wait patiently while the MR job completes and the results are sent back in the form of a valid PCAP payload suitable for opening in wireshark\n11. Open in wireshark to ensure the payload is valid.\n\nIf the payload is not valid PCAP, then please look at the [job history](http://node1:19888/jobhistory) and note the reason for job failure if

an Ansible role that performs automated deployment and setup of OpenTAXII services.  Functionality has also been added to fetch threat intel data from 3rd parties using TAXII.\n\nThis role has not been integrated into any of the deployments; Amazon or Vagrant.  Other things to keep in mind...\n- Python 2.7 is needed to support OpenTAXII, but CentOS 6 comes with Python 2.6.  The `centos-release-scl` repository is used to install Python 2.7 without impacting the existing Python 2.6.\n- OpenTAXII is installed in a virtual environment to maintain isolation.\n- The installation is currently backed by a sqlite database.  OpenTAXII can be configured with a proper database like MySQL, but that work has not been done.\n\n---\n# OpenTAXII\n\nInstalls [OpenTAXII](https://github.com/EclecticIQ/OpenTAXII) as a deamon that can be launched via a SysV service script.  The complementary client implementation, [Cabby](https://github.com/EclecticIQ/cabby) is also installed.\n\nOpenTAXII is a robust Python implementation of TAXII Services that delivers a rich feature set and friendly pythonic API.  [TAXII](https://stixproject.github.io/) (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a collection of specifications defining a set of services and message exchanges used for sharing cyber threat intelligence information between parties.\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter deployment completes the OpenTAXII service is installed and running.  A set of [Hail a TAXII](http://hailataxii.com/) threat intel collections have been defined and configured.  Use the `status` option to view the collections that have been defined.\n\n```\n$ service opentaxii status\nChecking opentaxii...                             Running\nguest.phishtank_com                                0\nguest.Abuse_ch                                     0\nguest.CyberCrime_Tracker                           0\nguest.EmergingThreats_rules                        0\nguest.Lehigh_edu                                   0\nguest.MalwareDomainList_Hostlist                   0\nguest.blutmagie_de_torExits                        0\nguest.dataForLast_7daysOnly                        0\nguest.dshield_BlockList                            0\n```\n\nNotice that each collections contain zero records.  None of the data is automatically synced during deployment.  To sync the data manually use the `sync` option as defined below.  The following example does not provide a begin and end time so the data will be fetched for the current day only.\n\n```\n# service opentaxii sync guest.blutmagie_de_torExits\n2016-04-21 20:34:42,511 INFO: Starting new HTTP connection (1): localhost\n2016-04-21 20:34:42,540 INFO: Response received for Inbox_Message from http://localhost:9000/services/inbox\n2016-04-21 20:34:42,542 INFO: Sending Inbox_Message to http://localhost:9000/services/inbox\n...\n2016-04-21 20:34:42,719 INFO: Response received for Poll_Request from http://localhost:9000/services/poll\n2016-04-21 20:34:42,719 INFO: Content blocks count: 1618, is partial: False\n```\n\nThe OpenTAXII service now contains 1,618 threat intel records indicating Tor Exit nodes.\n\n```\n[root@source ~]# service opentaxii status\nChecking opentaxii...

an Ansible role that performs automated deployment and setup of OpenTAXII services.  This role has not been integrated into any of the deployments; Amazon or Vagrant.  The integration will occur once all work related to the \"pcap ingest refresh\" is complete.\n\nOther things to keep in mind...\n- Python 2.7 is needed to support OpenTAXII, but CentOS 6 comes with Python 2.6.  The `centos-release-scl` repository is used to install Python 2.7 without impacting the existing Python 2.6.\n- OpenTAXII is installed in a virtual environment to maintain isolation.\n- The installation is currently backed by a sqlite database.  OpenTAXII can be configured with a proper database like MySQL, but that work has not been done.\n\n---\n# OpenTAXII\n\nInstalls [OpenTAXII](https://github.com/EclecticIQ/OpenTAXII) as a deamon that can be launched via a SysV service script.  The complementary client implementation, [Cabby](https://github.com/EclecticIQ/cabby) is also installed.\n\nOpenTAXII is a robust Python implementation of TAXII Services that delivers a rich feature set and friendly pythonic API.  [TAXII](https://stixproject.github.io/) (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a collection of specifications defining a set of services and message exchanges used for sharing cyber threat intelligence information between parties.\n## Usage\n### Service\n\nA standard SysV script has been installed to manage OpenTAXII.  The following functions are available.\n- `start` Start the opentaxii service\n- `stop` Stop the opentaxii service\n- `restart` Restart the opentaxii service\n- `status` Current status of the opentaxii service\n- `setup` Creates a set of collections and services to mirror the threat data made available at [Hail a TAXII](http://hailataxii.com/).  Running this will destroy all existing data.\n### Troubleshooting\n\nShould you need to explore the installation, here are instructions on doing so.\n\nOpenTAXII is installed in a virtual environment.  Before exploring the environment run the following commands to perform the necessary setup.  The specific paths may change depending on your Ansible settings.\n\n```\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64\ncd /usr/local/opentaxii\n. opentaxii-venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nExplore
