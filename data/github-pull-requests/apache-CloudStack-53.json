Description\r\n\r\nThis optimization aims to reduce volume attach slowness due to vmdk files search on datastore before creating the volume (search for `.vmdk`, `-flat.vmdk` and `-delta.vmdk` files to delete them if they exist). This search is not necessary when attaching a volume in Allocated state, due to volume files don't exist on datastore.\r\n\r\nOn large datastores, this search can cause volume attachness to be really slow, as we can see in this log lines:\r\n\r\n````\r\n13-mgmt.log:2016-11-02 10:16:33,136 INFO  [vmware.mo.DatastoreMO] (DirectAgent-931:ctx-5687d68e uscrlpdcsesx240.ads.autodesk.com,

What happens is that when a host is deleted, it goes through a list of all registered plugins and calls the deleteHost for each plugin. See `ResourceManagerImpl.java:dispatchToStateAdapters` and it stops as soon as someone returns a deleteAnswer. \r\n\r\nNow in case of ODL, it returns a valid answer irrespective of any condition. This causes the other plugins which are supposed to handle this delete request to be skipped. I am returning `null` here so that Cloudstack will continue further and keep calling other agents which can correctly handle the delete request.

Description\r\nIt was noticed that expunging instances with many vm snapshots took a look of time, as hypervisor received as many tasks as vm snapshots instance had, apart from the delete vm task. We propose a way to optimize this process for instances with vm snapshots by sending only one delete task to hypervisor, which will delete vm and its snapshots\r\n\r\n## Use cases\r\n\r\n1. deleteVMsnapohsot-> no changes to current behavior\r\n2. destroyVM with expunge=false ->  no actions to VMsnaphsot is performed at the moment. When VM cleanup thread is executed it will perform the same sequence as (3).

user can currently copy or register a template with only one zone at a time.\r\nThe idea of this feature is to allow the user to allow copying or registering of one template to multiple zones at the same time.\r\n\r\nFor RegisterTemplate and CopyTemplate APIs have been modified to add a new parameter called zoneIds. This is not compulsory to keep backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe UIs have been changes - When you add, the earlier select control for zones now is a multi select and you can choose multiple zones at the same time. \r\nFor CopyTemplate a new dialog has been added - this shows all the zones you can copy to and allows you to select multiple at a time.\r\n\r\nPlease see [CLOUDSTACK-9700](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9700) for more details. Snapshots of the UI have been attached there.","created_at":"2017-01-06T12:30:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T10:11:28Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T10:11:28Z","merged_at":"2017-06-06T10:11:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ee751e7477b0834763c8c8ba20ee12206074d1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592389048,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIzODkwNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:ready-for-merge","name":"status:ready-for-merge","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/49a862b223ea4bf41b793ef5a4a9da95ad1b1d59","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9700","sha":"49a862b223ea4bf41b793ef5a4a9da95ad1b1d59","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ed2f5731609e7e4bf791560f2170cb5ad44a47d2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Metrics view for each type of entity basically fires APIs and calculates required values on the client end. For e.g. to display memory usage etc at the zone level, it will fetch all zones. For each zone it will fetch pods->cluster->host->VMs\r\nFor a very large Cloudstack installation this will have a major impact on the performance. \r\nIdeally, there should be an API which calculates all metrics in the backend and the UI should simply show the values. However, for the time, introduce a global setting called enable.metrics which will be set to false. This will cause the metrics button not to be shown on any of the pages.\r\nIf the Admin changes this to true, then the button will be visible and Metrics functionality will work as usual.\r\n\r\nIn

Now stop and start VR and check its restart priority, should be High.\r\n- Enable cluster HA before VR is created. Now create some VM and verify that VR created must have High restart priority.\r\n\r\nIssue validation steps:\r\n- Create a VMware setup with a cluster having 2 ESXi hosts and Enable HA at cluster level in vCenter.\r\n- Creat a Network offering with DHCP and source NAT\r\n- Create few VMs using network created above and Ensure that router VM is created with restart priority set to High.\r\n- Make the ESXi host (where router VM is running) unreachable.\r\n- Verified that router VM is first migrated to other host and VMs acquire IP via

Network Orchestrator is unaware of the extra NICs info of the peer router as they are not persisted in the cloud database and so peer router MAC addresses info is not at all considered in case of RVR when assigning MAC addresses for extra public NICs.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWhen RVR is enabled and Peer Router is available, get the MAC addresses of the extra public NICs from the Peer Router and set them to the router.","created_at":"2016-12-29T12:02:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T09:04:21Z","closed_at":"2017-08-21T09:04:21Z","merged_at":"2017-08-21T09:04:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"0c6cf69eeec940345a6ee01b7d03a184e3c31398","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073391,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:virtual-router","name":"component:virtual-router","color":"ffaaeb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1878/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1878/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1878/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/71d692490cdf613c679573f70ad6199e870547a1","head":{"label":null,"ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9717","sha":"71d692490cdf613c679573f70ad6199e870547a1","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ed376fcad6a107fdb495a2c310fd4d1fe431c4dd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Remove dependency on VmwareContext object to fetch system VM key file\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n========\r\nWhile remote executing commands/scripts through SSH in VR, ACS uses system vm keyfile.\r\nACS is fetching this key file using VMwareContext object which encapsulates vCenter connection handle.\r\nThis is inefficient because of dependency on getServiceContext() which means a vCenter connection\r\nhandle which is not required just to fetch a file in name space in management server.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n===\r\nImplement a method to fetch system vm key file by using Script class instead of VmwareManagerImpl. Ensure this implementation is not present in VmwareManagerImpl itself because fetching the manager object from VmwareContext object unnecessarily adds dependency on session object just to search for keyfile in class path.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Sateesh Chodapuneedi

[VMware] Make hardcoded wait timeout for NIC adapter hotplug as configurable\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n=========\r\nCurrently ACS waits for 15 seconds (hard coded) for hot-plugged NIC in VR running on VMware to get detected by guest OS.\r\nThe time taken to detect hot plugged NIC in guest OS depends on type of VMware NIC adapter like (E1000, VMXNET3, E1000e etc.)\r\nand guest OS itself. In uncommon scenarios the NIC detection may take longer time than 15 seconds,\r\nin such cases NIC hotplug would be treated as failure which results in VPC tier configuration failure.\r\nAlternatively making the wait timeout for NIC adapter hotplug as configurable will be helpful for admins in such scenarios. This is specific to VR running over VMware hypervisor.\r\n\r\nAlso in future if VMware introduces new NIC adapter types which may take time to get detected by guest OS, it is good to have flexibility of\r\nconfiguring the wait timeout as fallback mechanism in such scenarios.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n===\r\nIntroduce new configuration parameter (via ConfigKey) \"vmware.nic.hotplug.wait.timeout\" which is \"Wait timeout (milli seconds) for hot plugged NIC of VM to be detected by guest OS.\" as fallback instead of hard coded timeout, to ensure flexibility for admins given the listed scenarios above.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Sateesh Chodapuneedi

to limit the Public IPs in VPC.\r\nIn VPC network, while acquiring the IP addresses, in the resource_count table, count for the domain is getting increased. However, when the resource count is updated at Domain level, resource count is getting reverted to only non-vpc ip count.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a VPC\r\n2. Create a VPC tier.\r\n3. Check resource_count table and note the ip address count. (say 1)\r\n4. Keep acquiring the IP addresses, (say 4 IP addresses). Now new ip address count resource_count table is 5.\r\n5. update the resource count at domain level.\r\n6. the resource_count is updated back 1\r\n\r\nRoot Cause: Update resource count command recalculates the resource count. While computing public IP we are not considering the ips allocated to VPC.\r\n\r\nResourceLimitManagerImpl.java -> calculatePublicIpForAccount() -> IPAddressDaoImpl.countAllocatedIPsForAccount()\r\n\r\nCurrently we have below query builder. Which does not consider vpc_id column.\r\n```\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount = createSearchBuilder(Long.class);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.select(null, Func.COUNT, AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAddress());\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and(\"account\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAllocatedToAccountId(), Op.EQ);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and(\"allocated\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAllocatedTime(), Op.NNULL);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and(\"network\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAssociatedWithNetworkId(), Op.NNULL);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.done();\r\n```\r\nit generates below sql query\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(user_ip_address.public_ip_address) FROM user_ip_address WHERE user_ip_address.account_id = 6  AND user_ip_address.allocated IS NOT NULL  AND user_ip_address.network_id IS NOT NULL  AND user_ip_address.removed IS NULL\r\n```\r\nFix:\r\nAdd vpc_id check in query.\r\n```\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount = createSearchBuilder(Long.class);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.select(null, Func.COUNT, AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAddress());\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and(\"account\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAllocatedToAccountId(), Op.EQ);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and(\"allocated\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAllocatedTime(), Op.NNULL);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.and().op(\"network\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getAssociatedWithNetworkId(), Op.NNULL);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.or(\"vpc\", AllocatedIpCountForAccount.entity().getVpcId(), Op.NNULL);\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.cp();\r\n        AllocatedIpCountForAccount.done();\r\n```\r\nSQL:\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(user_ip_address.public_ip_address) FROM user_ip_address WHERE user_ip_address.account_id = 6  AND user_ip_address.allocated IS NOT NULL  AND ( user_ip_address.network_id IS NOT NULL or user_ip_address.vpc_id IS NOT NULL) AND user_ip_address.removed IS NULL\r\n```\r\nTest Result:\r\nInitial resource count\r\n```\r\nmysql> select * from resource_count where type in ('vpc','public_ip')

CentOS7 VM fails with error \"Cannot scale up the vm because of memory constraint violation\"\r\n\r\nWhen creating VM from CentOS 7 template on the XenServer with dynamically scaling enabled, instance starts with base specified memory instead of memory * 4 as static limit.\r\n\r\nAs the result, attempt to scale VM throws error in MS log:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Job failed due to exception Unable to scale vm due to Catch exception com.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException when scaling VM:i-24-3976-VM due to com.cloud.utils.exception.CloudRuntimeException: Cannot scale up the vm because of memory constraint violation: 0 <= memory-static-min(2147483648) <= memory-dynamic-min(8589934592) <= memory-dynamic-max(8589934592) <= memory-static-max(2147483648)\r\n```\r\nREPO STEPS\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n1.     Enable dynamic scaling in Global settings\r\n2.     Register an CentOS 7 tempplate(with tools) and tick dynamic scaling\r\n3.     Deploy VM with this template\r\n4.     Start the VM and try to change service offering\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULT: VM should start with static limit 4x<assigned memory> and scale up when offering is changed\r\nACTUAL RESULT: VM starts with maximum static limit of <assigned memory> and doesn't scale up with error in ms log :\r\nCannot scale up the vm because of memory constraint violation:\r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause: Xensever guest OS memory values are missing for 'CentOS 7'.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add Xensever guest OS memory values for 'CentOS 7'. But this needs patching and restart of management server. In this fix the hardcoded values are moved from Java files to database.\r\n\r\n1. Removed XenServerGuestOsMemoryMap from CitrixHelper.java\r\nThis java file was holding a static in memory map named XenServerGuestOsMemoryMap. This was the source for xenserver dynamic memory values(max and min). These values were moved to guest_os_details table.\r\n\r\n2. DAO layer was modified to access these values.\r\n3. VirtualMachineTo object was modified to populate the dynamic memory values.\r\n4. addGuestOs and UpdateGuestOS api has been modified to update memory values.","created_at":"2016-12-21T17:45:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T05:54:51Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T05:54:51Z","merged_at":"2017-05-16T05:54:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4f3c7174423d76386d45f625ba3a768f4c31ba0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2/labels","id":2457914,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNA==","number":2,"title":"4.10.0.0","description":"4.10.0.0
