experimental note from the Go SDK's PubSubio and make it clear that it only works with Dataflow as currently implemented. If that changes, so too can the documentation.\r\n\r\nFix a behavioral difference with the python implementation, where raw bytes messages weren't wrapped in messages before writing. They are now wrapped. Explicitly panic for other PCollection inputs.\r\n\r\nSince this only works on dataflow as implemented, these changes have been manually tested with a modified wordcap that sends data through a PubSub loop (publishing to the same topic being read from). Each pipeline was then successfully drained.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR uses the new generic registrations to optimize the performance of the load tests WRT reflective invocation. This includes DoFns, Functions, Iterators, and Emitters.\r\n\r\nThis required adding registrations for the synthetic SDF source, the RuntimeMonitor, and any test specific DoFns or functions.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, performance has improved! But not quite to Java levels. That JIT is black magic, though Go might be able to get closer with some effort.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n* Always processes the metrics, and print out the measurement in human readable formats, even if we aren't uploading.\r\n* Allows for a \"mixed mode\" method approach for the generic method invocation wrappers.\r\n  * Previous behavior would cause a break for SDFs and similar, since the methods were unavailable. This allows for a fallback using standard reflective wrappers for the additional low frequency methods.\r\n* Fixes the SideInput load tests: they weren't using the same load as the python tests, nor were they measuring from the correct point (after initializing the side input data).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The limit is applied for nested messages. When messages are nested deeper than the specified limit the unmarshalling will fail. If unspecified, a default limit of 10,000 is applied.</p>\n<p>In addition to the configurable limit for message nesting a non-configurable recursion limit for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#groups\">group</a> nesting of 10,000 was introduced.</p>\n<h2>Upcoming breakage changes <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>\n<p>The default recursion limit of 10,000 introduced in the release is subject to change. We want to align this limit with implementations for other languages in the long term. C++ and Java use a limit of 100 which is also the target for the Go implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/32051b4f86e54c2142c7c05362c6e96ae3454a1c\"><code>32051b4</code></a> all: release v1.28.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/3992ea83a23c00882339f33511074d251e19822c\"><code>3992ea8</code></a> all: implement depth limit for unmarshaling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/e5db2960ed1380681b571cdf4648230beefaf58b\"><code>e5db296</code></a> all: update supported versions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/3a9e1dc314e2cb57d6cb054df513f17586295fc7\"><code>3a9e1dc</code></a> all: gofmt all</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/26e8bcb3c743193558d1a0ff540c9e05f999267d\"><code>26e8bcb</code></a> all: remove unnecessary string([]byte) conversion in fmt.Sprintf with %s</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/5aec41b4809b9822a34e17acd06ae9ae9f41c13d\"><code>5aec41b</code></a> testing/protocmp: add Message.Unwrap</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/05be61fde35dcaa3502f4430edee444a294d41c3\"><code>05be61f</code></a> reflect/protoreflect: add more docs on Value aliasing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/commit/b03064a95cacfede187231741d9918a75653057d\"><code>b03064a</code></a> all: start v1.27.1-devel</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go/compare/v1.27.1...v1.28.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=google.golang.org/protobuf&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.27.1&new-version=1.28.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases\">github.com/spf13/cobra's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.4.0</h2>\n<h1>Winter 2022 Release ❄️</h1>\n<p>Another season, another release!</p>\n<h2>Goodbye viper! 🐍 🚀</h2>\n<p>The core Cobra library no longer requires Viper and all of its indirect dependencies. This means that Cobra's dependency tree has been drastically thinned! The Viper dependency was included because of the <code>cobra</code> CLI generation tool. <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0\">This tool has migrated to <code>spf13/cobra-cli</code></a>.</p>\n<p>It's <em>pretty unlikely</em> you were importing and using <strong>the bootstrapping CLI tool</strong> as part of your application (after all, it's just a tool to get going with core <code>cobra</code>).</p>\n<p>But if you were, replace occurrences of</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>with</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;github.com/spf13/cobra-cli&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in your <code>go.mod</code>, you'll want to also include this dependency:</p>\n<pre><code>github.com/spf13/cobra-cli v1.3.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, the maintainers <em>do not anticipate</em> this being a breaking change to users of the core <code>cobra</code> library, so minimal work should be required for users to integrate with this new release. Moreover, this means the dependency tree for your application using Cobra should no longer require dependencies that were inherited from Viper. Huzzah! 🥳</p>\n<p>If you'd like to read more</p>\n<ul>\n<li>issue: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1597\">spf13/cobra#1597</a></li>\n<li>PR: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1604\">spf13/cobra#1604</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation 📝</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Go Doc link and badge in README: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1593\">spf13/cobra#1593</a></li>\n<li>Fix to install command, now targets <code>@latest</code>: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1576\">spf13/cobra#1576</a></li>\n<li>Added MAINTAINERS file: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1545\">spf13/cobra#1545</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other 💭</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bumped license year to 2022 in golden files: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1575\">spf13/cobra#1575</a></li>\n<li>Added Pixie to projects: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1581\">spf13/cobra#1581</a></li>\n<li>Updated labeler for new labeling scheme: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1613\">spf13/cobra#1613</a> &amp; syntax fix: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1624\">spf13/cobra#1624</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shoutout to our awesome contributors helping to make this cobra release possible!!\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spf13\"><code>@​spf13</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/johnSchnake\"><code>@​johnSchnake</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/jpmcb\"><code>@​jpmcb</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/liggitt\"><code>@​liggitt</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/umarcor\"><code>@​umarcor</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/hiljusti\"><code>@​hiljusti</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/marians\"><code>@​marians</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/shyim\"><code>@​shyim</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/htroisi\"><code>@​htroisi</code></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/v1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md\">github.com/spf13/cobra's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Cobra Changelog</h1>\n<h2>v1.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> release-branch.cobra1.1 only: Revert &quot;Deprecate Go &lt; 1.14&quot; to maintain backward compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.1.2</h2>\n<h3>Notable Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump license year to 2021 in golden files (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1309\">#1309</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/Bowbaq\"><code>@​Bowbaq</code></a></li>\n<li>Enhance PowerShell completion with custom comp (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1208\">#1208</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/Luap99\"><code>@​Luap99</code></a></li>\n<li>Update gopkg.in/yaml.v2 to v2.4.0: The previous breaking change in yaml.v2 v2.3.0 has been reverted, see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/go-yaml/yaml/issues/670\">go-yaml/yaml#670</a></li>\n<li>Documentation readability improvements (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1228\">#1228</a> etc.) <a href=\"https://github.com/zaataylor\"><code>@​zaataylor</code></a> etc.</li>\n<li>Use golangci-lint: Repair warnings and errors resulting from linting (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1044\">#1044</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/umarcor\"><code>@​umarcor</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> yaml.v2 2.3.0 contained a unintended breaking change.

generated files.</li>\n<li>Reorder/reference enum classes to avoid forward references.</li>\n<li>Support <code>*_FIELD_NUMBER</code> for extensions</li>\n<li>Bump types-protobuf dependency to 3.19</li>\n<li>Require protobuf 3.19.3</li>\n<li>Support DESCRIPTOR: ServiceDescriptor in py generic services</li>\n<li>More accurately represent method names in py generic services (done -&gt; callback, self -&gt; inst)</li>\n<li>More accurately represent method names in grpc services (<code>request</code> -&gt; <code>request_iterator</code>)</li>\n<li>Internal: Get tests to pass on pure-python protobuf impl (minor semantic differences)</li>\n<li>Internal: Bump pyright in testing to 1.1.206</li>\n<li>Internal: Use stubtest to validate generated stubs match generated runtime</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Require protobuf 3.19.1</li>\n<li>Change <code>EnumTypeWrapper.V</code> to <code>EnumTypeWrapper.ValueType</code> per <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/8182\">protocolbuffers/protobuf#8182</a>.\nWill allow for unquoted annotations starting with protobuf 3.20.0. <code>.V</code> will continue to work for the foreseeable\nfuture for backward compatibility.</li>\n<li>suppress pyright warning reportSelfClsParameterName when a proto field is named <code>self</code></li>\n<li>Allow optional constructor keywords for primitive field types in proto3, following this <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/docs/field_presence.md#presence-in-proto3-apis\">chart</a>.</li>\n<li>Reorder Enum helper classes to eliminate pycharm

in README</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.10</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch from setup.py to pyproject.toml and setup.cfg per <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/\">https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/</a></li>\n<li>Remove dependency on grpcio-tools. mypy-protobuf doesn't need it to run. It's only needed to run mypy afterward.</li>\n<li>Avoid relative imports in <code>_grpc_pb2.pyi</code> stubs. grpc stubs themselves don't use relative imports, nor <code>__init__.py</code> files</li>\n<li>Use <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> docstring style comments in generated code rather than <code>#</code> style so it shows up in IDEs.</li>\n<li>Disambiguate messages from reserved python keywords (eg <code>None</code>) with prefix <code>_r_</code> rather than <code>__</code> - since <code>__</code> is considered private.</li>\n<li>Bump tests to use pyright 1.1.169, types-protobuf 3.17.4, pytest 6.2.5, grpc-stubs 1.24.7, grpcio-tools 1.40.0</li>\n<li>Since upstream protobuf has dropped support with 3.18.0, 2.10 will be the last mypy-protobuf that supports targeting python 2.7.
