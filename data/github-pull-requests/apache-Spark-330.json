What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces a simple hint infrastructure to SQL and implements broadcast join hint using the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe hint syntax looks like the following:\r\n```\r\nSELECT /*+ BROADCAST(t) */ * FROM t\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor broadcast hint, we accept \"BROADCAST\", \"BROADCASTJOIN\", and \"MAPJOIN\", and a sequence of relation aliases can be specified in the hint. A broadcast hint plan node will be inserted on top of any relation (that is not aliased differently), subquery, or common table expression that match the specified name.\r\n\r\nThe hint resolution works by recursively traversing down the query plan to find a relation or subquery that matches one of the specified broadcast aliases. The traversal does not go past beyond any existing broadcast hints, subquery aliases. This rule happens before common table expressions.\r\n\r\nNote that there was an earlier patch in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14426. This is a rewrite of that patch, with different semantics and simpler test cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new unit test suite for the broadcast hint rule (SubstituteHintsSuite) and new test cases for parser change (in PlanParserSuite). Also added end-to-end test case in BroadcastSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-14T12:21:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T14:36:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T22:13:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d08548be5974c287e2b51f176263bea84f8c060","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d429782b38cf19c0d4d6a5102102e39d872fee7","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-16475-broadcast-hint","ref":"SPARK-16475-broadcast-hint","sha":"0d429782b38cf19c0d4d6a5102102e39d872fee7","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecause yarn#client will reset the `spark.yarn.keytab` configuration to point to the location in distributed file, so if user still uses the old `SparkConf` to create `SparkSession` with Hive enabled, it will read keytab from the path in distributed cached. This is OK for yarn cluster mode, but in yarn client mode where driver is running out of container, it will be failed to fetch the keytab.\r\n\r\nSo here we should avoid reseting this configuration in the `yarn#client` and only overwriting it for AM, so using `spark.yarn.keytab` could get correct keytab path no matter running in client (keytab in local fs) or cluster (keytab in distributed cache) mode. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVerified in security cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-14T09:12:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T17:34:36Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T17:34:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dbc5bc3551945c0e0fc31d102aeaf5410915242b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c8390e68f4bc87df014f49ff1040b39138928ee1","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-19038","ref":"SPARK-19038","sha":"c8390e68f4bc87df014f49ff1040b39138928ee1","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19501), this patch addresses the problem where too many HDFS RPCs are made when there are many URIs specified in `spark.yarn.jars`, potentially adding hundreds of RTTs to YARN before the application launches. This becomes significant when submitting the application to a non-local YARN cluster (where the RTT may be in order of 100ms, for example). For each URI specified, the current implementation makes at least two HDFS RPCs, for:\r\n\r\n- [Calling `getFileStatus()` before uploading each file to the distributed cache in `ClientDistributedCacheManager.addResource()`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.1.0/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/ClientDistributedCacheManager.scala#L71).\r\n- [Resolving any symbolic links in each of the file URI](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.1.0/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/Client.scala#L377-L379), which repeatedly makes HDFS RPCs until the all symlinks are resolved. (see [`FileContext.resolve(Path)`](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileContext.java#L2189-L2195), [`FSLinkResolver.resolve(FileContext, Path)`](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FSLinkResolver.java#L79-L112), and [`AbstractFileSystem.resolvePath()`](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/AbstractFileSystem.java#L464-L468).)\r\n\r\nThe first `getFileStatus` RPC can be removed, using `statCache` populated with the file statuses retrieved with [the previous `globStatus` call](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.1.0/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/Client.scala#L531).\r\n\r\nThe second one can be largely reduced by caching the symlink resolution results in a mutable.HashMap. This patch adds a local variable in `yarn.Client.prepareLocalResources()` and passes it as an additional parameter to `yarn.Client.copyFileToRemote`.  [The symlink resolution code was added in 2013](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a35472e1dd2ea1b5a0b1fb6b382f5a98f5aeba5a#diff-b050df3f55b82065803d6e83453b9706R187) and has not changed since. I am assuming that this is still required, but otherwise we can remove using `symlinkCache` and symlink resolution altogether.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch is based off 8e8afb3, currently the latest YARN patch on master. All tests except a few in spark-hive passed with `./dev/run-tests` on my machine, using JDK 1.8.0_112 on macOS 10.12.3; also tested myself with this modified version of SPARK 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT which performed a normal deployment and execution on a YARN cluster without errors.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-13T19:40:09Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T20:05:01Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T19:36:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b73ce2b988d4834bea6a2232cfdc22f31fc6a464","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/523c58c35fc9f046c601e99a0389d7ca7c3e508f","head":{"label":"jongwook:SPARK-19501","ref":"SPARK-19501","sha":"523c58c35fc9f046c601e99a0389d7ca7c3e508f","user":{"login":"jongwook","id":266841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njg0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook","html_url":"https://github.com/jongwook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38499098,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODQ5OTA5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jongwook/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jongwook","id":266841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njg0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook","html_url":"https://github.com/jongwook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jongwook/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that having a lot of memory on a server JVM tries to allocate a huge chunk of it for the heap by default when it starts.\r\n\r\nI'm using the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable to override default JVM settings and set an adequate system-wide heap size. When command line options merge with JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS I'm getting the following error because my initial heap size (1g for instance) exceeds the maximum heap size (128m) provided in the code:\r\n```\r\nError occurred during initialization of VM\r\nIncompatible minimum and maximum heap sizes specified\r\n```\r\nI debugged the launcher scripts, and it seems there is no visible way to fix this issue outside the code. Therefore, my proposal is to provide an initial heap size in the code too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.","created_at":"2017-02-13T13:04:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T20:13:21Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T20:12:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66caaa5ff182d62a3ba6f99b36f0af88b4bf7ac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be6deabcf30b2ceda475e31d45626e211af7d195","head":{"label":"Pashugan:fix_java_options_conflict","ref":"fix_java_options_conflict","sha":"be6deabcf30b2ceda475e31d45626e211af7d195","user":{"login":"Pashugan","id":3354249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTQyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3354249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan","html_url":"https://github.com/Pashugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81797471,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTc5NzQ3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Pashugan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Pashugan","id":3354249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTQyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3354249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan","html_url":"https://github.com/Pashugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pashugan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Pashugan/spark","description":"Mirror

in `saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` always committed its tasks without question. The problem is that when speculation is enabled sometimes this can result in multiple tasks committing their output to the same path, which may lead to task temporary paths exist in output path after `saveAsNewAPIHadoopFile` completes. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group       0   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/_SUCCESS\r\ndrwxr-xr-x    -   user group       0   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/attempt_201702111936_32487_r_000044_0\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group    8952   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/part-r-00000\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group    7878   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/part-r-00001\r\n```\r\nAssume there are two attempt tasks that commit at the same time, The two attempt tasks maybe rename their task attempt paths to task committed path at the same time. When one task's `rename` operation completes, the other task's `rename` operation will let its task attempt path under the task committed path.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is not recommended that `writeShard` in `saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` always committed its tasks without question. Similar question in SPARK-4879 triggered by calling saveAsHadoopFile has been solved. Newest master has solved it too. This PR just fix

in `saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` always committed its tasks without question. The problem is that when speculation is enabled sometimes this can result in multiple tasks committing their output to the same path, which may lead to task temporary paths exist in output path after `saveAsNewAPIHadoopFile` completes. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group       0   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/_SUCCESS\r\ndrwxr-xr-x    -   user group       0   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/attempt_201702111936_32487_r_000044_0\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group    8952   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/part-r-00000\r\n-rw-r--r--    3   user group    7878   2017-02-11 19:36 hdfs://.../output/part-r-00001\r\n```\r\nAssume there are two attempt tasks that commit at the same time, The two attempt tasks maybe rename their task attempt paths to task committed path at the same time. When one task's `rename` operation completes, the other task's `rename` operation will let its task attempt path under the task committed path.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is not recommended that `writeShard` in `saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset` always committed its tasks without question. Similar question in SPARK-4879 triggered by calling saveAsHadoopFile has been solved. Newest master has solved it too.

In case of skew, this causes OOMs (see comments in SPARK-13450 for more details). Heap dump from a failed job confirms this : https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12846382/heap-dump-analysis.png . While its possible to increase the heap size to workaround, Spark should be resilient to such issues as skews can happen arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n## Change proposed in this pull request\r\n\r\n- Introduces `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` \r\n  - It holds `UnsafeRow`s in-memory upto a certain threshold. \r\n  - After the threshold is hit, it switches to `UnsafeExternalSorter` which enables spilling of the rows to disk. It does NOT sort the data.\r\n  - Allows iterating the array multiple times. However, any alteration to the array (using `add` or `clear`) will invalidate the existing iterator(s)\r\n- `WindowExec` was already using `UnsafeExternalSorter` to support spilling. Changed it to use the new array\r\n- Changed `SortMergeJoinExec` to use the new array implementation\r\n  - NOTE: I have not changed FULL OUTER JOIN to use this new array implementation. Changing that will need more surgery and I will rather put up a separate PR for that once this gets in.\r\n- Changed `CartesianProductExec` to use the new array implementation\r\n\r\n#### Note for reviewers\r\n\r\nThe diff can be divided into 3 parts. My motive behind having all the changes in a single PR was to demonstrate that the API is sane and supports 2 use cases. If reviewing as 3 separate PRs would help, I am happy to make the split.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested ?\r\n\r\n#### Unit testing\r\n- Added unit tests `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` to validate all its APIs and access patterns\r\n- Added unit test for `SortMergeExec`\r\n  - with and without spill for inner join, left outer join, right outer join to confirm that the spill threshold config behaves as expected and output is as expected.\r\n  - This PR touches the scanning logic in `SortMergeExec` for _all_ joins (except FULL OUTER JOIN). However, I expect existing test cases to cover that there is no regression in correctness.\r\n- Added unit test for `WindowExec` to check behavior of spilling and correctness of results.\r\n\r\n#### Stress testing\r\n- Confirmed that OOM is gone by running against a production job which used to OOM\r\n- Since I cannot share details about prod workload externally, created synthetic data to mimic the issue. Ran before and after the fix to demonstrate the issue and query success with this PR\r\n\r\nGenerating the synthetic data\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --driver-memory=6G\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nval hc = SparkSession.builder.master(\"local\").getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spark_13450_large_table\").collect\r\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spark_13450_one_row_table\").collect\r\n\r\nval df1 = (0 until 1).map(i => (\"10\", \"100\", i.toString, (i * 2).toString)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\", \"str1\", \"str2\")\r\ndf1.write.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc.OrcFileFormat\").bucketBy(100, \"i\", \"j\").sortBy(\"i\", \"j\").saveAsTable(\"spark_13450_one_row_table\")\r\n\r\nval df2 = (0 until 3000000).map(i => (\"10\", \"100\", i.toString, (i * 2).toString)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\", \"str1\", \"str2\")\r\ndf2.write.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc.OrcFileFormat\").bucketBy(100, \"i\", \"j\").sortBy(\"i\", \"j\").saveAsTable(\"spark_13450_large_table\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nRan this against trunk VS local build with this PR.

Note that this dataset does not have skew so no spill happened. I saw improvement in CPU time by 2-4% over version without this PR. This did not add up as I was expected some regression. I think allocating array of capacity of 128 at the start (instead of starting with default size 16) is the sole reason for the perf. gain : https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark/blob/SPARK-13450_smb_buffer_oom/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray.scala#L43 . I could remove that and rerun, but effectively the change will be deployed in this form and I wanted to see the effect of it over large workload.\r\n\r\n### Micro-benchmark\r\n\r\nTwo types of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-15236 do this for scala shell, this ticket is for sparkR shell. This is not only for sparkR itself, but can also benefit downstream project like livy which use shell.R for its interactive session. For now, livy has no control of whether enable hive or not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested it manually, run `bin/sparkR --master local --conf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-15236 do this for scala shell, this ticket is for pyspark shell. This is not only for pyspark itself, but can also benefit downstream project like livy which use shell.py for its interactive session. For now, livy has no control of whether enable hive or not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI didn't find a way to add test for it. Just manually test it. \r\nRun `bin/pyspark --master local --conf spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory` and verify hive is not enabled.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome `Schedulable` Entities(`Pool` and `TaskSetManager`) variables need refactoring for _immutability_ and _access modifiers_ levels as follows:\r\n- From `var` to `val` (if there is no requirement): This is important to support immutability as much as possible.\r\n  - Sample => `Pool`: `weight`, `minShare`, `priority`, `name` and `taskSetSchedulingAlgorithm`.\r\n- Access modifiers: Specially, `var`s access needs to be restricted from other parts of codebase to prevent potential side effects.\r\n  - `TaskSetManager`: `tasksSuccessful`, `totalResultSize`, `calculatedTasks` etc...\r\n\r\nThis PR is related with #15604 and has been created seperatedly to keep patch content as isolated and to help the reviewers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs and existing UT coverage.","created_at":"2017-02-12T22:20:48Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T10:59:10Z","closed_at":"2017-03-24T00:23:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"456b436654a03e712258c3718a1e7cc63c23a08b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16905/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16905/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16905/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/479c01d43de71d03b3276cdd59f12083e7da31c9","head":{"label":"erenavsarogullari:SPARK-19567","ref":"SPARK-19567","sha":"479c01d43de71d03b3276cdd59f12083e7da31c9","user":{"login":"erenavsarogullari","id":1437738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari","html_url":"https://github.com/erenavsarogullari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"046b8d4aef00b0701cf7e4b99aeaf450cacb42fe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

In our current implementation, the first consumer and the second consumer would be in the same group (which leads to SPARK-19559), **_violating our intention of the two consumers not being in the same group._**\r\n\r\nThe cause is that, in our current implementation, the first consumer is created before `groupId` and `nextId` are initialized in the constructor. Then even if `groupId` and `nextId` are increased during the creation of that first consumer, `groupId` and `nextId` would still be initialized to default values in the constructor for the second consumer.\r\n\r\nWe should make sure that `groupId` and `nextId` are initialized before any consumer is created.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan 100 times of `KafkaSourceSuite`; all passed\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-12T14:48:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T17:51:20Z","closed_at":"2017-02-13T07:02:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19e359f527e1a46b6731e5fab6349f61707026c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cda7b8f46317ca0155e3bdc0cf9e8f81451d6191","head":{"label":"lw-lin:SPARK-19564-","ref":"SPARK-19564-","sha":"cda7b8f46317ca0155e3bdc0cf9e8f81451d6191","user":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49997538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTk5NzUzOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"lw-lin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `KafkaOffsetReader`, when error occurs, we abort the existing consumer and create a new consumer. In our current implementation, the first consumer and the second consumer would be in the same group, which violates our intention of the two consumers not being in the same group.\r\n\r\nThe cause is that, in our current implementation, the first consumer is created before `groupId` and `nextId` are initialized in the constructor. Then even if `groupId` and `nextId` are increased during the creation of that first consumer, `groupId` and `nextId` would still be initialized to default values in the constructor.\r\n\r\nWe should make sure that `groupId` and `nextId` are initialized before any consumer is created.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan 100 times of `KafkaSourceSuite`; all passed\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-12T11:46:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-12T16:06:36Z","closed_at":"2017-02-12T14:47:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4b72f8f86190046066ddb798670b409b98f0e0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f19af3b6b2fdc8f527f952bbf65681755c3f6b4","head":{"label":"lw-lin:SPARK-19564","ref":"SPARK-19564","sha":"0f19af3b6b2fdc8f527f952bbf65681755c3f6b4","user":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49997538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTk5NzUzOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"lw-lin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `FileFormatWriter`, we will sort the input rows by partition columns and bucket id and sort columns, if we want to write data out partitioned or bucketed.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the data is already sorted, we will sort it again, which is unnecssary.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the sorting logic in `FileFormatWriter` and use `SortExec` instead. We will not add `SortExec` if the data is already sorted.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI did a micro benchmark manually\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(10000000).select($\"id\", $\"id\" % 10 as \"part\").sort(\"part\")\r\nspark.time(df.write.partitionBy(\"part\").parquet(\"/tmp/test\"))\r\n```\r\nThe result was about 6.4 seconds before this PR, and is 5.7 seconds afterwards.\r\n\r\nclose

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-15615 proposes replacing the sqlContext.read.json(rdd) with a dataset equivalent.\r\nSPARK-15463 adds a CSV API for reading from Dataset[String] so this keeps the API consistent.\r\nI am deprecating the existing RDD based APIs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are existing tests. I left most tests to use the existing APIs as they delegate to the new json API.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16067 to Spark 2.0\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe `constraints` of an operator is the expressions that evaluate to `true` for all the rows produced. That means, the expression result should be neither `false` nor `unknown` (NULL). Thus, we can conclude that `IsNotNull` on all the constraints, which are generated by its own predicates or propagated from the children. The constraint can be a complex expression. For better usage of these constraints, we try to push down `IsNotNull` to the lowest-level expressions (i.e., `Attribute`). `IsNotNull` can be pushed through an expression when it is null intolerant. (When the input is NULL, the null-intolerant expression always evaluates to NULL.)\r\n\r\nBelow is the existing code we have for `IsNotNull` pushdown.\r\n```Scala\r\n  private def scanNullIntolerantExpr(expr: Expression): Seq[Attribute] = expr match {\r\n    case a: Attribute => Seq(a)\r\n    case _: NullIntolerant | IsNotNull(_: NullIntolerant) =>\r\n      expr.children.flatMap(scanNullIntolerantExpr)\r\n    case _ => Seq.empty[Attribute]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`IsNotNull` itself is not null-intolerant.** It converts `null` to `false`. If the expression does not include any `Not`-like expression, it works; otherwise, it could generate a wrong result. This PR is to fix the above function by removing the `IsNotNull` from the inference. After the fix, when a constraint has a `IsNotNull` expression, we infer new attribute-specific `IsNotNull` constraints if and only if `IsNotNull` appears in the root. \r\n\r\nWithout the fix, the following test case will return empty.\r\n```Scala\r\nval data = Seq[java.lang.Integer](1, null).toDF(\"key\")\r\ndata.filter(\"not key is not null\").show()\r\n```\r\nBefore the fix, the optimized plan is like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [value#1 AS key#3]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(value#1) && NOT isnotnull(value#1))\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, the optimized plan is like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [value#1 AS key#3]\r\n+- Filter NOT isnotnull(value#1)\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a

Instead, I think method should be rewritten in an imperative style using a Java string builder.\r\n\r\nThis method can become a performance bottleneck in cases where regex expressions are used with non-constant-foldable expressions (e.g. the regex expression comes from the data rather than being part of the query).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n## Performance

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe reason for test failure is that the property “oracle.jdbc.mapDateToTimestamp” set by the test was getting converted into all lower case. Oracle database expects this property in case-sensitive manner.\r\n\r\nThis test was passing in previous releases because connection properties were sent as user specified for the test case scenario. Fixes to handle all option uniformly in case-insensitive manner, converted the JDBC connection properties also to lower case.\r\n\r\nThis PR  enhances CaseInsensitiveMap to keep track of input case-sensitive keys , and uses those when creating connection properties that are passed to the JDBC connection. \r\n\r\nAlternative approach PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16847  is to pass original input keys to JDBC data source by adding check in the  Data source class and handle case-insensitivity in the JDBC source code.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test cases to JdbcSuite , and OracleIntegrationSuite. Ran docker integration tests passed on my laptop, all tests passed successfully.","created_at":"2017-02-11T04:37:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T23:50:39Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T23:36:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9910ffe48de01e9502fae3c54774bd327d19c205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27338c9451f78d89cade769759cf6c597f959b1a","head":{"label":"sureshthalamati:jdbc_case_senstivity_props_fix-SPARK-19318","ref":"jdbc_case_senstivity_props_fix-SPARK-19318","sha":"27338c9451f78d89cade769759cf6c597f959b1a","user":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40833027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDgzMzAyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sureshthalamati/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati/spark","description":"Mirror

me:\r\n* i do not use codegen for the encoder expressions. instead i rely on fromRow and toRow in ExpressionEncoder. that seems inefficient.\r\n* some unnecessary wrapping in InternalRows. this is probably related to the usage of fromRow and toRow\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for Hive UDFs that return fully typed java Lists or Maps, for example `List<String>` or `Map<String, Integer>`.  It is also allowed to nest these structures, for example `Map<String, List<Integer>>`. Raw collections or collections using wildcards are still not supported, and cannot be supported due to the lack of type information.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing tests in `HiveUDFSuite`, and I have added test cases for raw collection and collection using wildcards.","created_at":"2017-02-10T11:26:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-10T22:49:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T22:49:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"693ad75b2d12b436174b4c2a9c89391bdfbf39da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8cf25b9a19c0aa8dec49fea5c1061b3250b516c1","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-19548","ref":"SPARK-19548","sha":"8cf25b9a19c0aa8dec49fea5c1061b3250b516c1","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is an enhancement to ML StringIndexer. \r\nBefore this PR, String Indexer only supports \"skip\"/\"error\" options to deal with unseen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the error message when some data types are compatible and others are not in set/union operation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the code below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nSeq((1,(\"a\", 1))).toDF.union(Seq((1L,(\"a\", \"b\"))).toDF)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthrows an exception saying `LongType` and `IntegerType` are incompatible types. It should say something about `StructType`s with more readable format as below:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnion can only be performed on tables with the compatible column types.\r\nLongType <> IntegerType at the first column of the second table;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnion can only be performed on tables with the compatible column types.\r\nstruct<_1:string,_2:string> <> struct<_1:string,_2:int> at the second column of the second table;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n*I manually inserted a newline in the messages above for readability only in this PR description.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `AnalysisErrorSuite`, manual tests and build wth Scala 2.10.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-10T05:05:25Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:48Z","closed_at":"2017-02-13T15:11:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26533135b7a6c3b08e0a4b74f43d6d9b22c7b0ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ef5c07dc4bc7b4ba28f3fa2dcc13ad731b2e779","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19544","ref":"SPARK-19544","sha":"4ef5c07dc4bc7b4ba28f3fa2dcc13ad731b2e779","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Issue:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19541\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, We use the spark ThriftServer frequently, and there are many connects between the client and only ThriftServer.When the ThriftServer is down ,we cannot get the service again.So we need to consider the ThriftServer HA as well as master HA. \r\nFor ThriftServer, we want to import the pattern of HiveServer HA to provide ThriftServer HA. Therefore, we need to start multiple thrift server which register on the zookeeper. Then the client  can find the thrift server by just connecting to the zookeeper.So the beeline can get the service from other thrift server when one is down.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... ` is deprecated and recommend users to use `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW ...` And it does not support `IF NOT EXISTS `clause. However, if there is an existing temporary view defined, it is possible to unintentionally replace this existing view by issuing `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...`  with the same table/view name.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to disallow `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...` with an existing view name. \r\nUnder the cover, `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...` will be changed to create temporary view, however, passing in a flag `replace=false`, instead of currently `true`. So when creating temporary view under the cover, if there is existing view with the same name, the operation will be blocked. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test case is added and updated some existing test cases to adapt the new behavior","created_at":"2017-02-10T01:29:30Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T03:48:16Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T03:48:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"949c87a190881dd6acdfc6ab9d9ce2a75dc1f23c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16878/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16878/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16878/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a989cf8f5b116656589fe3d972aba116e3cfcc5","head":{"label":"xwu0226:block_duplicate_temp_table","ref":"block_duplicate_temp_table","sha":"3a989cf8f5b116656589fe3d972aba116e3cfcc5","user":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42968936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk2ODkzNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"xwu0226/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226/spark","description":"Mirror

This is not intended to be merged! (see note at bottom) Posting to facilitate discussion around #16620. ****\r\n\r\nThe pendingPartitions in Stage tracks partitions that still need to be computed, and is used by the DAGScheduler to determine when to mark the stage as complete. In most cases, this variable is exactly consistent with the tasks in the TaskSetManager (for the current version of the stage) that are still pending. However, as discussed in SPARK-19263, these can become inconsistent when an ShuffleMapTask for an earlier attempt of the stage completes, in which case the DAGScheduler may think the stage has finished, while the TaskSetManager is still waiting for some tasks to complete (see the description in this pull request: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16620). This leads to bugs like SPARK-19263. Another problem with this behavior is that listeners can get two StageCompleted messages: once when the DAGScheduler thinks the stage is complete, and a second when the TaskSetManager later decides the stage is complete. We should fix this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, merging this would lead to a performance regression, as discussed in #16620.  Currently, the DAGScheduler may mark a Stage as completed \"early\", before the TSM thinks it's done, based on task completions from earlier attempts of the stage, and with this commit, that can't happen.","created_at":"2017-02-09T23:55:44Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T06:27:08Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T06:27:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0141d378a33862da1724a9ac092edfbcad504018","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b575e933dc6f774f8e9ca5dc23ef5f412181ab0e","head":{"label":"kayousterhout:SPARK-19538","ref":"SPARK-19538","sha":"b575e933dc6f774f8e9ca5dc23ef5f412181ab0e","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17229881,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyOTg4MQ==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"kayousterhout/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf a column of a table is all null values, the follow SQL will throw an NPE: `select count(1) from test group by e grouping sets(e)`.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that when transformUp a `GroupingSets` in `ResolveGroupingAnalytics` it uses a `nullBitmask` to set an attribute with null ability, the nullable attribute may be modified.\r\n\r\nThis pr just set all attribute's null ability to `true` in group by  expressions to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThe pr #15484 in master branch has fixed this problem. \r\n\r\nWe also need to fix this problem in branch-2.1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest with Hive in my

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe analyzer currently does not check if a column used in grouping sets is actually nullable itself. This can cause the nullability of the column to be incorrect, which can cause null pointer exceptions down the line. This PR fixes that by also consider the nullability of the column.\r\n\r\nThis is only a problem for Spark 2.1 and below. The latest master uses a different approach.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16874\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously range operator could not be interrupted. For example, using DAGScheduler.cancelStage(...) on a query with range might have been ineffective.\r\n\r\nThis change adds periodic checks of TaskContext.isInterrupted to codegen version, and InterruptibleOperator to non-codegen version.\r\n\r\nI benchmarked the performance of codegen version on a sample query `spark.range(1000L * 1000 * 1000 * 10).count()` and there is no measurable difference.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdds a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the new approach of view resolution, we can get rid of SQL generation on view creation, so let's remove SQL builder for operators.\r\n\r\nNote that, since all sql generation for operators is defined in one file (org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.SQLBuilder), it’d be trivial to recover it in the future.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-02-09T09:42:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T07:18:58Z","closed_at":"2017-02-09T18:38:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2f0f8e33216b1ea25f226490599655cdb882425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52b4a5e945cb81a28da15288c21926261f1b7e12","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:SQLBuilder","ref":"SQLBuilder","sha":"52b4a5e945cb81a28da15288c21926261f1b7e12","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch replaces a single `awaitUninterruptibly()` call with a plain `await()` call in Spark's `network-common` library in order to fix a bug which may cause tasks to be uncancellable.\r\n\r\nIn Spark's Netty RPC layer, `TransportClientFactory.createClient()` calls `awaitUninterruptibly()` on a Netty future while waiting for a connection to be established. This creates problem when a Spark task is interrupted while blocking in this call (which can happen in the event of a slow connection which will eventually time out). This has bad impacts on task cancellation when `interruptOnCancel = true`.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the impact of this problem, I experienced significant numbers of uncancellable \"zombie tasks\" on a production cluster where several tasks were blocked trying to connect to a dead shuffle server and then continued running as zombies after I cancelled the associated Spark stage. The zombie tasks ran for several minutes with the following stack:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\r\njava.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:460)\r\nio.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.await0(DefaultPromise.java:607) \r\nio.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.awaitUninterruptibly(DefaultPromise.java:301) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory.createClient(TransportClientFactory.java:224) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory.createClient(TransportClientFactory.java:179) => holding Monitor(java.lang.Object@1849476028}) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleClient$1.createAndStart(ExternalShuffleClient.java:105) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.shuffle.RetryingBlockFetcher.fetchAllOutstanding(RetryingBlockFetcher.java:140) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.shuffle.RetryingBlockFetcher.start(RetryingBlockFetcher.java:120) \r\norg.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleClient.fetchBlocks(ExternalShuffleClient.java:114) \r\norg.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.sendRequest(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:169) \r\norg.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.fetchUpToMaxBytes(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:\r\n350) \r\norg.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.initialize(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:286) \r\norg.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.<init>(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:120) \r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.BlockStoreShuffleReader.read(BlockStoreShuffleReader.scala:45) \r\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.ShuffledRowRDD.compute(ShuffledRowRDD.scala:169) \r\norg.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:323) \r\norg.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:287) \r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, `awaitUninterruptibly()` might have been used in order to avoid having to declare that methods throw `InterruptedException` (this code is written in Java, hence the need to use checked exceptions). This patch simply replaces this with a regular, interruptible `await()` call,.\r\n\r\nThis required several interface changes to declare a new checked exception (these are internal interfaces, though, and this change doesn't significantly impact binary compatibility).\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to wrap `InterruptedException` into `IOException` in order to avoid having to change interfaces. The problem with this approach is that the `network-shuffle` project's `RetryingBlockFetcher` code treats `IOExceptions` as transitive failures when deciding whether to retry fetches, so throwing a wrapped `IOException` might cause an interrupted shuffle fetch to be retried, further prolonging the lifetime of a cancelled zombie task.\r\n\r\nNote that there are three other

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe use guava cache to cache compiled codes for codegen. Currently we use number of entries (100 as maximum now) in the cache to determine when to evict older entries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the number of entries can't reflect well to actual memory usage of cache entries. As we heavily rely codegen now and the generated codes can be large, we shouldn't use maximum of entries.\r\n\r\nThis patch turns to use `Weigher` in guava. We use the size of bytecode as the weight of an entry.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNetty's `MessageToMessageEncoder` uses [Javassist](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/91a0bdc17a8298437d6de08a8958d753799bd4a6/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/internal/JavassistTypeParameterMatcherGenerator.java#L62) to generate a matcher class and the implementation calls `Class.forName` to check if this class is already generated. If `MessageEncoder` or `MessageDecoder` is created in `ExecutorClassLoader.findClass`, it will cause `ClassCircularityError`. This is because loading this Netty generated class will call `ExecutorClassLoader.findClass` to search this class, and `ExecutorClassLoader` will try to use RPC to load it and cause to load the non-exist matcher class again. JVM will report `ClassCircularityError` to prevent such infinite recursion.\r\n\r\n##### Why it only happens in Maven builds \r\n\r\nIt's because Maven and SBT have different class loader tree. The Maven build will set a URLClassLoader as the current context class loader to run the tests and expose this issue. The class loader tree is as following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbootstrap class loader ------ ... ----- REPL class loader ---- ExecutorClassLoader\r\n|\r\n|\r\nURLClasssLoader\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SBT build uses the bootstrap class loader directly and `ReplSuite.test(\"propagation of local properties\")` is the first test in ReplSuite, which happens to load `io/netty/util/internal/__matchers__/org/apache/spark/network/protocol/MessageMatcher` into the bootstrap class loader (Note: in maven build, it's loaded into URLClasssLoader so it cannot be found in ExecutorClassLoader). This issue can be reproduced in SBT as well. Here are the produce steps:\r\n- Enable `hadoop.caller.context.enabled`.\r\n- Replace `Class.forName` with `Utils.classForName` in `object CallerContext`.\r\n- Ignore `ReplSuite.test(\"propagation of local properties\")`.\r\n- Run `ReplSuite` using SBT.\r\n\r\nThis PR just creates a singleton MessageEncoder and MessageDecoder and makes sure they are created before switching to ExecutorClassLoader. TransportContext will be created when creating RpcEnv and that happens before creating ExecutorClassLoader.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-08T20:12:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T20:07:19Z","closed_at":"2017-02-13T20:06:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91a6b74e0317f6601b0b2527007e82cc891e9d3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7fcb31788a24ca48c988b2ea03bb803112f484a8","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-17714","ref":"SPARK-17714","sha":"7fcb31788a24ca48c988b2ea03bb803112f484a8","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fd6c3a0b10ce43a56df845ba66d160b77f02e576","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen function 'executorLost' is invoked in class 'TaskSetManager', it's significant to judge whether variable 'isZombie' is set to true.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the following hang:\r\n\r\n1.Open speculation switch in the application.\r\n2.Run this app and suppose last task of shuffleMapStage 1 finishes. Let's get the record straight, from the eyes of DAG, this stage really finishes, and from the eyes of TaskSetManager, variable 'isZombie' is set to true, but variable runningTasksSet isn't empty because of speculation.\r\n3.Suddenly, executor 3 is lost. TaskScheduler receiving this signal, invokes all executorLost functions of rootPool's taskSetManagers. DAG receiving this signal, removes all this executor's outputLocs.\r\n4.TaskSetManager adds all this executor's tasks to pendingTasks and tells DAG they will be resubmitted (Attention: possibly not on time).\r\n5.DAG starts to submit a new waitingStage, let's say shuffleMapStage 2, and going to find that shuffleMapStage 1 is its missing parent because some outputLocs are removed due to executor lost. Then DAG submits shuffleMapStage 1 again.\r\n6.DAG still receives Task 'Resubmitted' signal from old taskSetManager, and increases the number of pendingTasks of shuffleMapStage 1 each time. However, old taskSetManager won't resolve new task to submit because its variable 'isZombie' is set to true.\r\n7.Finally shuffleMapStage 1 never finishes in DAG together with all stages depending on it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt's quite difficult to construct test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add an API that loads `DataFrame` from `Dataset[String]` storing csv.\r\n\r\nIt allows pre-processing before loading into CSV, which means allowing a lot of workarounds for many narrow cases, for example, as below:\r\n\r\n- Case 1 - pre-processing\r\n\r\n  ```scala\r\n  val df = spark.read.text(\"...\")\r\n  // Pre-processing with this.\r\n  spark.read.csv(df.as[String])\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Case 2 - use other input formats\r\n\r\n  ```scala\r\n  val rdd = spark.sparkContext.newAPIHadoopFile(\"/file.csv.lzo\",\r\n    classOf[com.hadoop.mapreduce.LzoTextInputFormat],\r\n    classOf[org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable],\r\n

is a follow up PR for merging #16758 to spark 2.1 branch\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`mapGroupsWithState` is a new API for arbitrary stateful operations in Structured Streaming, similar to `DStream.mapWithState` \r\n\r\n*Requirements*\r\n- Users should be able to specify a function that can do the following\r\n- Access the input row corresponding to a key\r\n- Access the previous state corresponding to a key\r\n- Optionally, update or remove the state\r\n- Output any number of new rows (or none at all)\r\n\r\n*Proposed API*\r\n```\r\n// ------------ New methods on KeyValueGroupedDataset ------------\r\nclass KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, V] {\t\r\n\t// Scala friendly\r\n\tdef mapGroupsWithState[S: Encoder, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => U)\r\n        def flatMapGroupsWithState[S: Encode, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => Iterator[U])\r\n\t// Java friendly\r\n       def mapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: MapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n       def flatMapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ------------------- New Java-friendly function classes ------------------- \r\npublic interface MapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  R call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\npublic interface FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  Iterator<R> call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ---------------------- Wrapper class for state data ---------------------- \r\ntrait KeyedState[S] {\r\n\tdef exists(): Boolean  \t\r\n  \tdef get(): S \t\t\t// throws Exception is state does not exist\r\n\tdef getOption(): Option[S]       \r\n\tdef update(newState: S): Unit\r\n\tdef remove(): Unit\t\t// exists() will be false after this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey Semantics of the State class\r\n- The state can be null.\r\n- If the state.remove() is called, then state.exists() will return false, and getOption will returm None.\r\n- After that state.update(newState) is called, then state.exists() will return true, and getOption will return Some(...). \r\n- None of the operations are thread-safe. This is to avoid memory barriers.\r\n\r\n*Usage*\r\n```\r\nval stateFunc = (word: String, words: Iterator[String, runningCount: KeyedState[Long]) => {\r\n    val newCount = words.size + runningCount.getOption.getOrElse(0L)\r\n    runningCount.update(newCount)\r\n   (word, newCount)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndataset\t\t\t\t\t                        // type is Dataset[String]\r\n  .groupByKey[String](w => w)        \t                // generates KeyValueGroupedDataset[String, String]\r\n  .mapGroupsWithState[Long, (String, Long)](stateFunc)\t// returns Dataset[(String, Long)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2017-02-08T05:35:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T11:00:57Z","closed_at":"2017-02-09T05:57:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d19e61ac41625fed7f12194df5a11a7b606cd9a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5025cb7511a43e24cb3a181eb7b06c69b024479f","head":{"label":"tdas:mapWithState-branch-2.1","ref":"mapWithState-branch-2.1","sha":"5025cb7511a43e24cb3a181eb7b06c69b024479f","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`mapGroupsWithState` is a new API for arbitrary stateful operations in Structured Streaming, similar to `DStream.mapWithState` \r\n\r\n*Requirements*\r\n- Users should be able to specify a function that can do the following\r\n- Access the input row corresponding to a key\r\n- Access the previous state corresponding to a key\r\n- Optionally, update or remove the state\r\n- Output any number of new rows (or none at all)\r\n\r\n*Proposed API*\r\n```\r\n// ------------ New methods on KeyValueGroupedDataset ------------\r\nclass KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, V] {\t\r\n\t// Scala friendly\r\n\tdef mapGroupsWithState[S: Encoder, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => U)\r\n        def flatMapGroupsWithState[S: Encode, U: Encoder](func: (K, Iterator[V], KeyedState[S]) => Iterator[U])\r\n\t// Java friendly\r\n       def mapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: MapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n       def flatMapGroupsWithState[S, U](func: FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction[K, V, S, R], stateEncoder: Encoder[S], resultEncoder: Encoder[U])\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ------------------- New Java-friendly function classes ------------------- \r\npublic interface MapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  R call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\npublic interface FlatMapGroupsWithStateFunction<K, V, S, R> extends Serializable {\r\n  Iterator<R> call(K key, Iterator<V> values, state: KeyedState<S>) throws Exception;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ---------------------- Wrapper class for state data ---------------------- \r\ntrait KeyedState[S] {\r\n\tdef exists(): Boolean  \t\r\n  \tdef get(): S \t\t\t// throws Exception is state does not exist\r\n\tdef getOption(): Option[S]       \r\n\tdef update(newState: S): Unit\r\n\tdef remove(): Unit\t\t// exists() will be false after this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey Semantics of the State class\r\n- The state can be null.\r\n- If the state.remove() is called, then state.exists() will return false, and getOption will returm None.\r\n- After that state.update(newState) is called, then state.exists() will return true, and getOption will return Some(...). \r\n- None of the operations are thread-safe. This is to avoid memory barriers.\r\n\r\n*Usage*\r\n```\r\nval stateFunc = (word: String, words: Iterator[String, runningCount: KeyedState[Long]) => {\r\n    val newCount = words.size + runningCount.getOption.getOrElse(0L)\r\n    runningCount.update(newCount)\r\n   (word, newCount)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndataset\t\t\t\t\t                        // type is Dataset[String]\r\n  .groupByKey[String](w => w)        \t                // generates KeyValueGroupedDataset[String, String]\r\n  .mapGroupsWithState[Long, (String, Long)](stateFunc)\t// returns Dataset[(String, Long)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2017-02-08T05:34:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T05:36:19Z","closed_at":"2017-02-08T05:36:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5025cb7511a43e24cb3a181eb7b06c69b024479f","head":{"label":"tdas:mapWithState-branch-2.1","ref":"mapWithState-branch-2.1","sha":"5025cb7511a43e24cb3a181eb7b06c69b024479f","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe reason for test failure is that the  property “oracle.jdbc.mapDateToTimestamp” set by the test was getting converted into all lower case.  Oracle database expects this property in case-sensitive manner. \r\n\r\nThis test was passing in previous releases because connection properties were sent as user specified for the test case scenario. Fixes to handle all option uniformly in case-insensitive manner, converted the JDBC connection properties also to lower case.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes changes to treat only JDBC options meant for spark sql in case-insensitive manner , and pass the connection properties to the JDBC  connection.as user specified.\r\n\r\nAlternative approach PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16891  is to enhance CaseInsensitiveMap to keep track case-sensitive keys and use them when creating connection properties.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test cases to JdbcSuite , and OracleIntegrationSuite.  Ran docker integration tests passed on my laptop, all tests passed successfully.","created_at":"2017-02-08T01:30:12Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T23:52:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T23:52:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12d490382d88129abe1a82e0f584578fef8853ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/81e906052ea766fe4f228b84db5caea22860dae4","head":{"label":"sureshthalamati:jdbc_connection_props_fix-SPARK-19318","ref":"jdbc_connection_props_fix-SPARK-19318","sha":"81e906052ea766fe4f228b84db5caea22860dae4","user":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40833027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDgzMzAyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sureshthalamati/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati/spark","description":"Mirror

is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/73ee73945e369a862480ef4ac64e55c797bd7d90\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe optimizer tries to remove redundant alias only projections from the query plan using the `RemoveAliasOnlyProject` rule. The current rule identifies removes such a project and rewrites the project's attributes in the **entire** tree. This causes problems when parts of the tree are duplicated (for instance a self join on a temporary view/CTE)  and the duplicated part contains the alias only project, in this case the rewrite will break the tree.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these problems by using a blacklist for attributes that are not to be moved, and by making sure that attribute remapping is only done for the parent tree, and not for unrelated parts of the query plan.\r\n\r\nThe current tree transformation infrastructure works very well if the transformation at hand requires little or a global contextual information. In this case we need to know both the attributes that were not to be moved, and we also needed to know which child attributes were modified. This cannot be done easily using the current infrastructure, and solutions typically involves transversing the query plan multiple times (which is super slow). I have moved around some code in `TreeNode`, `QueryPlan` and `LogicalPlan`to make this much more straightforward; this basically allows you to manually traverse the tree.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have added unit tests to `RemoveRedundantAliasAndProjectSuite` and I have added integration tests to the `SQLQueryTestSuite.union` and `SQLQueryTestSuite.cte` test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nadded a limit to getRecords api call call in KinesisBackedBlockRdd. This helps reduce the amount of data returned by kinesis api call making the recovery considerably faster\r\n\r\nAs we are storing the `fromSeqNum` & `toSeqNum` in checkpoint metadata, we can also store the number of records. Which can later be used for api call.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was manually tested\r\n\r\nApologies for any silly mistakes, opening first pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive metastore is not case-preserving and keep partition columns with lower case names. If Spark SQL creates a table with upper-case partition column names using `HiveExternalCatalog`, when we rename partition, it first calls the HiveClient to renamePartition, which will create a new lower case partition path, then Spark SQL renames the lower case path to upper-case.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we rename a nested path, different file systems have different behaviors. e.g. in jenkins, renaming `a=1/b=2` to `A=2/B=2` will success, but leave an empty directory `a=1`. in mac os, the renaming doesn't work as expected and result to `a=1/B=2`.\r\n\r\nThis PR renames the partition directory recursively from the first partition column in `HiveExternalCatalog`, to be most compatible with different file systems.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`WritableConverter` and `WritableFactory` work in opposite directions. But both of them are documented with same description:\r\n\r\n> A class encapsulating how to convert some type T to Writable. It stores both the Writable class corresponding to T (e.g. IntWritable for Int) and a function for doing the conversion.\r\n\r\nThis error is a result of commit 2604939. As a note, `WritableFactory` was added from commit d37978d, which resolves [SPARK-4795](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4795) with the correct description.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the documentation of `WritableConverter`, along with some improvements on type description.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`build/mvn clean

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new metric \"number of generated rows\". It is used exclusively for Range, which is a leaf in the query tree, yet doesn't read any input data, and therefore cannot report \"recordsRead\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally the way in which the metrics are reported by the JIT-compiled version of Range was changed. Previously, it was immediately reported that all the records were produced. This could be confusing for a user monitoring execution progress in the UI. Now, the metric is updated gradually.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid negative impact on Range performance, the code generation was reworked. The values are now produced in batches in the tighter inner loop, while the metrics are updated in the outer loop.\r\n\r\nThe change also contains a number of unit tests, which should help ensure the correctness of metrics for various input sources.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2017-02-07T10:25:32Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T14:19:05Z","closed_at":"2017-02-07T13:23:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d816e7099ff3df5bdb3658d9c60a66e57eb7c11e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa6892a320dc098d8c3c517bed7caaa642059c17","head":{"label":"ala:SPARK-19447","ref":"SPARK-19447","sha":"aa6892a320dc098d8c3c517bed7caaa642059c17","user":{"login":"ala","id":166012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjAxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala","html_url":"https://github.com/ala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80839594,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDgzOTU5NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ala/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ala","id":166012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjAxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala","html_url":"https://github.com/ala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ala/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nafter [SPARK-19279](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19279), we could not create a Hive table with an empty schema,\r\nwe should tighten up the condition when create a hive table in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L835\r\n\r\nThat is if a CatalogTable t has an empty schema, and (there is no `spark.sql.schema.numParts` or its value is 0), we should not add a default `col` schema, if we did, a table with an empty schema will be created, that is not we expected.\r\n\r\nAdditional reason to do this PR is that, when I do the optimize duplicate functions in MetaStoreRelation in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16787, there is a function to merge `toHiveTable`  between `HiveClientImpl` and `HiveUtils`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L818\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveUtils.scala#L494\r\n\r\nthe problem when I do this merge is that `HiveClientImpl`'s `toHiveTable` will add a default `col` schema for an empty schema table, this will affect the `inferSchema` result to check if user want to create a table with an empty schema.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16636/files#diff-842e3447fc453de26c706db1cac8f2c4R586\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16636/files#diff-c4ed9859978dd6ac271b6a40ee945e4bR95

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no need to set 'spark.master' multi-times with different values. Second, It is possible for users to set the different 'spark.master' in code with\r\n`spark-submit` command, and will confuse himself. So, we should do once check if the 'spark.master' already exists in settings and if the previous value is the same with current value. Throw a IllegalArgumentException when previous value is different with current value.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have received many cases that users forgot to remove \"local[*]\" from code and submit it in command line. And many fresh users has no consciousness to check if job runs correctly in standalone mode or yarn mode. At last, the job will run on master node or gateway node all along.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd new unit test\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-07T03:28:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T10:11:49Z","closed_at":"2017-02-13T10:11:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c9658d6d2020797e87b78140ecb2a7e5b19cc48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8565f9750990b466b4b26f086b71e9e1720fed4d","head":{"label":"uncleGen:SPARK-19482","ref":"SPARK-19482","sha":"8565f9750990b466b4b26f086b71e9e1720fed4d","user":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23988410,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4ODQxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"uncleGen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen/spark","description":"Mirror
