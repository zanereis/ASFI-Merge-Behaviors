HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-17T01:13:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T16:03:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T16:03:41Z","merged_at":"2018-05-17T16:03:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e42515b777f63b623739d807396c1b5a0f7ec18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4e50f02252f9e9ba186e59c9864ee7dd2b3aa9f7","head":{"label":"tgroh:idgen_move","ref":"idgen_move","sha":"4e50f02252f9e9ba186e59c9864ee7dd2b3aa9f7","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [N/A] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [N/A] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [*] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [*] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [*] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [N/A] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-17T01:10:07Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T00:51:17Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T00:51:17Z","merged_at":"2018-06-15T00:51:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba62679f9ebd9266f6cbea84aa1196cfac30d451","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f3206455a892c9ea1c2b521ab6a31905a4818ae9","head":{"label":"ringw:taggedoutput","ref":"taggedoutput","sha":"f3206455a892c9ea1c2b521ab6a31905a4818ae9","user":{"login":"ringw","id":1391644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTE2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1391644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw","html_url":"https://github.com/ringw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133738794,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3Mzg3OTQ=","name":"beam","full_name":"ringw/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ringw","id":1391644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTE2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1391644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw","html_url":"https://github.com/ringw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ringw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ringw/beam","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

in this PR:\r\n1. \"Python PostCommit\" and \"Python Dataflow ValidatesRunner\" tests now use `run_postcommits.sh` to run.\r\n2. This makes `run_validatesrunner.sh` obsolete, so I remove it.\r\n3. Jenkins job to run ValidatesRunner as part of Gradle\r\n  3.1 Renaming the ValidatesRunner tests to `\"beam_PostCommit_Py_VR_Dataflow\"`, to have a shorter job name.\r\n4. Small change to `dependency.py` to avoid having `pip` prompt for use input during isntallation of dependencies.\r\n\r\nPassing tests:\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Py_VR_Dataflow/6/

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-14T20:53:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T00:04:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-16T00:04:00Z","merged_at":"2018-05-16T00:04:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dc9bc1d16e70249f30689a6f941cb1707b6b564","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/413b70ba64c364d0a89f2303622037b162ceef2b","head":{"label":"tweise:BEAM-4127.flinkPortableStreamingTranslation","ref":"BEAM-4127.flinkPortableStreamingTranslation","sha":"413b70ba64c364d0a89f2303622037b162ceef2b","user":{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59848217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTg0ODIxNw==","name":"beam","full_name":"tweise/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tweise/beam","description":"Mirror

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-11T21:36:37Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T22:02:46Z","closed_at":"2018-05-11T22:02:41Z","merged_at":"2018-05-11T22:02:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"6672becc7888b63cd222d35bf3e84b9e0a58726a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e0bef027f4ad088ece020c9b621b32f5780ea4cc","head":{"label":"tweise:fixRemoteExecutionTest","ref":"fixRemoteExecutionTest","sha":"e0bef027f4ad088ece020c9b621b32f5780ea4cc","user":{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59848217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTg0ODIxNw==","name":"beam","full_name":"tweise/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tweise/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [n/a] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [n/a] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-09T13:50:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T12:26:18Z","closed_at":"2018-05-15T12:26:18Z","merged_at":"2018-05-15T12:26:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7913a92f88aa1d4d3d4d926c04217640b853b5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5315/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5315/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5315/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/8d70a5d6d011d36933020d6e77aae813ff06bd48","head":{"label":"mareksimunek:dsl-euphoria","ref":"dsl-euphoria","sha":"8d70a5d6d011d36933020d6e77aae813ff06bd48","user":{"login":"mareksimunek","id":8159699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk2OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8159699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek","html_url":"https://github.com/mareksimunek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132132206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzIxMzIyMDY=","name":"beam","full_name":"mareksimunek/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mareksimunek","id":8159699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk2OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8159699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek","html_url":"https://github.com/mareksimunek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mareksimunek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mareksimunek/beam","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-09T00:05:29Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T20:57:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-11T20:57:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec0d554827d1cdf00cd0f5eda145ca90120f5263","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/bcd4f67444c9bdeb9a79f6b51710508503f37ed5","head":{"label":"tgroh:reduce_control_client_visibility","ref":"reduce_control_client_visibility","sha":"bcd4f67444c9bdeb9a79f6b51710508503f37ed5","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

[JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T08:35:57Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T20:17:03Z","closed_at":"2018-05-16T20:17:03Z","merged_at":"2018-05-16T20:17:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e698901336b3499ad48d1bd2110963e45f364b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/708a79e3f8a8eb5d0bb964aeb391c8ece9e38214","head":{"label":"lukecwik:side_input2","ref":"side_input2","sha":"708a79e3f8a8eb5d0bb964aeb391c8ece9e38214","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

[ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T01:07:59Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T21:21:36Z","closed_at":"2018-05-14T21:21:30Z","merged_at":"2018-05-14T21:21:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"22d5cc6cdb03331992785ac1d4886ee61f0895f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/280d05aa86f5224191d51871099f9bfb26751e41","head":{"label":"angoenka:refactor_py_ulr","ref":"refactor_py_ulr","sha":"280d05aa86f5224191d51871099f9bfb26751e41","user":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108601385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg2MDEzODU=","name":"beam","full_name":"angoenka/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"angoenka","id":38219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka","html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angoenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/angoenka/beam","description":"Mirror

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T00:06:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T07:40:31Z","closed_at":"2018-05-08T16:46:27Z","merged_at":"2018-05-08T16:46:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c1e2feabbf48714ff78cda965186c11ab4a4434","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"echauchot","id":8821084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjEwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot","html_url":"https://github.com/echauchot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echauchot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/d4eb5e8c3c72a68c60f50b16076976d4eb57d159","head":{"label":"tgroh:ignore_leaking_thread","ref":"ignore_leaking_thread","sha":"d4eb5e8c3c72a68c60f50b16076976d4eb57d159","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
