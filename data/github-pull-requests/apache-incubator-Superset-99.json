SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new endpoint at `api/v1/database/validate_parameters` for validating separate parameters when adding/editing a database. With this flow, users can add databases by passing DB-specific parameters (username, password, host, port, etc.) instead of the full SQLAlchemy URI.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nIn this PR refactor:\r\n1. Updated applying of native filters in first loading:\r\n - Saving in native filters metadata also extraFormData: `defaultValue` removed, now we use `defaultDataMask`\r\n - All filters now initializing with `{ filterState: { value: null } }`\r\n - Cleaned logic on saving FiltersConfig modal to avoid reload charts until user clicks `Apply`\r\n2. Fixed double loading of charts data on first loading if there exists cross filter on dashboard\r\n3. To initialize charts data with filters no need more wait until all filters will be loading\r\n4. Fixed FilterSets `Rebuild` option\r\n5. Added migration to update native filter and filter set state\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR is that application deployment typically involves referencing env vars to one degree or another. For example, some dynamic values in kubernetes (e.g., host ips) are easily exposed through env vars but not readily available otherwise. Additionally, it may make sense to have static configuration in the file and handle secrets (e.g., `jwtSecret`) a little differently.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nUnit tests,

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR does a few things.\r\n1) Imports the latest `superset-ui/core` which includes all required Emotion modules\r\n2) Pulls all Emotion imports from Superset-UI\r\n3) Removes Emotion from Superset\r\n4) Adds linting rule to prevent future direct `@emotion/core` use\r\n\r\nThe intent of all of the above is _part of_ the effort to get the dual-React-Apps to play nicely together in production. This should be visible when the global nav on these dual-app pages (e.g. Sql Editor or Explore view) looks consistent with the single-app pages (CRUD views, homepage). \r\n\r\nReference reading about

SUMMARY\r\nWe wanted more robust messaging in Sql Lab that tells user what, if anything, is limiting the results that they get when they run a SQL query. Currently this file will also include a database migration, we are going to wait for this migration to resolve before we continue with this PR.\r\n\r\nBecause of the varied heights of the alert component, this PR will also fix some of the code in SQL Editor and SouthPane that uses static height. \r\n\r\nThis has custom messages that are based on: \r\n-  DISPLAY_MAX_ROW causing the results to be limited (admin and non-admin messaging)\r\n-  The query itself limiting the options\r\n- the dropdown limiting results\r\n- the default dropdown of 1000 being the cause for the limit\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user creates a native filter, display only datasets used in current dashboard as options in dataset picker. When user starts typing, send a query to backend for other available datasets.\r\nE.g. there are datasets \"a_dataset\", \"b_dataset\" and \"c_dataset\". If the current dashboard uses datasets \"a_dataset\" and \"b_dataset\", only those 2 will be displayed in dataset picker in native filters modal. When user starts typing \"c...\" in dataset picker, \"c_dataset\" will be fetched from backend and displayed as an option.\r\nIf a dashboard uses only 1 dataset, that dataset will be used as a default initial value in the dataset picker. If the dashboard uses more datasets, no default value will be used.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nYak shaving at its finest. This PR started due to the fact that some of the database engine specs had the following import logic,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom superset import app\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich was very problematic due to potential circular imports and app contexts which needed to be invoked. For testing we required magical logic like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tests.test_app import app\r\n```\r\n\r\nprior to importing the actual engine spec.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the engine specs are decoupled from the Flask app and use the `flask.current_app` where necessary when the application configuration is required. \r\n\r\nNote what started out as somewhat of a benign change quickly spiraled out of control in order to ensure that the tests passed as more and more code needed to be touched. The TL;DR is:\r\n\r\n- ~~Even though this logic could further be improved, in my opinion the approach is in the direction of the north star, i.e., removing the dependency for `tests.test_app` and using the `app` `pytest` fixture instead.~~\r\n- ~~The `app` fixture is scoped to the function which ensures that the tests are idempotent and thus the `app.config` neither i) needs to be mocked, or ii) reset upon completion of the test.~~\r\n- ~~Migrates a subset of tests to be more `pytest` like so we can leverage the `app` fixture.~~ \r\n\r\nThis logic was retracted because even though the individual tests passed they failed as part of the test suite and further debugging the issue resulted in a real nightmare.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if

SUMMARY\r\nUpdates default cron settings in the Add Alert and Add Report modals from \"every minute\" to \"every hour\"\r\n\r\n#### rationale: \r\nPreset users are setting alerts at a higher frequency than expected, which is sometimes causing issues with queuing and the system getting backed up.\r\nSetting the default schedule to a less frequent cadence may help set the users expectation that the alerts aren't meant to be set up to be checking every minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nbefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-04-26 at 5 23 04

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to build one's own docker image when using superset on production. However a custom docker image contains confidential information, e.g. the `SECRET_KEY` configuration value. Thus it is necessary to use a docker image hosted in a private registry. Access credentials to a private docker registry are usually provided to Kubernetes via the `imagePullSecrets` field, which references to a secret containing the credentials.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible to configure this via the `values.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14267 added support for alerts/reports (and thumbnails) to the docker file it makes sense to use the dev image in `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` so that users can take advantage of the alerts/reports functionality. This PR also bumps redis to `latest` as it's already being used in the default docker compose file. \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently when sorting a filter box select by metric, the ordering isn't being applied in the query, making it possible for relevant rows to be missing in the query if they fall below the default 1000 row limit.\r\n\r\nThis was found while working on adding feature parity to the native select filter.

SUMMARY\r\nThe `check_datasource_access` decorator calls `can_access_table`, which seems to make sense from the name. However, this decorator is used in the databases API to fetch metadata for tables, not to fetch actual data. This results in some confusing SQL Lab behavior:\r\n*  Users can select a table that they don't have access to, but they will see the confusing message: `An error occurred while fetching table metadata. Please contact your administrator.`\r\n* The table remains in the left hand panel, with no columns displayed. Users are unable to remove the table (`An error occurred while removing the table schema. Please contact your administrator.`), but it disappears on refresh\r\n\r\nThis PR alters `check_datasource_access` to use `get_datasources_accessible_by_user` instead of `can_access_table`. This is more consistent with how SQL Lab currently fetches tables and schemas for the drop down. Users will be able to see the columns of the table, but the table preview will error due to lack of data access, as intended.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nConfirmed that column metadata successfully loaded for tables that previously had failed. Confirmed `select_star` and `table_metadata` endpoints worked as expected.\r\n\r\nWill fix tests.\r\n\r\n@john-bodley @etr2460

SUMMARY\r\nIt enhances the `Icons` component with dynamic imports and auto-generation of `aria-label`. As a POC, it changes the existing `alert-solid` icon with the new `Icons.AlertSolid` implementation.\r\n\r\n##### Remarks:\r\nAs the Icons are now dynamically imported, test cases need to wait for the Icons to be imported and re-rendered to pass without warnings. In a react-testing-library setup, this translates to using the `findBy*` promise-based approach as shown in this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE / AFTER:\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a query object is using `columns` over `groupby`, the timeseries limit is not applied.

charts are rendering errors when `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` is turned on (#14289).\r\n\r\nSome of the fixes:\r\n\r\n1. The background worker stores the `form_data` to be used for validation on subsequent requests when clients request the query results. However, `form_data` is mutated by the code that runs the query and the background worker is storing the mutated object. Since this object is used to derive a unique cache key, any mutations to it will lead to a different key and, subsequently, a cache miss.\r\n2. Even if 1 is solved, in some case, the code will modify `form_data` in a non-deterministic way _before_ the cache key is derived from the object (e.g., adding UUIDs to it). This will always lead to a unique cache key.\r\n3. There were two cases where deduplicating lists seemed to introduce the potential for lists to get out of sync in terms of ordering, causing a different cache key when I _think_ ordering doesn't matter here. Sorting them will ensure the same results. Either way, the ordering should be the same given the same input, and that wasn't always the case.\r\n\r\n_Note: even though this is broken in the async queries experience, it will benefit everyone since these fixes should prevent unnecessary cache misses in the regular flow._\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-22T00:12:29Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T23:37:08Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T19:14:56Z","merged_at":"2021-04-28T19:14:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7f5100833d2b7ef6e5110c794942199d598537a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe want to create an interface to allow us to overwrite specific error messages in superset. So we've create a config that allow you to overwrite specific error message coming back from the API. \r\n\r\nThis is built on top of SIP-40 + SIP-41\r\n\r\nBy adding a superset_text.yaml with the following structure you'll be able to overwrite and error.\r\n```\r\n# superset_text.yaml\r\nERRORS:  \r\n  GENERIC_BACKEND_ERROR: \"We were unable to connect to your database. Please visit our documentation at docs.preset.io or reach out to support@preset.io for assistance.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"929\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-20 at 3 23 22 PM\"
