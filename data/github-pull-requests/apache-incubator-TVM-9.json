to this commit, `structlog.configure(...)` would only impact log statements generated in the main process, while workers started with `disco.session.ProcessSession` would not inherit the `structlog` configuration.  While `disco.session.ThreadedSession` would inherit the `structlog` configuration, it would also inherit process-specific CUDA variables.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `disco.session.ProcessSession` to explicitly propagate any `structlog` configuration to child processes.  This implementation intentionally avoids introducing a new dependency for TVM.  If the `structlog` package is not available, the config propagation is skipped.","created_at":"2024-02-21T17:33:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T12:52:33Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T10:09:21Z","merged_at":"2024-03-12T10:09:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"1278c3544d15d6b743073ba1058e5efbfc2894f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/208d4441c4899e17161628ecca014ece8f4b7c38","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_propagate_structlog_configuration_to_workers","ref":"disco_propagate_structlog_configuration_to_workers","sha":"208d4441c4899e17161628ecca014ece8f4b7c38","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

incorrect keyword-argument naming with ``EllipticCurvePrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X25519PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X448PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  and

raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

tuple.","created_at":"2024-02-16T22:04:42Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T15:42:20Z","closed_at":"2024-02-22T15:42:18Z","merged_at":"2024-02-22T15:42:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"5308ef135d6afaf0ae3f5554373cdced89928cdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6554ed3f3e3f95fe347ccebf6258ef9049778343","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:lazy_transform_params_non_tuple_inputs","ref":"lazy_transform_params_non_tuple_inputs","sha":"6554ed3f3e3f95fe347ccebf6258ef9049778343","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, calling `FuseOpsByPattern` with `annotate_codegen=True` would cause an error when encountering a lambda function.  This was caused by the `CompositeFunctionAnnotator` asserting that all `relax::Function` encountered must have the `kComposite` attribute.  While this is true for all lambda functions produced by `FuseOpsByPattern`, the user may have defined other lambda functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `CompositeFunctionAnnotator` to ignore lambda functions that do not have a `kComposite` attribute.","created_at":"2024-02-16T19:55:22Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T04:18:58Z","closed_at":"2024-02-21T01:07:51Z","merged_at":"2024-02-21T01:07:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"d91fe450c82e43b9c48ae997beb10419ca078f93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/76c1708018d2bdcf4d5a207100ff8682be6cf09d","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:transform_ignore_non_composite_in_fuse_ops","ref":"transform_ignore_non_composite_in_fuse_ops","sha":"76c1708018d2bdcf4d5a207100ff8682be6cf09d","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `LiftTransformParams` would extract out all variable binding that have no runtime dependencies.  As a result, expressions such as `R.zeros([16], \"int32\")` would be extracted out into the parameter transformation, even though they do not depend on any parameters.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `LiftTransformParams` to only output variables that depend on at least one compile-time parameter.\r\n\r\nThe unit test for this functionality also found that `relax::Call` was erroneously calling `MarkGraphNode` in `SEqualReduce` and `SHashReduce`.  This should only be called for nodes that have have reference equality, such as `relax::Var`, and not for composite objects.  This caused erroneous failures in the unit test when two instances of `R.zeros([16], \"int32\")` were being compared by reference equality in `StructuralEqual`.  These extra calls to `MarkGraphNode` have been removed.","created_at":"2024-02-16T19:31:23Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T14:07:17Z","closed_at":"2024-02-29T14:07:10Z","merged_at":"2024-02-29T14:07:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"e261a270365a6810c4e862caa1a8d83607182c81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2390033807a7c034d51bcc988b28a9d06a0d011e","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_only_lift_if_params_used","ref":"relax_only_lift_if_params_used","sha":"2390033807a7c034d51bcc988b28a9d06a0d011e","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

determining whether to evaluate matrix multiplications as `(A*B)*C` or as `A*(B*C)`, dynamic shapes may occur (e.g. a dynamic LoRA rank).  This commit tests for these cases, and improves the arithmetic bounds used to prove which order of evaluation is preferred.\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation, this commit also adds a utility `CollectNonNegativeExpressions`, exposed to the python API as `relax.analysis.collect_non_negative_expresisons`.  This utility collects expressions within a `StructInfo` which must be non-negative, based on the location where they appear.  For example, the size of a tensor along each dimension must be non-negative.  Unlike the existing `defineable_tir_vars_in_struct_info`, this will include the `N-2` expression in `R.Tensor([N-2])`.","created_at":"2024-02-16T17:27:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T20:17:57Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T19:46:22Z","merged_at":"2024-05-13T19:46:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"0dfc5f955e2dd883527638e3d5b1f6844971af3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/517a93d858b8b3eadf130dbd7284438fc10ceeb5","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_adjust_matmul_order_with_permute_dims","ref":"relax_adjust_matmul_order_with_permute_dims","sha":"517a93d858b8b3eadf130dbd7284438fc10ceeb5","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

of the form `(A+B)*C < (A*B)*D` can occur occur when comparing the number of operations required for two different orderings in which matrix multiplications can be performed. Proving or disproving this conditional allows an optimal order of execution to be selected, even for dynamic argument shapes.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of `ConstIntBounds` assumes that each term in an expression is independent.  For example, the maximum value of `(A+B)*C - (A*B)*D` is determined by taking the maximum value of `(A+B)*C` and subtracting the minimum value of `(A*B)*D`.  This algorithm can be applied in all cases, but can provide a bound that is looser than strictly required.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a check for this case in `ConstIntBounds`, to provide a tighter bound of possible values.  When `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are all positive values, as is the case for tensor shapes, the inequality can be written as `1/A + 1/B < D/C`.  If this inequality holds for the minimum values of `A`, `B`, and `D`, along with the maximum value of `C`, then it holds for all values.","created_at":"2024-02-16T17:14:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T19:35:36Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T19:25:30Z","merged_at":"2024-03-18T19:25:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"95ec38be98767e851e06e94393147f0321e98324","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/18778b84f2668115e8a8091bf87de75623128b07","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:arith_tighter_bounds_for_const_int","ref":"arith_tighter_bounds_for_const_int","sha":"18778b84f2668115e8a8091bf87de75623128b07","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for partitioning and compiling the Marvell BYOC target along with initial integration with tvmc. Support for the runtime (simulator based & hardware) and other features (int8) will be added in phases as described in the pre-RFC post: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/prerfc-byoc-integrating-marvell-ml-ai-accelerator-to-the-tvm-byoc-framework/16155.\r\n\r\n **Please see the pre-RFC for a detailed description of the design and roadmap going forward.**\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\nWe have introduced a new cmake flag:\r\n**USE_MRVL=ON/OFF**\r\n\r\nThis flag enables Marvell BYOC codegen and is required for using the Marvell BYOC functionality, running unit tests, etc.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe tvmc interface for Marvell BYOC will be similar to other composite targets. \r\n\r\nThe below command is an example of cross-compilation of an ONNX model for an Octeon target.\r\n\r\n python3 -m tvm.driver.tvmc compile \r\n         --target=\"mrvl, llvm\" \\\r\n        --target-llvm-mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu \\\r\n        --target-llvm-mcpu=neoverse-n2 \\\r\n        --target-mrvl-num_tiles=4 \\\r\n        --cross-compiler aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \\\r\n        --output model.tar \\\r\n

is capable of expressing tensors whose element type is unknown.  However, these must typically be replaced with a known dtype prior to compilation, as most operators require known data types prior to legalization.  This can be done by using a `relax::MatchCast` node, such as accepting a parameter `arg: R.Tensor([16,16])`, then defining the dtype using `R.match_cast(arg, R.Tensor([16,16],'float16'))`.\r\n\r\nHowever, using a `R.match_cast` node requires knowing which data type should be used in the new `R.Tensor`, and raises an error for an incorrect data type.  If an argument may be one of two distinct data types, `R.match_cast` cannot be used to check which data type is in use.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds Relax operators to read the runtime values of a `DLTensor*` argument.  These can be be used to normalize arguments prior to a compute step.  For example, pre-processing a model weight that may be provided in either `float16` or `bfloat16` format.","created_at":"2024-02-13T18:45:44Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T20:59:17Z","closed_at":"2024-02-20T20:59:14Z","merged_at":"2024-02-20T20:59:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"b21855758e40057e1b4d7f10410ed7bfb36aa808","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7593bc39a38f51a207b92a067dcd9c06ad847ae7","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_unpack_ops","ref":"relax_unpack_ops","sha":"7593bc39a38f51a207b92a067dcd9c06ad847ae7","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, if a lowered `IRModule` does not contain any TIR functions, `tvm.relax.build` provided an empty `tir_mod`, which caused a segfault during TIR compilation.  This could occur when `tvm.relax.build` is called without an explicit target argument, for a module that does not define any virtual devices.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `_filter_tir` utility function to return `None` if there are no TIR functions, rather than an empty `IRModule`.  In addition, checks for an empty `IRModule` are added to `tvm.build` and `TIRToRuntime`, so that a similar failure mode would raise an exception rather than producing a segfault.","created_at":"2024-02-13T18:14:16Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:07:31Z","closed_at":"2024-02-14T13:07:28Z","merged_at":"2024-02-14T13:07:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"7336debd8d12e21301fc3c8dde4c2c5c90766aed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dafe4117da32cca32e1ac2f5d414cbc4bb1e8f12","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_remove_build_of_empty_tir_module","ref":"bugfix_remove_build_of_empty_tir_module","sha":"dafe4117da32cca32e1ac2f5d414cbc4bb1e8f12","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

optimize i4_to_f16 decoding, we can use some advanced hardware instructions to do fast type conversion to alleviate the cost of decoding, we can do that by tensorize in tvm.\r\n\r\nTo tensorize

PR introduces various WebGPU changes to accommodate the new `PagedKVCache` interface. All changes below are essential for making models that use PagedKVCache runnable under WebGPU:\r\n\r\n- Require exactly same-dtype matching for WebGPU smem reuse in `storage_rewrite.cc`\r\n- Rename `AttentionKVCache` to `AttentionKVCacheLegacy` for the old KVcache interface in `lm_support.cc`; include `paged_kv_cache.cc` when making `wasm_runtime` subsequently\r\n- In WebGPU codegen:\r\n  - Declare local variables within the function scope rather than the module scope\r\n  - Generate `while (true)` rather than `while (1)`\r\n- Require 10 `maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage` rather than the default 8 from the WebGPU device when initializing runtime; this is required for new kernels introduced in PagedKVCache\r\n- In `deviceCopyToCPU()`, when raw bytes to write are not multiples of 4, we pad them, as required by WebGPU's `writeBuffer()`.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Rick Zhou

current implementation of `block_access_region_detector` does not consider the let bindings inside the block. To be more specific:\r\n\r\n- The let bindings inside the block can be the index of buffer access indices\r\n- The let bindings var is defined inside the block, so the block annotation cannot use those vars.\r\n- We need to substitute the let bindings inside the block to the block annotation.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem and can create legal

to this commit, the `MakePackedAPI` pass would output steps in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Check the number of arguments.\r\n2. All `LetStmt` produced by the `ArgBinder`\r\n3. `AssertStmt` for the Type code checks for each argument.\r\n4. Additional `AssertStmt` produced by the `ArgBinder`.\r\n\r\nThis order can cause segfaults if a function was provided incorrect arguments.  For example, an integer argument passed to a function expecting a `DLTensor*` would be dereferenced to find the tensor's data pointer (step (2)) before checking if it is valid to perform that dereference (step (3)).  The same would occur when reading the size of a tensor's axes (step (2)) before checking whether the tensor is the correct dimensionality (step (4)).\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the steps to the following order.\r\n\r\n1. Check the number of arguments.\r\n2. Check the type code of each argument.\r\n3. All `LetStmt` and `AssertStmt` produced by the `ArgBinder`, in the order in which they are generated.","created_at":"2024-02-08T01:10:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T23:29:50Z","closed_at":"2024-04-04T23:29:45Z","merged_at":"2024-04-04T23:29:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd08356e66951ec6eceb9dbd7ea21289a350eae8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/738a76f435becd01f4ad986f7b518d9e53699cd9","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_reorder_dlpack_asserts","ref":"tir_reorder_dlpack_asserts","sha":"738a76f435becd01f4ad986f7b518d9e53699cd9","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, calls from Relax to external PackedFuncs could only be done through the TVM global registry.  While Relax functions accepting a callback could be written as `callback_arg: R.Callable(arg_struct_info, ret_struct_info)`, attempting to compile these functions would raise an error during the `CodeGenVM` step of `relax.build`.  In addition, the global registry is only queried when initializing the `relax.VirtualMachine`, and so later changes requires restarting the VM.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates both the `CodeGenVM` lowering pass and the relax VM to support callbacks.  The motivating use case is with the `LazyTransformParams` pass, to improve flexibility by avoiding use of the global registry.","created_at":"2024-02-08T01:05:56Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T20:46:17Z","closed_at":"2024-02-13T18:07:09Z","merged_at":"2024-02-13T18:07:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c5ee30630760b3e42202e622517a92c18f11889","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/81d6db50c9ab377ac88192034b1b416bbfbc2b3f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_vm_callback_argument","ref":"relax_vm_callback_argument","sha":"81d6db50c9ab377ac88192034b1b416bbfbc2b3f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst\">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate revocation list signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added ``mgf`` property to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS`.\n* Added ``algorithm`` and ``mgf`` properties to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.OAEP`.\n* Added the following properties that return timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update_utc`.\n  These are timezone-aware variants of existing properties that return naïve\n  ``datetime`` objects.\n* Deprecated the following properties that return naïve ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update`\n  in favor of the new timezone-aware variants mentioned above.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ChaCha20`\n  on LibreSSL.\n* Added support for RSA PSS signatures in PKCS7 with\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change will allow us to express scalable vectors through Ramp and Broadcast nodes, e.g.\r\n```\r\nvec = tvm.tir.expr.Ramp(0, 1, 4 * tvm.tir.vscale())\r\n```\r\nWe will use negative values for `runtime::DataType` the encode the scalable lane values, e.g. the above example would result in `lanes` = -4. That's because the lanes in `runtime::DataType` are tied to DLPack standard which uses `uint16_t` for the lanes. The conversion happens in the node definitions and `runtime::DataType`, so the `int` and `uint16_t` values should never be exposed to the API user, especially after the string support has been added.\r\n\r\nAlso include the TVMScript support for scalable Ramp and Broadcasts.\r\n\r\nNote that this patch doesn't include lowering to the appropriate LLVM vectors, support for data type string representation or `LoopVectorizer` support. All of these will be part of future patches.","created_at":"2024-02-05T16:07:26Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T09:13:46Z","closed_at":"2024-02-20T09:13:30Z","merged_at":"2024-02-20T09:13:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6157a6369c184b6fa5f66654feb685e58726737","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/60e7d831702e6d73d053efcefe93cd203ea5fa52","head":{"label":"ekalda:p2-scalable-ramps2","ref":"p2-scalable-ramps2","sha":"60e7d831702e6d73d053efcefe93cd203ea5fa52","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215831751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU4MzE3NTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ekalda/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda/tvm","description":"Open

PR fixes the StorageRewrite pass which failed to avoid shared memory reuse of different dtypes for Vulkan.\r\n\r\nSince the Vulkan target information is required at the time of lowering, the pass `BindTarget` needs to apply before lowering, so that the functions have correct target information. Note that previously the pass checks `Target::Current`, while `tvm.build` does not set the current target.\r\n\r\nOne regression test is

Relax passes that rely on dataflow blocks do not explicitly state that they do. This is relevant for the phase ordering, since `ToNonDataflow` is eventually used. Additionally, if a user did not manually insert dataflow blocks, the pass `ConvertToDataflow` can be used to automatically extract dataflow blocks. This PR adds doc comments for passes that do depend on DF blocks and also adds notes suggesting the use of `ConvertToDataflow` to ensure that there will be DF blocks for these passes (if

when a default compile target such as `llvm` is specified, it implies `llvm -keys=cpu` which tends to imply x86 related components being used during compilation e.g. the schedules registered in TOPI. This can be confusing for a user when compiling on other architectures, especially when other tools such as `llc` infer the default target based on the host.\r\n\r\nWhen the target kind is `llvm`, this commit uses the \"target.llvm_get_system_triple\" functionality to automatically detect\r\n`mtriple` when one has not been provided in the target string. The target will be updated to one that uses the `mtriple` of the host: `llvm -> llvm -mtriple=<system-triple>`. When compiling on Arm(R)-based targets, this has the added benefit of automatically introducing `-keys=arm_cpu` to the target improving the schedule selection.\r\n\r\nLots of tests are currently using targets such as `llvm` or similar which has resulted in a lack of coverage of other targets such as `arm_cpu`. As part of this commit, failing test cases which have simple / obvious issues have been fixed. Others that likely need more thought have been skipped. In doing so, it reduces the number of modifications and simplifies the review for this change.\r\n\r\nNote: ~This PR is marked as draft while checking and fixing other failures in CI.
