I was thinking about making it dynamic, but this would require all weights and biases to be stored in untyped lists, which I feared would kill performance. \r\n- For now the implementation does not add any tests, as it's rather a demonstration of how SystemDS can be used and not a part that can easily be reused for a different use case. Also, I wasn't sure what to test against, since the network doesn't have any clear expected output.\r\n- I now implemented it as a script file rather than as a built-in functions, as built-ins would cross-reference each other and also make use of the NN-library, which itself isn't a built-in. If these issues are resolved, it could, however, be ported over to a built-in.\r\n\r\nEDIT (by @j143): (A different PR can also be opened for the following, if you like!)\r\n- [ ] Regarding testing, we do some [gradient checking](https://github.com/apache/systemml/blob/405462e84ad1192e447bb09c03fe20d112bf6afb/scripts/nn/test/grad_check.dml#L1133) like `fm`.\r\n- [ ] If you are planning add to NCF documentation. A pointer would be [FM doc](https://github.com/apache/systemml/pull/729/files)\r\nor you can simply add a TODO.

patch updates the weighted scheme by adding an elaborated scoring function. The function has two components - a ratio of compute time, in-memory size, and a last-used timestamp. The components are associated with weights, which can tune the eviction policies (e.g. weights 0 and 1 for time/size and timestamp respectively translate to LRU scheme). This patch also replaces the earlier PriorityQueye by a TreeSet.","created_at":"2020-05-18T15:23:03Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T19:04:12Z","closed_at":"2020-05-26T19:04:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"215a026adeed32943e64e4e5014ce777655946f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/79807dbe84199a239b4fa836487f18eb0d4d2dbe","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:lincost5","ref":"lincost5","sha":"79807dbe84199a239b4fa836487f18eb0d4d2dbe","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

a `SystemDSContext` object which has to be used for the function calls which generate the input data for our SystemDS script.

The Context will automatically be closed once we leave the `with`.\r\n\r\nA `SystemDSContext` object has to be used to generate the calls at the start of our Script like `matrix`, `seq` etc.\r\nWe can

responsibilities.\r\nThe main goal of the refactoring was to reduce the amount of bindings\r\nto CompressedMatrixBlock from the different types of ColGroups, to enable\r\neasy addition of new types of groups. (without reducing performance!)\r\n\r\nA list of new groups and other tasks associated with this is added to\r\n/docs/tasks.txt .\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the tests added for the compression work based on an\r\nestimation tolerance, allowing the estimations inside the system to be\r\noff by a set factor. In the tests, this has to be expanded upon to\r\nenable better precision in how the estimations are calculated.\r\n\r\nBellow is an extract of the different changes:\r\n\r\n- Separated sub-parts of compression into different packages.\r\n- Array memory footprint worst case calculations.\r\n- Moved Compressed Size Estimation Calculation to specific ColGroups\r\n\r\n- Extensive testing of size Estimation of ColGroups and compression\r\n  - Jol Memory Estimate tests for compression blocks\r\n  - Using worst case Jol Estimate JVM using uncompressed 64-bit JVM\r\n  - Ideal input generator for testing Col groups compression.\r\n\r\n- Factory pattern added for selected constructors\r\n  - ColGroups\r\n    - NameChange from ColGroupCompressor to ColGroupFactory\r\n  - CompressedMatrixBlock\r\n\r\n- Enable the parallel execution of the ColGrouping (previously disabled)\r\n\r\n- Settings File added for Compression to enable selection of specific\r\n  compression types. This can be extended with settings loaded from\r\n  DMLConfig\r\n  - This is constructed using a builder pattern such that invocation is\r\n  private.\r\n\r\n- Added abstract compressed block for overwriting default MatrixBlock\r\n\r\n- Add Test Libs to pom.xml\r\n  - Memory estimator framework JOL from OpenJDK to measure object

original issue i noticed was when the conditional predicate in the if-expression didn't seem what i was used to as in the C-programming language (where negative values were interpreted as _false_ while the converse values were interpreted as _true_) and that caused some discomfort.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of the issue\r\n```\r\n// This is a session i ran from running SystemML\r\nscala> import org.apache.sysml.api.mlcontext._\r\nscala> import org.apache.sysml.api.mlcontext.ScriptFactory._\r\nscala> val ml = new MLContext(spark)\r\nscala> val s = dml(\"\"\" if(-42) print(\"Yes!\") else print(\"No!\") \"\"\")\r\nscala> ml.execute(s)\r\nYes!\r\n```\r\nIn the Scala programming language, this would be a type-error\r\n```\r\nscala> if (-31) println(\"yes\") else println(\"no\")\r\n           ^\r\n       error: type mismatch;\r\n        found   : Int(-31)\r\n        required: Boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo i started mucking around _Antlr4_ and start poking around and discovered a potential fix for it.

Creating this PR on behalf of @thomas9t and hence will be merged with @thomas9t as the author.\r\n- The current implementation extends JMLC's `readMatrix` and `GPUContext` API.\r\n- The serving system is implemented in Scala using Akka and is available in the `org.apache.sysml.api.ml.serving`.\r\n- Minor cleanup and refactoring required before it's ready to be used by the general public will be done in subsequent commits.\r\n- It still remains unclear whether CUDA and Serving code should be included in future standalone releases. If yes, it will greatly simplify the deployment, else the user will have to build standalone jar before deployment.\r\n- The serving system can be started by:\r\n```\r\nmvn -Djcuda.scope=compile -Dserving.scope=compile package -P standalone-jar\r\njava -jar systemml-*-standalone.jar org.apache.sysml.api.ml.serving.PredictionService -port 8099 -scheduler scheduler -admin_password admin\r\n```\r\n- The model can be then registered using `http://localhost:8099/register-model` and user can invoke prediction using `http://localhost:8099/predict` service.\r\n\r\n@thomas9t

`GPUMemoryManager.clearTemporaryMemory()` we deallocate pointers but do not set the corresponding `Pointer` slots to `null` in the associated `GPUObject` instances. This can lead to attempted double-freeing of Pointers which results in an exception. This PR fixes this issue by creating a list of GPU objects associated with Pointers that have been freed as part of `clearTemporaryMemory()` and setting the corresponding pointer slots to `null`. This PR also addresses a minor issue with cleanup in JMLC which was causing Pointers for pinned data to be improperly cleared. Note this PR will reduce performance of `GPUMemoryManager.clearTemporaryMemory()` because it is now necessary to search through the list of managed `GPUObjects` to find the ones corresponding to pointers being freed. However, this method is only called once at the end of script invocation and so the performance cost will be small.\r\n\r\n@niketanpansare can you please take a look and let me know what you

PR adds support for compilation and execution of GPU enabled scripts in JMLC and harmonizes the pipeline used to compile and execute DML programs across the JMLC, MLContext and DMLScript. Specifically, the following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. All three APIs now call ScriptExecutorUtils.compileRuntimeProgram to compile DML scripts. The original logic in MLContext and JMLC for pinning inputs and persisting outputs has been preserved.\r\n1. All three APIs now use ScriptExecutorUtils.executeRuntimeProgram to execute the compiled program. Previously, JMLC called the Script.execute method directly.\r\n1.  jmlc.Connection.prepareScript now supports compiling a script to use GPU. Note that following #832 the issue noted in #830 has been resolved. \r\n1. A PreparedScript is now statically assigned a GPU context when it is compiled and instatiated. This has potential performance implications because it means that a PreparedScript must be executed on a specific GPU. However, it reduces overhead from creating a GPU context each time a script is executed and unsures that a user cannot compile a script to use GPU and then forget to assign a GPU context when the script is run.\r\n1. Per (3) I have added a unit test which compiles and executes a GPU enabled script in JMLC both with and without pinned data and just asserts that no errors occur. \r\n\r\nI ran `mvn clean verify` on a GPU enabled machine and encountered no exceptions.\r\n\r\n@niketanpansare can you please take a look and let me know what you think? @mboehm7 you may also want to look at this.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T21:40:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-14T16:27:40Z","closed_at":"2018-10-14T16:27:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1c44e06138c5137fb48173ff01cb8f587fc466c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/7b989f8d0023428190cf067332157797f9dbb3ef","head":{"label":"thomas9t:harmonize-apis","ref":"harmonize-apis","sha":"7b989f8d0023428190cf067332157797f9dbb3ef","user":{"login":"thomas9t","id":13305441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA1NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13305441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t","html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139201087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkyMDEwODc=","name":"systemml","full_name":"thomas9t/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomas9t","id":13305441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA1NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13305441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t","html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t/systemml","description":"Mirror

are instances in which it's useful to be able to \"unpin\" variables in JMLC. For example, when executing several different JMLC scripts in the same JVM, I manage model weights externally using a cache of `SoftReferences` to the underlying matrix blocks. Each script gets a slice of time on a CPU during which I want the weights pinned. However, once I am done with a script I would like the weights to be free for garbage collection under memory pressure which is not possible if the script holds a reference to the weight as a reused variable. For the sake of consistency, I have also switched from storing references to pinned data in a `HashMap<String,Data>` to a `LocalVariableMap`.

PR adds support for compilation and execution of GPU enabled scripts in JMLC and harmonizes the pipeline used to compile and execute DML programs across the JMLC, MLContext and DMLScript (command line) APIs. Specifically, the following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. All three APIs now call `ScriptExecutorUtils.compileRuntimeProgram` to compile DML scripts. The original logic in MLContext and JMLC for pinning inputs and persisting outputs has been preserved. \r\n2. All three APIs now use `ScriptExecutorUtils.executeRuntimeProgram` to execute the compiled program. Previously, JMLC called the `Script.execute` method directly.\r\n3. `jmlc.Connection.prepareScript` now supports compiling a script to use GPU. Compiling a GPU enabled program requires modifying static flags in `DMLScript`. Because of this, it is necessary to synchronize compilation when using GPU to ensure only a single program is being compiled at any one time. Otherwise, a script being compiled to use CPU only may incorrectly use GPU enabled opertors. To avoid unnecessary synchronization in the more common case that multiple JMLC scripts are being compiled to use CPU only, we perform a static check at startup to see if the user has included the JCuda dependency in the pipeline. If so, we assume they may want to use GPU and compilation is synchronized. Otherwise, compilation remains unsynchronized. \r\n4. A `PreparedScript` is now statically assigned a GPU context when it is compiled and instatiated. This has potential performance implications because it means that a `PreparedScript` must be executed on a specific GPU. However, it reduces overhead from creating a GPU context each time a script is executed and unsures that a user cannot compile a script to use GPU and then forget to assign a GPU context when the script is run.\r\n\r\n@niketanpansare, @bertholdreinwald, @mboehm7 and @deroneriksson can you please take a look over these changes and let me know if you have
