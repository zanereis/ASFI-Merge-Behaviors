some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning. (045cd8428f)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed our implementations to avoid eagerly initializing loggers during class loading. This can help performance, especially under Android.

some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning. (045cd8428f)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed our implementations to avoid eagerly initializing loggers during class loading. This can help performance, especially under Android.
