for some reason I can't re-open https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8554.  Here's a new PR. \r\n\r\nAs discussed here in a few threads, segmenting tests will go a long way in stabilizing our CI. This PR is a WIP that aims to remove some of the most problematic tests. All tests ignored here either crashed on a P3 instance with the release version (r 0.12) of mxnet from the deep learning AMI, or they took longer to run than a minute. With these tests removed all tests were running in less than 2 minutes on a P3.\r\n\r\nTests are removed with test annotations (aka decorators). Initially I've only used @nightly to indicate a test that would best be run on a nightly basis and @crashing to indicate a crashing test. Once we've decorated tests with annotations we can selectively choose to run them by passing the -a arg to nose (as shown in the new Jenkinsfile).\r\n\r\nAlso made a few changes to speed up GPU builds on CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage (coverage will now be nightly)\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Only these elements are encoded and sent. The elements of the gradient that are near zero can safely be delayed by aggregating them in a residual array. When the updated residual with gradient of next iterations exceed the threshold, these values are sent. Effectively these values are updated at a lower frequency. \r\nOn the receiver's end we decompress the data and use the decompressed weights.\r\nSpecifically in this PR, 2bit quantization has been implemented.\r\n\r\n### Two bit quantization\r\nAny positive value greater than or equal to the threshold is set to one value (say 11), any negative value whose absolute value is greater or equal to the threshold is set to second value (say 10), and others are set to third value (say 0). We need three values to represent data in this fashion and hence two bits. We understand this leads to one bit going waste, but that's an optimization to be done later. The error in quantization is accumulated as residual and carried over to the next iterations. This is added in the next iteration to the gradient before quantizing. \r\nAn example below with thresholds of -2.0 and 2.0. \r\nThis format leads to the reduction of gradient size by 1/16th.\r\n[Quantization at work](https://i.imgur.com/AtBVg92.png)\r\n\r\n### Format of compressed gradient\r\nEac element, represents upto 16 elements in the original array. For the example above, we get an element whose binary representation is \r\n```00 11 00 10 11 00 00 10  0000000000000000```\r\n\r\n### Local kvstore\r\nWhen using local kvstore, gradients compression only happens when using device communication. When gradients are pushed, before summing them up (Reduce), quantization and dequantization happen.\r\nExample: Say we have 4 GPUs, and the gradients are being summed up on GPU0. Each device quantizes gradients, then sends quantized gradient to GPU0, which performs dequantization of this data before merging it with values from other GPUs. Note that here, there is no need to quantize gradients from GPU0 itself, but it is still being done so that there is no bias for the samples which were processed by GPU0. \r\n\r\n### Dist kvstore\r\nWhen the set_gradient_compression method for kvstore is called, each worker sets those compress params and one worker sends these params to all servers. From then on, when before each value is pushed to the server, it is quantized. The server dequantizes the data and stores it as an array of the original size. When values are pulled from the server, it returns an array of the original size. The same happens when each server is handling shards of the data.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe reason I used a dictionary compress_params for the arguments was to ensure uniformity when we extend this to other quantization techniques. This is because each technique might take different type and number of parameters.\r\n#### KVstore\r\n```\r\nkv = mx.kv.create('dist_sync')\r\nkv.set_gradient_compression({'type':'2bit', 'threshold':0.5})\r\n```\r\n#### Module\r\n```\r\nmod = mx.mod.Module(net, compression_params={'type':'2bit', 'threshold':0.5})\r\n ```\r\n#### Gluon Trainer\r\n```\r\ntrainer = gluon.Trainer(net.collect_params(), 'sgd', {'learning_rate': .1}, \r\n                        compression_params={'type':'2bit', 'threshold':0.5})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n**Summary**\r\nShows about 2x speedup when models are large, have fully connected components, for distributed training. On local training, speedup is about 1.2x when there is no P2P communication.\r\n\r\n1.  For MLP with 4 fully connected layers of 1500 size and one fully connected layer of 3000 size\r\n\r\n| input dim | model size | speedup | batch size(on each gpu) |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 300 | 50MB | 1.7x | 256 |\r\n| 300 | 50MB | 1.4x | 1024 |\r\n| 150000 |  | 2x | 64\r\n| 270000 | 900MB | 2x | 128 |\r\n\r\nFor smaller models, the overhead of launching OMP threads is costing a bit, to get around it (if training using GPUs), setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 results in gradient compression is needed.\r\n\r\n2. Shows speedup when communication is expensive. The above speedup was seen on g2.8x machines which have lower network bandwidth than p2.16x machines. p2.16x didn't see as much speedup.\r\n\r\n3. Network types\r\nOn models for imagenet input (input dim: 3,299,299), on g2.8x large, 15 node cluster, used all 4 gpus on each node\r\n\r\n| network type | speedup |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| LSTM, BiLSTM | about 1.25-1.5x |\r\n| VGG11 | 1.8x |\r\n| MLP, Alexnet | 2x |\r\n\r\n4. Accuracy \r\nLSTM on PennTreeBank with 200dim 2 layers\r\n![LSTM on Penntree bank](https://i.imgur.com/bzbxrlF.png)\r\n\r\nMNIST on MLP \r\n![MNIST on MLP](https://imgur.com/PVzGhoj.png)\r\n\r\nCIFAR with resnet\r\n![Cifar with resnet](https://i.imgur.com/BBkfmWE.png)\r\n\r\nAccuracy starts off slow, but the network converges to similar accuracy.\r\nAccuracies at a few epochs\r\nepoch 101 : \r\n2bit: 0.80645, none: 0.83572, difference: 0.029\r\nepoch153\r\n2bit: 0.841, none: 0.851, difference: 0.0108\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIFAR resnet with pretraining\r\n![pretrained resnet](https://i.imgur.com/w5sEGV5.png)\r\n\r\nPre-training without gradient compression for some time(2 epochs), leads to better convergence\r\nWe see that in this case, we start off much closer and reaches similar accuracies earlier. In general, the graphs are much closer. Let's look at epoch 33, Earlier, without pretraining, 2bit compression had an accuracy degradation of 0.154 when compared to the case without gradient compression. Now, when both models start with a pretrained network which didn't use gradient compression, it has a degradation of only 0.04. \r\n\r\n\r\nReference (although compressed representation is different

Description ##\r\nAll builds are timing out in the build queue since the number of ubuntu slaves is less. \r\nIdeally this timeout is meant for the build time on the executor, but somehow it even times out while a task waits in the queue. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Changed Timeout to 1440 minutes = 24hrs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis is temporary until we move to a new CI.\r\nmbaijal to monitor if this change helps.

be used, given # of iterations required and # threads to perform the job.\r\n\r\nCorrect decision accuracy is tested in gtest OMP_TUNING test suite by comparing with OMP, without OMP, and Auto times.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* AWS c4.8xlarge:\r\n  Success rate for type float: 0.90278\r\n  Success rate for type double: 0.88889\r\n  Success rate for type mshadow::half::half_t: 0.83333\r\n  Success rate for type unsigned char: 0.86111\r\n  Success rate for type int: 0.95833\r\n  Success rate for type long: 0.88889\r\n\r\n* desktop: 12-core (6 real CPU cores + hyperthreading)\r\n  Success rate for type float: 0.79167\r\n  Success rate for type double: 0.75000\r\n  Success rate for type unsigned char: 0.72222\r\n  Success rate for type int: 0.94444\r\n  Success rate for type long:

for using the lapack functionalities in MKL.\r\n \r\n- This is a backward compatible change that does not alter any existing behaviour except that linalg-operators will automatically use MKL-blas  whenever USE_BLAS=mkl is set (todays behaviour is  that the operators do not work at all in this case)\r\n\r\n- It also allows a user that has a complete installation of MKL (not only MKL2017/MKL_ML) to use MKL's lapack routines. This would still require some editing of configs and mshadows makefiles (as the configuration is currently not setup for using the whole MKL), but at least it is now doable.\r\n\r\n- In a second step, the make-system should be cleaned w.r.t. MKL-build, but  I would like to separate it from the C++ changes.

Description ##\r\n- Re-implemented slice operator using Kernel::Launch\r\n- Added support for arbitrary values of `step` along with `begin` and `end`, i.e. `slice(data, begin, end, step)`, where `step` is an optional parameter.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The kernel implementation is based upon the parallelization approach of slice operator in mshadow with additional support for arbitrary value of `step`.\r\n- This operator will be used in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8246 to support slicing `NDArray` with `step!=1`. Currently, it uses `gather_nd` op to realize that functionality, which has heavy overhead of making index `NDArray` from slices.\r\n- Mini-benchmark `slice_v1` (**mshadow version**) and `slice` (**Kernel::Launch version**).\r\n\r\n**Hardware**\r\np2.xlarge (4 omp threads)\r\n\r\n**Commit**\r\n[ba9de66](https://github.com/reminisce/mxnet/commit/ba9de669a752f232dcb21b0c11f9a4f91533af23)\r\n\r\n**GPU build**\r\nmx.nd.slice_v1: 10000 repeats costs 0.561281

Description ##\r\nAs discussed here in a few threads, segmenting tests will go a long way in stabilizing our CI.  This PR is a WIP that aims to remove some of the most problematic tests.  All tests ignored here either crashed on a P3 instance with the release version (r 0.12) of mxnet from the deep learning AMI, or they took longer to run than a minute.  With these tests removed all tests were running in less than 2 minutes on a P3.\r\n\r\nTests are removed with test annotations (aka decorators).  Initially I've only used ```@nightly``` to indicate a test that would best be run on a nightly basis and ```@crashing``` to indicate a crashing test.  I'd propose we open issues for all crashing tests, assign owners and leave the tests ignored for the time being in the test suite.  I'd also like to discuss what the correct set of test annotations should be.  Should we consider ```@cuda_test```, ```@high_mem``` or ```@http_required``` test annotations for example?  Once we've decorated tests with annotations we can selectively choose to run them by passing the -a arg to nose (as shown in the new Jenkinsfile).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)  (not run)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR) (WIP)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage (removes tests)\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Set some defaults for dynamic and recursion unless environment variables are set.\r\n\r\nShould be last major PR before tuning PR.\r\n\r\nNo performance degradation was seen when enabling OMP with one or two cores reserved (depending on the number of available cores).  Generally, OMP operations aren't occurring in parallel to GPU operations.  Values can be adjusted if use-cases can be found.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding

Description ##\r\nThe previous ImageDetIter validated a bounding box with two points only (left-top and right-bottom points). Many other datasets provides a bounding box label with four points (left-top, left-bottom, right-top, right-bottom). \r\n\r\nThe new validating process of the bounding box in the ImageDetIter looks at the number of points given and validate appropriately. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces a new simple level of control over unittest random seeds while providing inter-test random number generator (RNG) isolation. This PR is an improved replacement to the pending PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8313.  The improvements over that PR are:\r\n\r\n1. A unittest that fails via an exception will have its seed reported in the test log.  Reproducing the failure with the same-seeded data is simple and immediate.\r\n2. The mx.random seeds are also set (identically to np.random) giving deterministic behavior and test isolation for mxnet cpu and gpu RNG's.\r\n3. A unittest failure via a core-dump can also be reproduced after the module test is re-run with debugging enabled.\r\n\r\nTo provide this functionality, a custom decorator \"@with_seed()\" was created.  This was considered more powerful than the nosetests \"@with_setup()\" facility, and less disruptive than changing all tests to become methods of a nosetests test class.  The proposed new approach is demonstrated on a simple \"test_module.py\" test file of three tests. Assuming that the second test needs a set seed for robustness, the file might currently appear as:\r\n```\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    np.random.seed(1234)\r\n    <op2 test>\r\n\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\nEven though test_op3() is OK with nondeterministic data, it will have only a single dataset because it is run after test_op2, which sets the seed. Also, if test_op1() were to fail, there would be no way to reproduce the failure, except for running the test individually to produce a new and hopefully similar failure.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed approach, the test file becomes:\r\n```\r\nfrom common import *\r\n\r\n@with_seed()\r\ndef test_op1():\r\n    <op1 test>\r\n\r\n@with_seed(1234)\r\ndef test_op2():\r\n    <op2 test>\r\n\r\n@with_seed()\r\ndef test_op3():\r\n    <op3 test>\r\n```\r\nBy importing unittests/common.py, the seeds of the numpy and mxnet RNGs are set initially to a random \"module seed\" that is output to the log file.  The initial RNGs can be thought of as module-level RNGs that are isolated from the individual tests and that provide the string of  \"test seeds\" that determine the behavior of each test's RNGs. The \"@with_seed()\" test function decorator requests a test seed from the module RNG, sets the numpy and mxnet seeds appropriately and runs the test.  Should the test fail, the seed for that test is output to the log file.  Pass or fail, the decorator reinstates the module RNG state before the next test's decorator is executed, effectively isolating the tests.  Debugging a failing test_op3 in the example would proceed as follows:\r\n```\r\n$ nosetests --verbose -s test_module.py\r\n[INFO] Setting module np/mx random seeds, use MXNET_MODULE_SEED=3444154063 to reproduce.\r\ntest_module.test_op1 ... ok\r\ntest_module.test_op2 ... [INFO] Setting test np/mx random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=1234 to reproduce.\r\nok\r\ntest_module.test_op3 ... [INFO] Setting test np/mx random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 to reproduce.\r\nFAIL\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_module.test_op3\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n<stack trace appears here>\r\n-------------------- >> begin captured logging << --------------------\r\ncommon: INFO: Setting test np/mx random seeds, use MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 to reproduce.\r\n--------------------- >> end captured logging << ---------------------\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 3 tests in 1.354s\r\nFAILED (failures=1)\r\n```\r\nBecause test_op3 failed, its seed appeared in the log file.  Also, the test_op2 seed was displayed as a reminder that that test needs more work before it is robust enough for random data.  The command to reproduce the problem is produced simply by cutting and pasting from the log:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603 nostests --verbose -s test_module.py:test_op3\r\n```\r\nIf test_op3 instead dumped core, the test seed would not be initially apparent.  Assuming the core-dump is repeatable based on the data, the module would first be re-run with the command:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_MODULE_SEED=3444154063 nostests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s test_module.py\r\n```\r\nThe log would now include the test seeds for all tests *before* they are run, so the test could then be run in isolation as before with MXNET_TEST_SEED=2096230603.\r\n\r\nLet's assume that test_op3 was altered by increasing a tolerance.  How robust is the test now?  This can be explored by repeating the test many times as in:\r\n```\r\n$ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nostests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s test_module.py:test_op3\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR adds the @with_seed() decorator for all tests in modules that use random numbers.  Also, it includes many specific test robustness fixes that were exposed once this new methodology was adopted internally by the author.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] Passed
