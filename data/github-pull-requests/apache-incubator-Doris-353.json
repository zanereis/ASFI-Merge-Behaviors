Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn the previous broker load, multiple OlapTableSinks would send data to the same LoadChannel,\r\nand because of the lock granularity problem, LoadChannel could only process these requests serially,\r\nwhich made it impossible to make full use of cluster resources.\r\n\r\nThis CL modifies the related locks so that LoadChannel can process these requests in parallel.\r\n\r\nIn the test, with a size of 20G, the load speed of 334 million rows of data in 3 nodes has been\r\nincreased from 9min to 5min, and after enabling 2 concurrency, it can be increased

Proposed changes\r\nThis PR support following functions:\r\n1. Support content properties in backup stmt. It means user can backup only metadata or meta+data which use content [METADATA_ONLY| ALL]attribute to distinguish.\r\n2. Support exclude some tables in backup and restore stmt. This means that some very large and unimportant tables can be excluded when the entire database is backed up.\r\n3. Support backup and restore whole database instead of declaring each table name in the backup and restore statement.\r\n\r\nThe backup and restore api has changed as following:\r\n```\r\nBACKUP SNAPSHOT [db_name].{snapshot_name}\r\nTO 'repo_name'\r\n[ON|EXCLUDE (\r\n    'table_name' [partition (p1,...)]\r\n)]\r\n[properties (\r\n    \"content\" = \"metadata_only|all\"\r\n)]\r\n\r\nRESTORE SNAPSHOT [db_name].{snapshot_name}\r\nTO 'repo_name'\r\n[EXCLUDE|ON (\r\n    'table_name' [partition (p1,...)]\r\n)]\r\n[properties (\r\n)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have created an issue on (Fix #5298 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [TODO] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nI will continue to update the documentation, please review my code first.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-28T11:10:52Z","updated_at":"2021-01-31T16:12:36Z","closed_at":"2021-01-31T16:12:36Z","merged_at":"2021-01-31T16:12:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb7ba00ccf91e2a66b1f8932d134a06b63a73263","assignee":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1702420173,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzAyNDIwMTcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/api-change","name":"kind/api-change","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Support backup and restore view and odbc table. The syntax is the same as the backup and restore table.\r\n2. If the table associated with the view does not exist in the snapshot,\r\n   the view can still be backed up successfully, but the TableNotFound exception will be thrown when querying the view.\r\n3. If the odbc table associated with the odbc resource, the odbc resource will be backuped and restored together.\r\n4. If the same view, odbc table and resource already exists in the database, it will compare whether the metadata of snapshot is consistent.\r\n   If it is inconsistent, the restoration will fail.\r\n4. This pr also modified the json format of the backup information.\r\n   A `new_backup_objects` object is added to the root node to store backup meta-information other than olap table,\r\n   such as views and external tables.\r\n   ```\r\n   {\r\n       \"backup_objects\": {},\r\n       \"new_backup_objects\": {\r\n           \"view\": [\r\n               {\"name\": \"view1\", \"id\": \"10001\"}\r\n           ],\r\n           \"odbc_table\": [\r\n               {\"name\":\"xxx\", xxx}\r\n           ]\r\n           \"odbc_resources\": [\r\n               {\"name\": \"bj_oracle\"}\r\n           ]\r\n       }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n5. This pr changes the serialization and deserialization method of backup information\r\n   from manual construction to automatic analysis by Gson tools.\r\n\r\nChange-Id: I216469bf2a6484177185d8354dcca2dc19f653f3\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSimilar to the parallel_fragment_exec_instance_num parameter,\r\nit allows the user to set the parallelism of the load execution plan\r\non a single node when the broker load

it cannot significantly improve the load speed for the time being.\r\nThe speed increase will be completed in subsequent code submissions.\r\nDocuments will also be added in subsequent submissions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also update the FE meta version.\r\n\r\n#5281\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Code refactor

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAt present, the application of vlog in the code is quite confusing.

VLOG(number) format does not have a unified specification, so this pr standardizes the use of VLOG\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Schema hash is useless long time ago\r\n    Currently, schema hash can only be generated as a random integer, no need to calculated\r\n    from real schema.\r\n\r\n2. The CRC32 algo is not enough to generate the table' signature.\r\n    Table's signature is used to determine whether the tables have the same schema.\r\n    And current CRC32 algo may return same signature even if table's schema are different.\r\n\r\n    So I change it to calculate the md5 of a signature string assambled by schema info of a table.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn version 0.13, we support a more efficient compaction logic. \r\nThis logic will maintain multiple version paths of the tablet.\r\nThis can avoid -230 errors and can also support incremental clone.\r\n\r\nBut the previous incremental clone uses the incremental rowset meta recorded in `incr_rs_meta`.\r\nAt present, the incremental rowset meta recorded in `incr_rs_meta` and the records\r\nin `stale_rs_meta` are duplicated, and the current clone logic does not adapt to the\r\nnew multi-version path, resulting in many cases not triggering incremental clone.\r\n\r\nThis CL mainly modified:\r\n\r\n1. Removed `incr_rs_meta` metadata\r\n2. Modified the clone logic. When the clone is incremented, it will try to read the rowset in `stale_rs_meta`.\r\n3. Delete a lot of code that was previously used for version compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-13T07:55:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-06T14:04:49Z","closed_at":"2021-02-06T14:04:49Z","merged_at":"2021-02-06T14:04:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6e2c3e3f12508756d746ed97b63bc2792ae7af3","assignee":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Problem analysis\r\nThe essence of the problem is behavior of negative zero (- 0.0) in comparison with positive zero (+ 0.0).\r\nCurrently in GroupBy and HashPartition, -0.0 is not equal to 0.0 (result of Hash function), so the -0.0 and 0.0 are divided into 2 partitions.\r\n\r\nIn row_number analytic function, for the sorted data, a new partition will be opened when the values ​​​​of the upper and lower rows are not equal. But in C++ the comparison 0.0 == -0.0 is true, so 0.0 and -0.0 are divided into the same partition for row_number.\r\n\r\n(Floating point arithmetic in C++ is often IEEE-754. This norm defines two different representations for the value zero: positive zero and negative zero. It is also defined that those two representations must compare equals. Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45795397)\r\n\r\n## Fix method\r\n1. (Deprecated) Modifies the eq comparison of two Doubles in BinaryPredicate, and returns -0.0 == 0.0 as false when both sides of expr are SlotRef.\r\nProblems:\r\n  (1) When order by is still considered equal to 0.0 and -0.0, the order of 0.0 and -0.0 in the result is random\r\n  (2) The reason for restricting both sides of BinaryPredicate to be SlotRef is that the constant cannot be defined as -0.0. For example, the expression of `where k1 = -0.0` in SQL in actual calculation is `where k1 = 0.0`.\r\n\r\n2. Modify the Hash function in `hash_util.hpp`, when data is negative zero, rewrite it to 0.0, which will be used in `DataStreamSender::send HashPartition` and `GroupBy`, because the original value of data is covered, so -0.0 in the original data after Hash will be changed to 0.0.\r\n\r\nOur goal is that -0.0 will not appear in Doris, and all will be replaced with 0.0. Therefore, you need to modify the Broker Load in the future, and change -0.0 to 0.0 when importing. Mysql and SparkSQL are currently converted to 0.0 when Load -0.0 to Double column. But there is a situation that may not be avoided, that is, `select round(-0.2,0);`, the returned `-0.0` is meaningful, refer to
