for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen Initializing factors in ALS, we should use `mapPartitions` instead of current `map`, so we can preserve existing partition of the RDD of `InBlock`. The RDD of `InBlock` is already partitioned by src block id. We don't change the partition when initializing factors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch can reduce unnecessary shuffle after initializing factors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt should not change existing tests. It should pass added test that verifies shuffle dependency of factor RDDs.","created_at":"2019-08-30T23:32:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:52Z","closed_at":"2019-09-02T02:50:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e10b82f25e25c69456b5e15b17c50431b1c2ee58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60b3d5db99f313e209d552cd370b42841b09e878","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-als-partition","ref":"fix-als-partition","sha":"60b3d5db99f313e209d552cd370b42841b09e878","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25500\r\n\r\nResolves [SPARK-28778: Shuffle jobs fail due to incorrect advertised address when running in a virtual network on Mesos](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28778).\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug which occurs when shuffle jobs are launched by Mesos in a virtual network. Mesos scheduler sets executor `--hostname` parameter to `0.0.0.0` in the case when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided. This makes executors use `0.0.0.0` as their advertised address and, in the presence of shuffle, executors fail to fetch shuffle blocks from each other using `0.0.0.0` as the origin. When a virtual network is used the hostname or IP address is not known upfront and assigned to a container at its start time so the executor process needs to advertise the correct dynamically assigned address to be reachable by other executors.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- added a fallback to `Utils.localHostName()` in Spark Executors when `--hostname` is not provided\r\n- removed setting executor address to `0.0.0.0` from Mesos scheduler\r\n- refactored the code related to building executor command in Mesos scheduler\r\n- added network configuration support to Docker containerizer\r\n- added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe bug described above prevents Mesos users from running any jobs which involve shuffle due to the inability of executors to fetch shuffle blocks because of incorrect advertised address when virtual network is used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- added unit test to `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite` which verifies the absence of `--hostname` parameter  when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided and its presence otherwise\r\n- added unit test to `MesosSchedulerBackendUtilSuite` which verifies that `MesosSchedulerBackendUtil.buildContainerInfo` sets network-related properties for Docker containerizer\r\n- unit tests from this repo\r\n- integration tests from [DCOS Spark repo](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build), more specifically - [test_spark_cni.py](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/test_spark_cni.py) which runs a specific [shuffle job](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/jobs/scala/src/main/scala/ShuffleApp.scala) and verifies its successful completion, Mesos task network configuration, and IP addresses for both Mesos and Docker

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25500\r\n\r\nResolves [SPARK-28778: Shuffle jobs fail due to incorrect advertised address when running in a virtual network on Mesos](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28778).\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug which occurs when shuffle jobs are launched by Mesos in a virtual network. Mesos scheduler sets executor `--hostname` parameter to `0.0.0.0` in the case when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided. This makes executors use `0.0.0.0` as their advertised address and, in the presence of shuffle, executors fail to fetch shuffle blocks from each other using `0.0.0.0` as the origin. When a virtual network is used the hostname or IP address is not known upfront and assigned to a container at its start time so the executor process needs to advertise the correct dynamically assigned address to be reachable by other executors.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- added a fallback to `Utils.localHostName()` in Spark Executors when `--hostname` is not provided\r\n- removed setting executor address to `0.0.0.0` from Mesos scheduler\r\n- refactored the code related to building executor command in Mesos scheduler\r\n- added network configuration support to Docker containerizer\r\n- added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe bug described above prevents Mesos users from running any jobs which involve shuffle due to the inability of executors to fetch shuffle blocks because of incorrect advertised address when virtual network is used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- added unit test to `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite` which verifies the absence of `--hostname` parameter  when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided and its presence otherwise\r\n- added unit test to `MesosSchedulerBackendUtilSuite` which verifies that `MesosSchedulerBackendUtil.buildContainerInfo` sets network-related properties for Docker containerizer\r\n- unit tests from this repo\r\n- integration tests from [DCOS Spark repo](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build), more specifically - [test_spark_cni.py](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/test_spark_cni.py) which runs a specific [shuffle job](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/jobs/scala/src/main/scala/ShuffleApp.scala) and verifies its successful completion, Mesos task network configuration, and IP addresses for both Mesos and Docker

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLog levels in Executor.scala are changed from DEBUG to INFO. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLogging level DEBUG is too low here. These messages are simple acknowledgement for successful loading and initialization of plugins. So its better to keep them in INFO level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt the moment there are 3 places where communication protocol with Kafka cluster has to be set when delegation token used:\r\n* On delegation token\r\n* On source\r\n* On sink\r\n\r\nMost of the time users are using the same protocol on all these places (within one Kafka cluster). It would be better to declare it in one place (delegation token side) and Kafka sources/sinks can take this config over.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've I've modified the code in a way that Kafka sources/sinks are taking over delegation token side `security.protocol` configuration when the token and the source/sink matches in `bootstrap.servers` configuration. This default configuration can be overwritten on each source/sink independently by using `kafka.security.protocol` configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe actual configuration's default behavior represents the minority of the use-cases and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, with this change users need to provide less configuration parameters by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-30T12:05:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T22:42:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T22:42:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3778e1a258aadc65401def2f51e14a774c64f39b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

<system-out/>\r\n    <system-err/>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRoot cause seems a bug in SBT - it truncates the test name based on the last dot.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2949\r\nhttps://github.com/sbt/sbt/blob/v0.13.18/testing/src/main/scala/sbt/JUnitXmlTestsListener.scala#L71-L79\r\n\r\nI tried to find a better way but couldn't find. Therefore, this PR proposes a workaround by appending the test file name into the assert log:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  [info] - inner-join.sql *** FAILED *** (4 seconds, 306 milliseconds)\r\n+ [info]   inner-join.sql\r\n  [info]   Expected \"1\ta\r\n  [info]   1\ta\r\n  [info]   1\tb\r\n  [info]   1[]\", but got \"1\ta\r\n  [info]   1\ta\r\n  [info]   1\tb\r\n  [info]   1[\tb]\" Result did not match for query #6\r\n  [info]   SELECT tb.* FROM ta INNER JOIN tb ON ta.a = tb.a AND ta.tag = tb.tag (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:377)\r\n  [info]   org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException:\r\n  [info]   at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:528)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will at least prevent us to search full logs to identify which test file is failed by clicking filed test.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not fully fix the issue but only fix the logs on its failed tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo debug Jenkins logs easier. Otherwise, we should open full logs and search which test was failed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt will print out the file name of failed tests in Jenkins' test reports.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested but Jenkins tests are required in this PR.\r\n\r\nNow it at least shows which file it is:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-08-30 at 10 16 32

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bugs in test code itself, FsHistoryProviderSuite. \r\n\r\n1. When creating log file via `newLogFile`, codec is ignored, leading to wrong file name. (No one tends to create test for test code, as well as the bug doesn't affect existing tests indeed, so not easy to catch.)\r\n2. When writing events to log file via `writeFile`, metadata (in case of new format) gets written to file regardless of its codec, and the content is overwritten by another stream, hence no information for Spark version is available. It affects existing test, hence we have wrong expected value to workaround the bug.\r\n\r\nThis patch also removes redundant parameter `isNewFormat` in `writeFile`, as according to review comment, Spark no longer supports old format.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExplained in above section why they're bugs, though they only reside in test-code. (Please note that the bug didn't come from non-test side of code.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified existing UTs, as well as read event log file in console to see metadata is not overwritten by other contents.","created_at":"2019-08-30T07:25:49Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T18:06:52Z","closed_at":"2019-09-04T16:41:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7697681dba4a9543d0a815eb21f9959f34f010f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Root Cause:**\r\nWhen a dataframe is created using select statement (using **spark.sql.parser.quotedRegexColumnNames=true**) dataframe fill is called- the _fillCol_ in DataFrameNaFunctions, **``(backtick)** are added  explicitly to the **columnNames**, the column name is misunderstood to be a regex and it is set as an unresolvedregex, which makes the coalesce resolving to fail.\r\n\r\n_Observation_\r\nWhen we create the dataframe from the select statement using a regex, valid columns names are returned after applying the filter(regex). So adding _backticks_ to column name in this flow was not needed. To check the impact, select statement with regex were used, there was no impact while executing without the _backticks_.\r\n\r\n**After Fix**\r\nWhile passing the columnname to the dataframe column method, **``(backtick)** are not added, as the value that is received is not a regular expression, but a valid column name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy doing this change column name is not considered as regex and the proper Column function is derived.\r\nAnd does not fail to resolve the expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by adding UT cases. And testing in spark shell using various select statement .(with and without regex)\r\n\r\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR supports UPDATE in the parser and add the corresponding logical plan. The SQL syntax is a standard UPDATE statement:\r\n```\r\nUPDATE tableName tableAlias SET colName=value [, colName=value]+ WHERE predicate?\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith this change, we can start to implement UPDATE in builtin sources and think about how to design the update API in DS v2. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test cases added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-30T02:27:51Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T00:50:03Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T11:26:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8118c3be30f0b2d331078db7aaa610f23fcc9127","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3732a18e3012e0dccc28663f9a37ca570e8b13d1","head":{"label":"xianyinxin:SPARK-28892","ref":"SPARK-28892","sha":"3732a18e3012e0dccc28663f9a37ca570e8b13d1","user":{"login":"xianyinxin","id":15028683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182274989,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODIyNzQ5ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"xianyinxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xianyinxin","id":15028683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin","html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xianyinxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xianyinxin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `-Pyarn -Pmesos -Pkubernetes -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Phadoop-3.2 -Phadoop-cloud` profiles to GitHub workflow conf.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we build with JDK8 and test with JDK8/11 in Jenkins.\r\nAnd, we use GitHub Workflow for JDK8/JDK11 building test.\r\nTo test JDK11 fully, we need to enable `hive` and `hadoop-3.2` profiles for `Hive 2.3.6` and `Hadoop 3.2`. Also, this PR adds all resource manager modules, too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. In addition, Jenkins workload will be the same because this is specific to GitHub workflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSee the GitHub workflow run

disappear.\r\n\r\nThere are basically 2 ways to handle this situation:\r\n* Add default value for `SparkEnv` in `KafkaReductionUtil`\r\n* Add `SparkEnv` to all such tests => I think it would be overkill and would just increase number of lines without real value\r\n\r\nConsidering this I've chosen the first approach.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCouple of tests are throwing exceptions even if no real problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew + additional unit

the newly added shuffle block fetching protocol in #24565, we can keep this work by extending the FetchShuffleBlocks message.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this patch, we achieve the indeterminate shuffle rerun by reusing the task attempt id(unique id within an application) in shuffle id, so that each shuffle write attempt has a different file name. For the indeterministic stage, when the stage resubmits, we'll clear all existing map status and rerun all partitions. \r\n\r\nAll changes are summarized as follows:\r\n- Change the mapId to mapTaskAttemptId in shuffle related id.\r\n- Record the mapTaskAttemptId in MapStatus.\r\n- Still keep mapId in ShuffleFetcherIterator for fetch failed scenario.\r\n- Add the determinate flag in Stage and use it in DAGScheduler and the cleaning work for the intermediate stage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a follow-up work for #22112's future improvment[1]: `Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail.`\r\n\r\nSpark will rerun a finished shuffle write stage while meeting fetch failures, currently, the rerun shuffle map stage will only resubmit the task for missing partitions and reuse the output of other partitions. This logic is fine in most scenarios, but for indeterministic operations(like repartition), multiple shuffle write attempts may write different data, only rerun the missing partition will lead a correctness bug. So for the shuffle map stage of indeterministic operations, we need to support rolling back the shuffle map stage and re-generate the shuffle files. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after this PR, the indeterminate stage rerun will be accepted by rerunning the whole stage. The original behavior is aborting the stage and fail the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- UT: Add UT for all changing code and newly added function.\r\n- Manual Test: Also providing a manual test to verify the effect.\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval determinateStage0 = sc.parallelize(0 until 1000 * 1000 * 100, 10)\r\nval indeterminateStage1 = determinateStage0.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage2 = indeterminateStage1.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage3 = indeterminateStage2.repartition(100)\r\nval indeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage3.repartition(300)\r\nval fetchFailIndeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage4.map { x =>\r\nif (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId == 190 && \r\n  TaskContext.get.stageAttemptNumber == 0) {\r\n  throw new Exception(\"pkill -f -n java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nval indeterminateStage5 = fetchFailIndeterminateStage4.repartition(200)\r\nval finalStage6 = indeterminateStage5.repartition(100).collect().distinct.length\r\n``` \r\nIt's a simple job with multi indeterminate stage, it will get a wrong answer while using old Spark version like 2.2/2.3, and will be killed after #22112. With this fix, the job can retry all indeterminate stage as below screenshot and get the right result.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4833765/63948434-3477de00-caab-11e9-9ed1-75abfe6d16bd.png)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-29T14:23:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T06:49:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T08:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ead0538646d191f5aafc222ef7516d61c3fd176","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisallow conversions between `timestamp` type and `long` type in table insertion with ANSI store assignment policy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25581, timestamp type is allowed to be converted to long type, since timestamp type is represented by long type internally, and both legacy mode and strict mode allows the conversion.\r\n\r\nAfter reconsideration, I think we should disallow it. As per ANSI SQL section \"4.4.2 Characteristics of numbers\":\r\n> A number is assignable only to sites of numeric type.\r\n\r\nIn PostgreSQL, the conversion between timestamp and long is also disallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nConversion between timestamp and long is disallowed in table insertion with ANSI store assignment policy.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a new lock mechanism `KeyLock` to lock  with a given key. Also use this new lock in `TorrentBroadcast` to avoid blocking tasks from fetching different broadcast values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`TorrentBroadcast.readObject` uses a global lock so only one task can be fetching the blocks at the same time. This is not optimal if we are running multiple stages concurrently because they should be able to independently fetch their own blocks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-28T18:00:07Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T21:12:30Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T21:09:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6dd2b1da1777eb1e7d8e922d0aaff98f68608b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent Spark Thirft Server can't support cancel SQL job,  when we use Hue to query throgh Spark Thrift Server, when we run a sql and then click cancel button to cancel this sql, we will it won't work in backend and in the spark JDBC UI tab, we can see the SQL's status is always COMPILED, then the duration of SQL is always increasing, this may make people confused.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/63869830-60338f00-c9eb-11e9-8776-cee965adcb0a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf sql status can't reflect sql's true status, it will make user confused.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSparkthriftServer's UI tab will show SQL's status in CANCELED when

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChanges in this pull request will support users to define `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` and `spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName` at the same time. When both of them are defined, Spark will take precedence over the config map to be mounted on the driver pod. This enables the spark client process to communicate any Hadoop cluster if it needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe *BasicDriverFeatureStep* for Spark on Kubernetes will upload the files/jars specified by --files/–jars to a Hadoop compatible file system configured by spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path. While using HADOOP_CONF_DIR, the spark-submit process can recognize the file system, but when using spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName which only will be mount on the Pods not applied back to our client process. \r\n \r\n```scala\r\n Kent@KentsMacBookPro  ~/Documents/spark-on-k8s/spark-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-2.7.3  bin/spark-submit --conf

JUnit XML reports, in particular, about `classname` and `name` in `testcase` (e.g., the first dot is package name, etc.). (See for instance https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29471614/why-is-jenkins-improperly-parsing-my-junit-report).\r\n\r\nThis problem happens to all the tests written in Spark so we better have to avoid dot in test names; otherwise, the test title seems truncated in Jenkins test report.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo debug Jenkins logs easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt store the test name correctly in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new config option `spark.sql.driver.maxUncompressedResultSize` (defaulting to empty which preserves the same behavior as before this PR).\r\nIf this config option is present then the size of the uncompressed, decoded result of SQL actions (e.g., collect) will be limited to its value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe main problem with the existing `spark.driver.maxResultSize` is that it only enforces the size of the compressed data (of the compressed byte rdd). The actual uncompressed size can be much larger. Thus, `spark.driver.maxResultSize` is no good mechanism for protecting the driver against OOMs when using spark sql.\r\n\r\nAdding this new config option provides an additional, better way for protecting the driver against OOMs during collects.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a new unit test in `SparkPlanSuite.scala`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-28T00:33:41Z","updated_at":"2020-04-05T00:09:33Z","closed_at":"2020-04-05T00:09:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b692a1c7583315ac2ea6d2a01d8ceb4c163d02a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80dd7dfc206b5375d58cff1171a7f8a1c001e46d","head":{"label":"dvogelbacher:dv/SPARK-28613","ref":"dv/SPARK-28613","sha":"80dd7dfc206b5375d58cff1171a7f8a1c001e46d","user":{"login":"dvogelbacher","id":37212524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjEyNTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37212524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher","html_url":"https://github.com/dvogelbacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvogelbacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"90b10b4f7a54caaf0962424a111fddbd42b107b1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch implements dynamic partition pruning by adding a dynamic-partition-pruning filter if there is a partitioned table and a filter on the dimension table. The filter is then planned using a heuristic approach:\r\n1. As a broadcast relation if it is a broadcast hash join. The broadcast relation will then be transformed into a reused broadcast exchange by the `ReuseExchange` rule; or\r\n2. As a subquery duplicate if the estimated benefit of partition table scan being saved is greater than the estimated cost of the extra scan of the duplicated subquery; otherwise\r\n3. As a bypassed condition (`true`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an important performance feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n- Testing DPP by enabling / disabling the reuse broadcast results feature and / or the subquery duplication feature.\r\n- Testing DPP with reused broadcast results.\r\n- Testing the key iterators on different HashedRelation types.\r\n- Testing the packing and unpacking of the broadcast keys in a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24834 with minimised changes, and the tests added at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25594.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24834 was not backported before because basically it targeted a better exception by propagating the exception from JVM.\r\n\r\nHowever, actually this PR fixed another problem accidentally (see  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25594 and [SPARK-28881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28881)). This regression seems introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21546.\r\n\r\nRoot cause is that, seems \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/23bed0d3c08e03085d3f0c3a7d457eedd30bd67f/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L3370-L3384\r\n\r\n`runJob` with `resultHandler` seems able to write partial output.\r\n\r\nJVM throws an exception but, since the JVM exception is not propagated into Python process, Python process doesn't know if the exception is thrown or not from JVM (it just closes the socket), which results as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=1m\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\",True)\r\nspark.range(10000000).toPandas()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nEmpty DataFrame\r\nColumns: [id]\r\nIndex: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, it lets Python process catches exceptions from JVM.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt returns incorrect data. And potentially it returns partial results when an exception happens in JVM sides. This is a regression. The codes work fine in Spark 2.3.3.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=1m\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\",True)\r\nspark.range(10000000).toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded two new configuration items:\r\nspark.kubernetes.executor.node.selector\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.node.selector\r\n\r\nWhich mimic the behaviour of spark.kubernetes.node.selector but specifically for executors and nodes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo allow Kubernetes users to deploy driver and executor pods to different nodes.\r\nThis is especially important for AWS users who want to run executors on Spot instances.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove unnecessary physical projection added to ensure rows are `UnsafeRow` when the DSv2 scan is columnar. This is not needed because conversions are automatically added to convert from columnar operators to `UnsafeRow` when the next operator does not support columnar execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRemoves an extra projection and copy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `spark.sql.statistics.fallBackToHdfs` not support Hive partitioned tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is incorrect for external partitions and it is expensive to support partitioned table with external partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen Task retry happens with Kafka source then it's not known whether the consumer is the issue so the old consumer removed from cache and new consumer created. The feature works fine but not covered with tests.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added such test for DStreams + Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo such tests are there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + new unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-26T12:11:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T20:12:27Z","closed_at":"2019-08-26T20:12:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"341c8e71066d99e3464bd8c0d8da86e68ff1d747","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6602ece506469bc706f74d8b0e4eda4dc4d229b","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-28875","ref":"SPARK-28875","sha":"d6602ece506469bc706f74d8b0e4eda4dc4d229b","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Introduce ANSI store assignment policy for table insertion. \r\nWith ANSI policy, Spark performs the type coercion of table insertion as per ANSI SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn Spark version 2.4 and earlier, when inserting into a table, Spark will cast the data type of input query to the data type of target table by coercion. This can be super confusing, e.g. users make a mistake and write string values to an int column.\r\n\r\nIn data source V2, by default, only upcasting is allowed when inserting data into a table. E.g. int -> long and int -> string are allowed, while decimal -> double or long -> int are not allowed. The rules of UpCast was originally created for Dataset type coercion. They are quite strict and different from the behavior of all existing popular DBMS. This is breaking change. It is possible that existing queries are broken after 3.0 releases.\r\n\r\nFollowing ANSI SQL standard makes Spark consistent with the table insertion behaviors of popular DBMS like PostgreSQL/Oracle/Mysql.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nA new optional mode for table insertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-26T11:38:14Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T14:13:37Z","closed_at":"2019-08-27T14:13:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5222a948348c1c6267d76244fa918eda00c0d96a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/af0f7390e61455682cb5089f8e8dd3c0e60d32b1","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:ANSImode","ref":"ANSImode","sha":"af0f7390e61455682cb5089f8e8dd3c0e60d32b1","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the replay performance in HistoryServer by periodically checkpoint InMemoryStore in an in-completed application and achieve incremental replay.The main idea\r\nis, for an in-completed application, we periodically (normally every N events num) checkpoint InMemoryStore with processed events num(X) into event log dir. And in HistoryServer, it reconstructs InMemoryStore from checkpoint file and gets X. Then, we could skip X events while replaying the log file basing on the partial InMemoryStore. Note that we should also recover those live entities from the the partial InMemoryStore in AppStatusListener to perform incremental replay. For a completed application, HistoryServer could just reconstructs InMemoryStore and no need to do replay.\r\n\r\nAnd in this PR, we only focus on handling InMemoryStore in HistoryServer, while LevelDB is planed to be handled in similar way in following PR.\r\n\r\nBasic experiment on a completed application of 20055 events shows the improvement of this optimization:\r\n\r\nwithout optimization  | with optimization(including deserialization time)\r\n :-: | :-: | \r\n4343 | 78(70)\r\n4512 | 92(85)\r\n4475 | 74(68)\r\n4254 | 93(78)\r\n4126 | 81(71)\r\n\r\nWork TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] compression support when checkpoint InMemoryStore\r\n- [ ] More accurate conversion from wrapper data to live entity\r\n- [ ] checkpoint file cleaning in HistoryServer\r\n- [ ] overcome frequently StackOverError in deserialization\r\n- [ ] SparkListenerStageExecutorMetrics synchronization between EventLoggingListener and AppStatusListener when log stage executor metrics is enabled\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChange is needed because HistoryServer now could be very slow to replay a large log file at the first time and it always re-replay an in-progress log file after it changes which leads to low efficiency. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, if user wants to use this optimization by several new configurations.  \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly tested manually yet, still work in process.","created_at":"2019-08-25T16:23:34Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T00:05:53Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T00:05:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8fe17af7d60d19dc07a34bec432e7b971cca855","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn ALS ML implementation, for non-implicit case, we checkpoint the RDD of item factors, between intervals. Before checkpointing (.checkpoint()) and materializing (.count()) RDD, this RDD was not persisted. It causes recomputation. In an experiment, there is performance difference between persisting and no persisting before checkpointing the RDD.\r\n\r\nThe performance difference is not big, but this change is not big too. The actual performance difference varies depending the interval of checkpoint, training dataset, etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPersisting the RDD before checkpointing the RDD of item factors can avoid recomputation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual check RDD recomputation or not.\r\n\r\nTaking 30% MovieLens 20M Dataset as training dataset. Setting checkpoint dir for SparkContext. Fitting an ALS model like:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval als = new ALS()\r\n      .setMaxIter(100)\r\n      .setCheckpointInterval(5)\r\n      .setRegParam(0.01)\r\n      .setUserCol(\"userId\")\r\n      .setItemCol(\"movieId\")\r\n      .setRatingCol(\"rating\")\r\n\r\nval t0 = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\nval model = als.fit(training)\r\nval t1 = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:  65.386 s\r\nAfter this patch: 61.022

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR replaces the hard-coded non-nullability of the array elements returned by `freqItems()` with a nullability that reflects the original schema. Essentially [the functional change](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25575/files#diff-bf59bb9f3dc351f5bf6624e5edd2dcf4R122) to the schema generation is:\r\n```\r\nStructField(name + \"_freqItems\", ArrayType(dataType, false))\r\n```\r\nBecomes:\r\n```\r\nStructField(name + \"_freqItems\", ArrayType(dataType, originalField.nullable))\r\n```\r\n\r\nRespecting the original nullability prevents issues when Spark depends on `ArrayType`'s `containsNull` being accurate. The example that uncovered this is calling `collect()` on the dataframe (see [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28818) for full repro). Though it's likely that there a several places where this could cause a problem. \r\n\r\nI've also refactored a small amount of the surrounding code to remove some unnecessary steps and group together related operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI think it's pretty clear why this change is needed. It fixes a bug that currently prevents users from calling `df.freqItems.collect()` along with potentially causing other, as yet unknown, issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNullability of columns when calling freqItems on them is now respected after the change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a test that specifically tests the carry-through of the nullability as well as explicitly calling `collect()` to catch the exact regression that was observed. I also ran the test against the old version of the code and it fails as expected.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-25T06:03:11Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T00:03:35Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T01:49:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"989e427aa5c0be2f4a8f3f1f5f2e74779a3a2752","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/279fb1ca0883fa86e41690ae8040300d57bdd1de","head":{"label":"MGHawes:mhawes/SPARK-28818","ref":"mhawes/SPARK-28818","sha":"279fb1ca0883fa86e41690ae8040300d57bdd1de","user":{"login":"MGHawes","id":26897711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODk3NzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26897711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes","html_url":"https://github.com/MGHawes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203726829,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM3MjY4Mjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MGHawes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MGHawes","id":26897711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODk3NzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26897711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes","html_url":"https://github.com/MGHawes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MGHawes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MGHawes/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25373. The problem was found at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25373#issuecomment-522369924 due to different resource paths during the tests.\r\n\r\nIt works around just simply by always using sql-tests from the source.\r\nNote that Seems similar way is already used when SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES is enabled, and referring `spark.home` property or `SPARK_HOME` is a proper way to detect some paths too.\r\n\r\nSee the original PR description:\r\n\r\nThis PR build a test framework that directly re-run all the tests in `SQLQueryTestSuite` via Thrift Server. But it's a little different from `SQLQueryTestSuite`:\r\n1. Can not support [UDF testing](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/44e607e9213bdceab970606fb15292db2fe157c2/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLQueryTestSuite.scala#L293-L297).\r\n2. Can not support `DESC` command and `SHOW` command because `SQLQueryTestSuite` [formatted the output](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1882912cca4921d3d8c8632b3bb34e69e8119791/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/HiveResult.scala#L38-L50.).\r\n\r\nWhen building this framework, found two bug:\r\n[SPARK-28624](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28624): `make_date` is inconsistent when reading from table\r\n[SPARK-28611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28611): Histogram's height is different\r\n\r\nfound two features that ThriftServer can not support:\r\n[SPARK-28636](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28636): ThriftServer can not support decimal type with negative scale\r\n[SPARK-28637](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28637): ThriftServer can not support interval type\r\n\r\nAlso, found two inconsistent behavior:\r\n[SPARK-28620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28620): Double type returned for float type in Beeline/JDBC\r\n[SPARK-28619](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28619):  The golden result file is different when tested by `bin/spark-sql`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve test coverage in thrift server and ensure same queries work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via SBT and Maven roughly. Jenkins build is needed to verify if it works or not.","created_at":"2019-08-25T04:49:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:42Z","closed_at":"2019-08-25T05:04:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f297c70504662108960e9a527e401f5f69373650","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae8f666a3756d084657dbe3e889e6567ce95a8a8","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28527","ref":"SPARK-28527","sha":"ae8f666a3756d084657dbe3e889e6567ce95a8a8","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a LogicalNode AlreadyPlanned, and related physical plan and preparation rule.\r\n\r\nWith the DataSourceV2 write operations, we have a way to fallback to the V1 writer APIs using InsertableRelation. The gross part is that we're in physical land, but the InsertableRelation takes a logical plan, so we have to pass the logical plans to these physical nodes, and then potentially go through re-planning.\r\n\r\nA useful primitive could be specifying that a plan is ready for execution through a logical node AlreadyPlanned. This would wrap a physical plan, and then we can go straight to execution. In addition, if you have queries which you re-run over again with minor parameter changes, you can leverage this node to avoid re-planning potentially huge query plans. An example of this could be Parametrized Views in SQL Server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid having a physical plan that is disconnected from the physical plan that is being executed in V1WriteFallback execution. When a physical plan node executes a logical plan, the inner query is not connected to the running physical plan. The physical plan that actually runs is not visible through the Spark UI and its metrics are not exposed. In some cases, the EXPLAIN plan doesn't show it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nV1FallbackWriterSuite tests that writes still work, and we also introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR build a test framework that directly re-run all the tests in `SQLQueryTestSuite` via Thrift Server. But it's a little different from `SQLQueryTestSuite`:\r\n1. Can not support [UDF testing](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/44e607e9213bdceab970606fb15292db2fe157c2/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLQueryTestSuite.scala#L293-L297).\r\n2. Can not support `DESC` command and `SHOW` command because `SQLQueryTestSuite` [formatted the output](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1882912cca4921d3d8c8632b3bb34e69e8119791/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/HiveResult.scala#L38-L50.).\r\n\r\nWhen building this framework, found two bug:\r\n[SPARK-28624](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28624): `make_date` is inconsistent when reading from table\r\n[SPARK-28611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28611): Histogram's height is different\r\n\r\nfound two features that ThriftServer can not support:\r\n[SPARK-28636](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28636): ThriftServer can not support decimal type with negative scale\r\n[SPARK-28637](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28637): ThriftServer can not support interval type\r\n\r\nAlso, found two inconsistent behavior:\r\n[SPARK-28620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28620): Double type returned for float type in Beeline/JDBC\r\n[SPARK-28619](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28619):  The golden result file is different when tested by `bin/spark-sql`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove the overall test coverage for Thrift Server. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the leak of crc files from CheckpointFileManager when FileContextBasedCheckpointFileManager is being used.\r\n\r\nSpark hits the Hadoop bug, [HADOOP-16255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16255) which seems to be a long-standing issue.\r\n\r\nThis is there're two `renameInternal` methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void renameInternal(Path src, Path dst)\r\npublic void renameInternal(final Path src, final Path dst, boolean overwrite)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be overridden to handle all cases but ChecksumFs only overrides method with 2 params, so when latter is called FilterFs.renameInternal(...) is called instead, and it will do rename with RawLocalFs as underlying filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe bug is related to FileContext, so FileSystemBasedCheckpointFileManager is not affected.\r\n\r\n[SPARK-17475](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17475) took a workaround for this bug, but [SPARK-23966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23966) seemed to bring regression.\r\n\r\nThis PR deletes crc file as \"best-effort\" when renaming, as failing to delete crc file is not that critical to fail the task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents crc files not being cleaned up even purging batches. Too many files in same directory often hurts performance, as well as each crc file occupies more space than its own size so possible to occupy nontrivial amount of space when batches go up to 100000+.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSome unit tests are modified to check leakage of crc files.","created_at":"2019-08-23T06:46:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T14:40:54Z","closed_at":"2019-08-23T14:40:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66857076291d54351a4daf125bf1340f20e0e335","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to clean up the commit logs by removing the comments of our PR template.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark

Sometime we forget to clean up them because GitHub hides them nicely. It would be great if we clean up this. Otherwise, this makes the commit logs too verbose.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe Experimental and Evolving annotations are both (like Unstable) used to express that a an API may change. However there are many things in the code that have been marked that way since even Spark 1.x. Per the dev@ thread, anything introduced at or before Spark 2.3.0 is pretty much 'stable' in that it would not change without a deprecation cycle. Therefore I'd like to remove most of these annotations. And, remove the `:: Experimental ::` scaladoc tag too. And likewise for Python, R.\r\n\r\nThe changes below can be summarized as:\r\n- Generally, anything introduced at or before Spark 2.3.0 has been unmarked as neither Evolving nor Experimental\r\n- Obviously experimental items like DSv2, Barrier mode, ExperimentalMethods are untouched\r\n- I _did_ unmark a few MLlib classes introduced in 2.4, as I am quite confident they're not going to change (e.g. KolmogorovSmirnovTest, PowerIterationClustering)\r\n\r\nIt's a big change to review, so I'd suggest scanning the list of _files_ changed to see if any area seems like it should remain partly experimental and examine those.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMany of these annotations are incorrect; the APIs are de facto stable. Leaving them also makes legitimate usages of the annotations less meaningful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-08-22T14:11:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-23T17:24:23Z","closed_at":"2019-09-01T15:15:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"976634a6559710a4594479d3bc8e25d294ad24b9","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch upports a conf to organize filePartition by file path. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen dynamicly writing data to hdfs it may generates a lot of small files, so sometimes we need to merge those files. When reading this files and writing again, it will be helpful if the read file RDD partitions is formed by partitions on hdfs.\r\n\r\nCurrently in FileSourceScanExec.createNonBucketedReadRDD after spliting files, spark will sort files with file size so it may scatter the partition distribution of the data files. It is a great help to support sort by file path here.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid to thrown NPE at context cleaner when shuffle service is on - it is kind of a small followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24817\r\n\r\nSeems like it sets `null` for `shuffleIds` to track when the service is on. Later, `removeShuffle` tries to remove an element at `shuffleIds` which leads to NPE. It fixes it by explicitly not sending the event (`ShuffleCleanedEvent`) in this case.\r\n\r\nSee the code path

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen starting python processes, set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to the number of cores allocated to an executor or driver if `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is not already set. Each python process will use the same `OMP_NUM_THREADS` setting, even if workers are not shared.\r\n\r\nThis avoids creating an OpenMP thread pool for parallel processing with a number of threads equal to the number of cores on the executor and [significantly reduces memory consumption](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10455). Instead, this threadpool should use the number of cores allocated to the executor, if available. If a setting for number of cores is not available, this doesn't change any behavior. OpenMP is used by numpy and pandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce memory consumption for PySpark jobs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nValidated this reduces python worker memory consumption by more than 1GB on our cluster.","created_at":"2019-08-21T23:00:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T01:30:01Z","closed_at":"2019-08-30T01:30:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f75ed03f845170678b81c0976c432146fe369e99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4655bce47949dc2777c3e9dd3c764d8582002ca8","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-28843-set-omp-num-cores","ref":"SPARK-28843-set-omp-num-cores","sha":"4655bce47949dc2777c3e9dd3c764d8582002ca8","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark uses Netty 4 directly, but also includes Netty 3 only because transitive dependencies do. The dependencies (Hadoop HDFS, Zookeeper, Avro) don't seem to need this dependency as used in Spark. I think we can forcibly remove it to slim down the dependencies.\r\n\r\nPrevious attempts were blocked by its usage in Flume, but that dependency has gone away.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15436\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMostly to reduce the transitive dependency size and complexity a little bit and avoid triggering spurious security alerts on Netty 3.x usage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-21T22:58:15Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T13:40:15Z","closed_at":"2019-08-22T04:28:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97db960f36127067ee4994fd7b1368d07fb22de9","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa3bdf6d16ca8b77943ed166733d33411ae80492","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-17875","ref":"SPARK-17875","sha":"fa3bdf6d16ca8b77943ed166733d33411ae80492","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror
