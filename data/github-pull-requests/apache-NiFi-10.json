\r\n- Handling newer revisions in flow reducer to ensure that the appropriate version of the component is saved in case responses are received out of order.\r\n\r\nThis addresses an issue that occurs for slow connections and there are very large flows. Under these circumstances, a user would issue a request to add or remove a component between when the canvas polling starts and completes. This can be easily simulated by adding a `delay` to the `pipe` following the API call and before `loadProcessGroupSuccess` is dispatched.\r\n\r\nThis PR additionally adds an override to skip the revision check when a nodes cluster connection state changes. This is important because the basis for component revisions changes when the node is connected to the cluster from when it's disconnected.","created_at":"2024-05-07T19:26:17Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T13:57:58Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T13:57:58Z","merged_at":"2024-05-08T13:57:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"eda98121ce57cdf655e485be47e80675e18e4777","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6268187900,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAanjsM8AAAABdZz0_A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/new%20ui","name":"new

Currently the client is configured with the repo information, including a branch and optional path in the repo to use, otherwise the root of the repo is used. \r\n\r\nBuckets are directories underneath the location in the repo. The client will check for a bucket named `Default`, and if it does not exist it will be created. Additional buckets can be created by adding additional directories to the repo outside of NiFi. \r\n\r\nThe branch is planned to become part of the version control screens when saving/importing which is tracked by. [NIFI-13127](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13127). Until then, the branch that is configured in the client will be used for all operations, so in order to work on different branches, it currently requires creating separate registry clients pointing at the same repo, but different branches.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to import flows from a public repo that you don't have permissions to by not providing an access token. This will allow import and change version, but attempting to save a change will result in a \"not found\" exception which is GitHub's behavior when you specify a branch or file that you don't have access to, even though it may be in the repo.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13160](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13160) Corrects evaluation of the `steps.changes.outputs.frontend` variable in the GitHub `ci-workflow` when setting the `frontend.skipTests` build property. The initial implementation always set the `frontend.skipTests` value to `false`. The updated approach follows ternary example from [GitHub Actions Expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#example) documentation.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [ ] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [ ] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13160](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13160) Supports skipping unit tests in the `nifi-web-frontend` module using a property named `frontend.skipTests`.\r\n\r\nThe property defaults to `false`, avoiding running tests on default builds. Changes include adding a [paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) step to the GitHub `ci-workflow` to support conditional enabling of frontend unit tests when pull requests include changes for the `nifi-web-frontend` module.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI. Any contributions that update the [current UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui) also need to be implemented in the [new UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-frontend/src/main/nifi).  \r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\n- [ ] New dependencies are compatible with

In case no channel name is specified, another Slack API call ([conversations.info](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.info)) is used to fetch the channel names for the channel IDs and no need to fetch the whole conversation list.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [x] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [x] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [ ] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [x ] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI. Any contributions that update the [current UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui) also need to be implemented in the [new UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-frontend/src/main/nifi).  \r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\n- [ ] New dependencies

It adds new methods related to branches which have default implementations, and changes the parameters of other methods to use \"location\" objects to consolidate the combos of branch/bucketId/flowId/version that need to be passed around.\r\n\r\nThe NiFi Registry client will ignore the incoming branch on all methods and continue to function as it always has.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a REST API for retrieving branches:\r\n`nifi-api/flow/registries/{registryId}/branches`\r\n\r\nOptional query param on the REST API for retrieving buckets:\r\n`/nifi-api/flow/registries/{registryId}/buckets?branch=main`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.
