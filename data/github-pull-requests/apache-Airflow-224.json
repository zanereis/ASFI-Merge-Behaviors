Bug Fix\r\n\r\nCurrently `py_requirements` defaults to an empty list in the Dataflow operator if no value is passed into the function call:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/dataflow.py#L514\r\n\r\nAs such the check in the hook:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/dataflow.py#L655\r\nwill always evaluate to True - running the Dataflow commands inside a virtualenv.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects the evaluation behaviour of the `if` statement so that an empty list will evaluate as `false`.\r\n\r\n### UnitTests\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR two unit tests have been introduced, for testing the calls with an empty/non-empty `py_requirements`.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10374\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

this change we utilise the latest pull_request_target\r\nevent type from Github Actions and we are building the\r\nCI image only once (per version) for the entire run.\r\n\r\nThis safes from 2 to 10 minutes per job (!) depending on\r\nhow much of the Docker image needs to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nIt works in the way that the image is built only in the\r\nbuild-or-wait step. In case of direct push run or\r\nscheduled runs, the build-or-wait step builds and pushes\r\nto the GitHub registry the CI image. In case of the\r\npull_request runs, the build-and-wait step waits until\r\nseparate build-ci-image.yml workflow builds and pushes\r\nthe image and it will only move forward once the image\r\nis ready.\r\n\r\nThis has numerous advantages:\r\n\r\n1) Each job that requires CI image is much faster because\r\n   instead of pulling + rebuilding the image it only pulls\r\n   the image that was build once. This saves around 2 minutes\r\n   per job in regular builds but in case of python patch level\r\n   updates, or adding new requirements it can save up to 10\r\n   minutes per job (!)\r\n\r\n2) While the images are buing rebuilt we only block one job waiting\r\n   for all the images. The tests will start running in parallell\r\n   only when all images are ready, so we are not blocking\r\n   other runs from running.\r\n\r\n3) Whole run uses THE SAME image. Previously we could have some\r\n   variations because the images were built at different times\r\n   and potentially releases of dependencies in-between several\r\n   jobs could make different jobs in the same run use slightly\r\n   different image. This is not happening any more.\r\n\r\n4) Also when we push image to github or dockerhub we push the\r\n   very same image that was built and tested. Previously it could\r\n   happen that the image pushed was slightly different than the\r\n   one that was used for testing (for the same reason)\r\n\r\n5) Similar case is with the production images. We are now building\r\n   and pushing consistently the same images accross the board.\r\n\r\n6) Documentation building is split into two parallel jobs docs\r\n   building and spell checking - decreases elapsed time for\r\n   the docs build.\r\n\r\n7) Last but not least - we keep the history of al the images\r\n   - those images contain SHA of the commit. This means\r\n   that we can simply download and run the image locally to reproduce\r\n   any problem that anyone had in their PR (!). This is super useful\r\n   to be able to help others to test their problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is a BUG in helm chart where, setting anything in `podMutation` in `values.yaml` does not seem to affect anything. Currently these `podMutations` will not apply during deployment to `airflow_local_settings.py`, hence they will not be used by Kubernetes Executor and Pod Operator to correctly set `taints` and `affinities` in pod configuration. \r\n\r\nThis PR should fix this, but only if `.Values.scheduler.airflowLocalSettings` were not set but it seems it was by design originally. \r\n\r\n### If you like to reproduce the bug:\r\n* Firstly use `KubernetesExecutor` for the `Airflow` deployment. \r\n* Simply add desired `toleration` and/or `affinity` in `podMutation`.\r\n* Deploy some dag/task etc. \r\n* Check that newly created pods do not have either `tolerations` and `affinities` set in their pod configuration.
