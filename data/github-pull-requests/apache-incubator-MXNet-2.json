Description ##\r\nChange analogous to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/21008 on master.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the possibility to re-run the test with all batches used for calibration of quantized model.\r\nIf test fails with only one batch used for calibration, it will be re-run with all batches to achieve better representation of the whole data range and more precise quantization scales. Thanks to that, loss in accuracy caused by too small calibration dataset will be avoided.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-04T16:17:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-18T08:01:47Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T08:01:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb0ad3908240be903240ad615f7cd969e1766d35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the tests by allowing them to use the whole batch of data for calibration of quantized model. \r\nBefore, data was unnecessary divided into smaller parts and only one of them was used for calibration which resulted in worse representation of the whole data range and less precise quantization scales, as well as slower execution due to the overhead connected with dividing data. \r\nAfter this change, the whole batch is used to calculate quantization scales and loss in accuracy caused by too small calibration dataset will be avoided.","created_at":"2022-04-27T16:02:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T05:54:39Z","closed_at":"2022-05-23T05:54:39Z","merged_at":"2022-05-23T05:54:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ca3b27635a289ef197a17eeb627464ce1c20b76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

whether an op is converted (to low precision) or not.\r\n  - [x] Added tests covering this issue\r\n    - [x] Created a file for common (cpu and gpu) AMP tests: `tests/python/amp/common.py`\r\n- [x] Enabled bf16 input for calibrated `quantize_v2` ops (removes the need for `amp_cast` before `quantize_v2` for quantized models)\r\n- [x] Fixed adding forward hooks\r\n- [x] Add AMP disabling using a context manager","created_at":"2022-03-31T17:04:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T12:34:09Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T12:34:09Z","merged_at":"2022-05-17T12:34:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"3098af4a808f905e285a4100c6b96b8e126c2c5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

After further investigation it turned out that the problem occurs for the amount of input channels (second dim) is lower than 4. There was a temporary fix in place: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20847 forcing blocking the weights by 8 instead of 16, but it turned out only to make the problem occur less often.

After further investigation it turned out that the problem occurs for the amount of input channels (second dim) is lower than 4. There was a temporary fix in place: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20847 forcing blocking the weights by 8 instead of 16, but it turned out only to make the problem occur less often.

Description ##\r\nThis PR supplies a missing check for extreme negative k values in the mxnet.numpy.eye() implementation.  I believe this was the reason why the array_api tests needed to be run with MXNET_ENABLE_CYTHON=0, since apparently Cython produced overflow errors for some eye() test cases where ctypes did not.  This PR re-enables Cython uniformly for both the centos and macosx jobs that perform the array_api testing.  This PR should resolve https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20963 by supplying the root cause fix, not by disabling Cython as is discussed in the issue.\r\n\r\nFYI @barry-jin \r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis PR ports the unittest fixes of MXNet v1.x PR 20940 to MXNet 2.0.  MXNet v1.x used PR 20940 to advance its numpy version from 1.18.5 to numpy 1.19.  MXNet 2.0 has already advanced to use numpy 1.19, but did so by skipping the failing tests.  Thus, the plan with this PR is to first re-enable the skipped tests, to show them once again failing, then push the fixes to unittests test_np_delete and test_np_array_function_protocol from v1.x PR 20940.  In addition, the 3 tests test_np_random_{beta,f,chisquare} need a fix present in v1.x from a different PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g.

Description ##\r\nThere are vulnerabilities reported in numpy versions currently used in our CI system, as mentioned in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20869:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41495\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41496\r\n\r\nThese issues require a numpy version >= 1.19.1 to avoid.  This PR takes the somewhat conservative approach of only advancing the numpy version to 1.19.5 (actually <1.20.0) in order to avoid the issues, without advancing numpy farther and risking creating additional issues.  Note that the numpy version is not restricted to >=1.19.1, since some of the build and test environments do not support numpy 1.19.  Thus, with this PR, MXNet will be built to avoid the vulnerabilities if the system supports it.\r\n\r\nThe unittests that started failing on numpy 1.19 were test_np_delete and test_np_array_function_protocol, due to the change in the way numpy 1.19 delete() interprets the indices-to-delete when supplied as an array.  The tests were modified to pass for all versions of numpy, both 1.19 and earlier. See https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release.html for more details.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE],

Description ##\r\nElementwise binary broadcast operators such as add, subtract, multiply, divide in MXNet NumPy module support mixed inputs of float and integer type. Goal of this change is to add support of those operators for bfloat with fp32 and fp64 mixed input cases. Additionally oneDNN will be used when processing fp32 and bfloat cases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL],

the use of mkl library for which case (MXNet built with MKL) oneDNN will not replace previous

For fixing this issue, an initial solution was provided in #20499 by @khaotik.
