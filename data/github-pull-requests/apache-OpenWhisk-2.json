Move etcd worker to its own file under the etcd folder in commons\r\n2. Clean up the error handling to remove duplicate code\r\n3. Make the retry handling more thread safe by first forwarding the retry message and using the actor's internal timers scheduler rather than the system scheduler\r\n4. Fix non-thread safe access to actor member variable `lease` from future callbacks through 3.\r\n5. Add unit tests for EtcdWorker which previously wasn't covered.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to

Description\r\nThe scheduler throttling activations can be asynchronous off the api path so a 429 is not returned to denote a throttle. The user must get the activation and look at why it failed. Action developer errors are generally non-retryable issues whereas whisk errors are usually considered retryable for the user. Though still not a perfect classification this new failure mode probably needs a new status code of throttle type, but that can be done later. This allows you to configure whether you want these errors to be action developer errors or whisk errors\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis is to revert the recent change.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5251 is introduced to handle the cyclic activations storm in a queue manager.\r\nBut with this change, I observed severe performance degradation.\r\n\r\nThis is the performance measurement with the current master.\r\n<img width=\"1217\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/182029788-eff06df6-a2a9-495a-b0d4-1aa578827037.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd this is the result of this change.\r\n<img width=\"1226\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/182029821-5f38b4b2-9cff-4591-a87a-a21fc015f185.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is because even for normal activations, the queue manager tries to recover a queue.\r\nThere is a gap between the time that leader election is done(etcd data is written) and the queue is ready.\r\nIf activations come during that time, the queue manager tries to recover a queue and it increases the wait time.\r\n\r\nAnd the result is well aligned with the one I performed for the initial run.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5194#issuecomment-1019875232\r\n\r\nSince the cycle in a critical path is also a big problem, we must handle it.\r\nBut until we find a better way to address it I think it would be better to revert this change.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to

e.g. {\"name\": \"jack\"}\r\nanother activation's result's name filed value is int, e.g. {\"name\": 12}\r\nElasticsearch doesn't support this, it store like this, it would report error.\r\n\r\n* Other works\r\n\r\nAs above example, we already know, `nodejs` runtime supports this feature by default.\r\nBut other runtimes(e.g. go, java, php, etc) don't support,\r\n1. After this pr merged, there still has other works for runtime images, need to support subsequent prs for other images.\r\n2. And in CLI side, still has small mount works to parse the JSON array string to user.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis is a wip and trying to get feedback if this is an option we could support. This would add two new configs for the scheduler:\r\n\r\n      ```allow-over-provision-before-throttle = true\r\n      namespace-over-provision-before-throttle-ratio = 1.5``` (would it be preferred by people that this is a fixed value rather than ratio)\r\n\r\nIf the first config is false, the ratio is not used anywhere. But the purpose of this is to prevent deadlocking on the new scheduler for actions within a namespace due to the new concept of namespace throttling. Since the scheduler can be aggressive with initially over-provisioning, you can get into a scenario where a single action uses up all of the container concurrency of the namespace before another action gets a change to run. What the code change below attempts to do is up the container concurrency limit to the over provision threshold to allow new actions to have a chance to run. This is really needed if one action depends on another. i.e. action a attempts to execute action b, but action a has all of the action concurrency for the namespace. The workload now will never make progress and action a will only ever fail all of its executions. Ultimately the right thing to do is scale out the namespace, but that's manual by a human and can't be done until impact has already occurred and this helps mitigate by slowing throughput rather than total failures.\r\n\r\nExample of how it works:\r\n\r\n- Namespace A has a container concurrency limit of 30\r\n- Action A uses all 30 containers\r\n- With an over provision before throttle ratio of 1.5, the namespace can actually have a max total of 45 containers.\r\n- Action B comes in and since the namespace has hit its initial limit, the scheduler gives it max of 1 container until the number of containers for the namespace goes below it's normal limit of 30. Since it's not likely provisioned enough it will get action throttled which is still better than not letting any traffic at all.\r\n- The namespace can get a total of 15 additional actions with a max of 1 container before it is now completely over-provisioned and gets namespace throttled so no additional containers can be created.\r\n\r\nI'll admit this is a little hacky, but I do think we need to account for this throttling case until we are able to support action level container concurrency limits. So any better ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nI am working on integrating the new scheduler into openwhisk-deploy-kube (see this draft PR [here](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/pull/729)). While most of the changes that need to be made are within the apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube repo, some changes need to be made here for full support.\r\n\r\nNamely:\r\n* Scheduler images need to be build and pushed to dockerhub\r\n* The scheduler and controller both need to option to use the akka cluster discovery in the case that they are replicated; the existing mechanism of using seedNodes is not a great fit for Kubernetes deployments\r\n\r\nI tested locally (mostly using Kubernetes deployments) but I'm not sure the best way to test the tooling and changes to travis/CI. \r\n\r\nNote that while I did, in general, try to integrate the scheduler into the tooling, I did not attempt to add it to ```dev/src/main/groovy/intellijRunConfig.groovy```, as I don't have experience in this area.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nCurrently, if the system fails to pull a black-box image, it keeps waiting for the runtime pod to be running.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl get pods\r\n...\r\nwsk-blue-test-invoker-38-47-style95-dockeraction     0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          41h\r\nwsk-blue-test-invoker-38-48-style95-dockeraction     0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          41h\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the pod creation is failed due to image pulling, we can complete activations with an error.\r\nAnother case is a black-box pod is failed to run because a command is not found.\r\nIn such cases, the system can let users know about the issues in their images.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one.

In short, the install-package pods deployed via openwhisk-deploy-kube project helm charts fails due to using the default npm installed by apt to install alarm package. This PR basically update the npm in docker image ow-utils which is used by the install-package pod.\r\n\r\nI have built the image with `./gradlew tools:ow-utils:distDocker`, pushed my own repository, and configure the helm charts to use it. And I can successfully deploy openwhisk on my kubernetes cluster again. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#5260 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThe current scheduler wait time metric emits as soon as the queue manager receives an activation. From this point it's then put on to the respective action queue in which it may wait for variable amounts of time until the activation is retrieved by an action container from the queue. The existing wait time metric still exists but is renamed to `kafkaWaitTime` since it's essentially the wait time from when the transaction starts to when it gets to the scheduler. The new version of `waitTime` metric emits for an action whenever the action either is force error completed within the memory queue or when the activation is forwarded to an action container and removed from the scheduler queue.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n-

Description\r\nI believe that the subaction for these two metrics should be the action instead of the namespace since there is a separate container metric for namespaces called `namespaceContainer` where the namespace is the subaction.

Description\r\nQuick fix for the conf key in the default conf file for the new per min throttle config for fpc I made yesterday. The config key in the configuration file was incorrect. I've verified this fixes the issue. I also have verified that per minute throttling now works on the new scheduler same as the old scheduler when setting this config.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## My changes affect

Description\r\nCould use some help verifying this actually works as I'm not totally familiar with the entitlement code path, but I'm pretty sure I have what is needed here since the `FPCEntitlementProvider` just extends from the original overriding the `checkThrottles`.\r\n\r\nSo FPC currently doesn't support per minute throttling of namespaces. While the system no longer needs these throttles to protect itself with the new fpc scheduler enhancement, it is still a valuable feature to allow for user functions to protect their downstream by having reasonable per minute limits. And it's just a feature that I think is unnecessarily lost if still needed for certain use cases. Ideally people can slowly move away from using this feature, but having the option at least available makes it easier for people to more quickly migrate to fpc from their existing cluster that might be dependent on it.\r\n\r\nSince the contributors of FPC to the open source repository do not use the feature, I've set the default config value to not include the per minute throttling. I personally think the default should probably be to have it still turned on right now, but I will let them decide on that. \r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and

Description\r\nAdd missing load balancer metrics that previously existed in the old scheduler. Since there is no longer a concept of managed / blackbox to the load balancer, some of the metrics are just all encompassing now and not differentiated by invoker type. This is useful to see how large your invoker fleet currently is that's healthy and unhealthy without having to hit the controller's invoker endpoint and emitting your own status externally. Also added in the completion ack metrics which were also missing\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [X] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#5231)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [X] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

But, Openwhisk only has a system limit for action shared by all namespaces.\r\nThere is no way to adjust the action limit for a few users, and changing the action limit setting will affect all users.\r\n\r\nIn some private environments, you can operate Openwhisk more flexibly by providing different action limits.\r\n(For example, providing high memory only to some users.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n          256M                               512M\r\n\r\n            │     namespace default limit      │\r\n            ▼                                  ▼\r\n ┌──────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────────┐\r\n │          │┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┼│----------► │                        │\r\n └──────────┴──────────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────────────────┘\r\n ▲                                                          ▲                        ▲\r\n │ system limit                                             │ namespace limit        │ system limit\r\n\r\n128M                                                      1024M                    2048M\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n### 3 types of action limits\r\n\r\nThere was only a system limit shared by all namespaces, but two more concepts for namespace limits are added.\r\n\r\n- (1) system limit: It can never be exceeded under any circumstances.\r\n- (2) namespace default limit: It can be used if a limit has not been set for a namespace.\r\n- (3) namespace limit: It can be set by a system administrator for a namespace and cannot exceed the range of the system limit.\r\n\r\n### Limit configs for namespace\r\n\r\n- The maxParameterSize, maxPayloadSize and truncationSize values are treated as `ByteSize` string. (e.g. 1 MB, 512 KB...)\r\n\r\nThe following settings are new:\r\n\r\nconfig key             | Type                         | description\r\n---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------\r\nminActionMemory        | integer (unit: MB)           | minimum action memory size for namespace\r\nmaxActionMemory        | integer (unit: MB)           | maximum action memory size for namespace\r\nminActionLogs          | integer (unit: MB)           | minimum activation log size for namespace\r\nmaxActionLogs          | integer (unit: MB)           | maximum activation log size for namespace\r\nminActionTimeout       | integer (unit: milliseconds) | minimum action time limit for namespace\r\nmaxActionTimeout       | integer (unit: milliseconds) | maximum action time limit for namespace\r\nminActionConcurrency   | integer                      | minimum action concurrency limit for namespace\r\nmaxActionConcurrency   | integer                      | maximum action concurrency limit for namespace\r\nmaxParameterSize       | string  (format: ByteSize)   | maximum parameter size for namespace\r\nmaxPayloadSize         | string  (format: ByteSize)   | maximum payload size for namespace\r\ntruncationSize         | string  (format: ByteSize)   | activation truncation size for namespace\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limit document for CouchDB\r\n\r\nYou can set namespace limits with `{namespace}/limits` document just like any other existing settings (invocationsPerMinute, concurrentInvocations..).\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"concurrentInvocations\": 100,\r\n  \"invocationsPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"firesPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"maxActionMemory\": 1024,\r\n  \"minActionMemory\": 128,\r\n  \"maxActionConcurrency\": 400,\r\n  \"minActionConcurrency\": 1,\r\n  \"maxActionLogs\": 128,\r\n  \"minActionLogs\": 0,\r\n  \"maxParameterSize\": \"1048576 B\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using wskadmin command (tool)\r\n- In general, it is recommended to use a wskadmin rather than modify the DB directly.\r\n- There is plan to provide the feauture to change namespace limits in wskadmin.\r\n\r\n### Namespace Limit API\r\n\r\nUser can get the applied action limits of the namespace by the namespace limit API.\r\nIf the namespace's action limit is not set, the default namespace limit value will be returned.\r\n\r\n> GET /api/v1/namespaces/_/limits\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"concurrentInvocations\": 30,\r\n  \"firesPerMinute\": 60,\r\n  \"invocationsPerMinute\": 60,\r\n  \"maxActionConcurrency\": 500,\r\n  \"maxActionLogs\": 0,\r\n  \"maxActionMemory\": 512,\r\n  \"maxActionTimeout\": 300000,\r\n  \"maxParameterSize\": \"1048576 B\",\r\n  \"minActionConcurrency\": 1,\r\n  \"minActionLogs\": 0,\r\n  \"minActionMemory\": 128,\r\n  \"minActionTimeout\": 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System API (URI path: /)\r\n\r\nA namespace default limit information is additionally provided separately from the previously provided system limit information.\r\n\r\n- default_max_action_duration\r\n- default_max_action_logs\r\n- default_max_action_memory\r\n- default_min_action_duration\r\n- default_min_action_logs\r\n- default_min_action_memory\r\n\r\n#### Preview\r\n\r\n> GET /\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"api_paths\": [\r\n    \"/api/v1\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"description\": \"OpenWhisk\",\r\n  \"limits\" : {\r\n    \"actions_per_minute\": 60,\r\n    \"concurrent_actions\": 30,\r\n    \"default_max_action_duration\": 300000,\r\n    \"default_max_action_logs\": 0,\r\n    \"default_max_action_memory\": 536870912,\r\n    \"default_min_action_duration\": 100,\r\n    \"default_min_action_logs\": 0,\r\n    \"default_min_action_memory\": 134217728,\r\n    \"max_action_duration\": 300000,\r\n    \"max_action_logs\": 0,\r\n    \"max_action_memory\": 536870912,\r\n    \"min_action_duration\": 100,\r\n    \"min_action_logs\": 0,\r\n    \"min_action_memory\": 134217728,\r\n    \"sequence_length\": 50,\r\n    \"triggers_per_minute\": 60\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, if there is no namespace default limit setting, it is replaced with a system limit.\r\n\r\nAs the namespace default limit is the same as the system limit, so the administrator cannot set the namespace limit, and the user can create actions with resources (memory, logs, timeout...) up to the system limit as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Namespace limit validation\r\n\r\nPreviously, system limits were validated when unmarshalls the ActionLimits object from the user request. \r\n\r\nHowever, at the time of unmarshalls the user requests, the namespace's action limit cannot be known and the limit value cannot be included in an error message, so the validation must be performed after unmarshalling.\r\nTherefore, the code to perform this validation has been added to the controller, scheduler, and invoker.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Validate action limits when the action is created in the controller\r\n\r\nWhen an action is created in the controller, make sure that the action limits do not exceed the system limits and namespace limits.\r\n\r\nIf the namespace limits or system limits are exceeded, the namespace limit value must be returned as an error message in the response body.\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                                 ┌───────────────┐\r\n                                                 │               │\r\n                                                 │   AuthStore   │\r\n                                                 │               │\r\n                                                 └───────┬───────┘\r\n                                                         │\r\n                                                 ┌───────┴───────┐\r\n                                                 │               │\r\n                                                 │   Identity    │ UserLimits\r\n                                                 │               │ (maxActionMemory = 512M)\r\n  Create action     ┌───────────────────┐        └───────────────┘\r\n (memory = 1024M)   │                   │                ▲\r\n──────────────────► │                   │                │\r\n                    │    Controller     ├────────────────┘\r\n◄────────X───────── │                   │   Validate namespace limit\r\n   Reject request   │                   │\r\n   (1024M > 512M)   └───────────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2. Validate action limits when the action is executed in the invoker\r\n\r\nWhen the action is executed, the invoker must checks whether the action limit exceeds the system limit and namespace limits. \r\nIf the limit of the action to be executed exceeds the limit, an application error with `Messages.actionLimitExceeded` message is returned and invocation is aborted.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase _: ActionLimitsException =>\r\n  ActivationResponse.applicationError(Messages.actionLimitExceeded)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                                             ┌───────────────┐\r\n                                                             │               │\r\n                                                             │   Identity    │  UserLimits\r\n                                                             │               │  (maxActionMemory = 512M)\r\n                                                             └───────────────┘\r\n                                                                  ▲\r\n                                                                  │  Validate namespace limit\r\n                                                                  │\r\n  Invoke action     ┌───────────────────┐     Activation     ┌────┴──────────────┐\r\n (memory = 1024M)   │                   │       Message      │                   │\r\n──────────────────► │                   │ ─────────────────► │                   │\r\n                    │    Controller     │                    │      Invoker      │\r\n◄────────X───────── │                   │ ◄────────X──────── │                   │\r\n   Reject request   │                   │        Reject      │                   │\r\n                    └───────────────────┘      Invocation    └───────────────────┘\r\n                                             (1024M > 512M)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Validate action limits when the action is executed in the invoker with the scheduler\r\n\r\nThe invoker that works with the scheduler should check namespace limits when creating containers and handling activations.\r\n\r\n- When creating a container, if the requested resource of the action exceeds the namespace limit, creation is rejected and the queue is removed.\r\n- when processing an activation message, if the action exceeds the namespace limit, the activation is rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                                         ┌───────────────┐\r\n

I have received requirements to set different limits for each namespace/user. So I propose a new feature for namespace limit.\r\n\r\n### 3 types of limits\r\n- There are **(1) system limits**, **(2) namespace default limits**, **(3) namespace limits**.\r\n  - (1) system limits: under no circumstances may this limit be exceeded.\r\n  - (2) namespace default limits: use this limit value unless a limit has been set in the namespace.\r\n  - (3) namespace limit: It can be set by the system administrator. This value cannot exceed the range of the system limit.\r\n\r\n_case1) Using default namespace limit_\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5635513/166409786-bb6759f8-e860-4f1e-8524-a91cc8ddd2f9.png\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n_case1) Using namespace limit (for `foo` namespace)_\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5635513/166409938-66a257e5-e9a5-4031-9f3a-a0001a9c5c93.png\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\n### Limit doc\r\nYou can set namespace limits with `{namespace}/limits` document just like any other existing setting.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"concurrentInvocations\": 100,\r\n  \"invocationsPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"firesPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"maxActionMemory\": 128,\r\n  \"maxActionConcurrency\": 400\r\n  \"maxActionLogs\": 128,\r\n  \"maxParameterSize\": \"1 kb\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New namespace limit config\r\nconfig key             | description\r\n---------------------- | ---------------\r\nminActionMemory        | minimum action memory size for namespace\r\nmaxActionMemory        | maximum action memory size for namespace\r\nminActionLogs          | minimum activation log size for namespace\r\nmaxActionLogs          | maximum activation log size for namespace\r\nminActionTimeout       | minimum action time limit for namespace\r\nmaxActionTimeout       | maximum action time limit for namespace\r\nminActionConcurrency   | minimum action concurrency limit for namespace\r\nmaxActionConcurrency   | maximum action concurrency limit for namespace\r\nmaxParameterSize       | maximum parameter size for namespace\r\nmaxPayloadSize | maximum activation payload size for namespace\r\ntruncationSize | activation truncation size for namespace\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\nI didn't open new issue, but described the changes here.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nThe default value of pause-grace, which is 50 milliseconds by default, is too short for FPCScheduler. If requests' time intervals are longer than 50ms, the container will be paused and can't pull requests from MemoryQueue, doesn't take advantage of the ActivationProxy-ActivationService path, which is the core of FPCScheduler design. So we need to set the pause-grace to a longer value, 10s by default now.\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nTo prove this, I did a test for FPCScheduler. I sent 5 concurrent requests every 5 seconds, the second 5 requests would be successfully picked up by GetActivaion in MemoryQueue. But for subsequent concurrent requests, the SchedulingDecisionMaker would keep matching an exceptional case:\r\n```\r\n  // this is an exceptional case, create a container immediately\r\n  case (Running, _) if totalContainers == 0 && availableMsg > 0 =>\r\n    logging.info(\r\n      this,\r\n      s\"add one container if totalContainers($totalContainers) == 0 && availableMsg($availableMsg) > 0 [$invocationNamespace:$action]\")\r\n    Future.successful(DecisionResults(AddContainer, 1))\r\n```\r\nIt was because MemoryQueue told him that there were no warm containers, but actually, there were some containers already spawned for previous requests, just in paused state, and couldn't pull requests temporarily. And then SchedulingDecisonMaker tried to send container creation message to the invoker, invoker didn't create any container because there are already some warm containers, causing some latencies.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis is to reduce the keeping duration.\r\nIn FPCScheduler, this value is used to decide how much time do we keep the warmed container.\r\nCurrently, it is 60 minutes and it means after a timeout of paused container(10mins), it will keep the last container for another 60 minutes.\r\nI think this is not a good value for the default.\r\nIn many cases that people develop or test OpenWhisk, there would be fewer resources in their dev environment and this would cause out of resources easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all

enable/disable invoker support to old scheduler\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAdds enable / disabling of original invoker implementation. Disabling will turn off the scheduler of health pings so the controller will view the invoker as offline. Enabling will reschedule the health pings if it was disabled. Also added a route for both invoker types to check if an invoker is disabled so that the state of a running invoker does not get lost.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Scheduler\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

instructions to add configuration for akka dispatcher, add complete file paths in two places\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhen trying to deploy the new scheduler with ansible, I kept getting this error in the scheduler:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" akka.ConfigurationException: Dispatcher [dispatchers.lease-service-dispatcher] not configured for path akka://scheduler-actor-system/user/$b\r\n```\r\nAdding the dispatcher to the references.conf file fixed the error, and now I can deploy the scheduler via ansible.\r\nI've just tested this locally by invoking a few functions after deployment.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\nThis PR adds an additional config option to allow turning off writes to the db for successful non-blocking activations. Our use case does not have any need for writes for any activations in the success case anymore and this will greatly help us scale. We don't use sequential actions, have external logging, use events topic for activation metrics, and write data to a db for an activation off our consumers for the completed* topics where needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4881 where this was implemented but only allowed configuration for blocking activations.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and
