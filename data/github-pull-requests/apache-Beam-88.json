process of aggregating Javadocs is a bit sketchy in cases where source sets are shared. Particularly that’s the case for Spark and Flink runners. \r\n\r\nConsidering that everything is thrown into one bucket, we could easily end up with an inconsistent and misleading mix of Javadocs from multiple versions due to version specific overrides.\r\n\r\nThis disables Javadocs for the Spark2 runner so that `aggregateJavadoc` doesn't fail.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

lifecycle method names directly, rather than excluding all exported methods on DoFns. \r\n\r\nBreaks certain usecases with extreme number (10+) of emitter parameters, when the method doesn't have a generic representation. The static code generator works in those cases, but it isn't recommended.\r\n\r\nThe ideal work around would be to have a tagged API instead of the positional one, but that's significantly more work.\r\n\r\nUsing lifecycle names directly neutered the previous verification check anyway, so we've opted to remove that entirely. Additional tests were also added to ensure the fallthrough behavior occurs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

code does the conversion by first manually calculating the millis from a proto Timestamp with `long millis = time.getSeconds() * 1000 + time.getNanos() / 1000`, but 1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds instead of 1,000. This PR changes to use proto Timestamps util class to do the conversion in order to be less prone to such mistakes.\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a new interface, `ShuffleCompressor`, which allows users to plug in compression for values just before they're written to shuffle.\r\n\r\nThe interface is a little odd, we originally had exposed it as simply wrapping Input/Output streams.  However, this interface is much more efficient:\r\n- In the compression path, the implementor can use the RandomAccessData as both a buffer pool (using scratch space at the end for example) and also compress the data \"in place\" if possible.  Additionally, many compression algorithms can operate more efficiently on a fixed-sized buffer rather than having to deal with an unknown amount of input data.\r\n- In the decompression path, using ByteBuffer allows efficiently slicing the input and output buffers as well.  Ideally I think this interface would use ByteString as well, but didn't want to expose the shaded protobuf library in the public API.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this also changes most places in the shuffle IO path to use ByteString rather than byte[].  This allows efficiently \"slicing\" the buffer received from the shuffle reader, removing a significant number of byte[] copies.\r\n\r\nInternally we have an implementation of ShuffleCompressor that uses zstd, and we see a significant benefit from using it.  For example, at level 3 (the default), a simple `read -> reshuffle -> do something` pipeline sees a 50% reduction in data shuffled for our representative test datasets.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, if you try to call TrySplit on an offsetrange restriction with a fraction of 0.0 and without first claiming work, it sets the primary restriction to {Start, Start-1}. This causes newSplitResult to panic - https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ff39fcb5229b15140e41a61bd09f7d590730e93a/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/runtime/exec/sdf.go#L859\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by never allowing End to be set less than Start. That in turn creates a possible issue with the IsDone function (since the restriction should be considered done, but it won't be until claimed reaches End), which this PR handles as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`bigquery-samples.airline_ontime_data.flights` dataset, which this integration test relied on, was deleted. I was able to find a dataset with largely equivalent data and copy it into `apache-beam-testing`. There are just some slight differences in the field names, and there seem to be differences in NULL behavior. I could probably craft a BQ query that would produce an equivalent result as the old test, but it didn't seem worth it to invest time in that. Instead I just updated the expected value where relevant.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

adds some of the missing flags from https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/pipeline-options to the Go Sdk.\r\n\r\nThe diff is rough in places because of indentation, but the flags added are:\r\n\r\n- `dataflow_service_options`\r\n- `number_of_worker_harness_threads`\r\n- `dataflow_kms_key`\r\n- `flexrs_goal`\r\n- `enable_hot_key_logging`\r\n\r\nI tried running a pipeline with each of these enabled, though I wasn't able to validate behavior for most because they're not totally visible behavior changes, or they require pretty complex and/or expensive setups to notice a difference.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR doesn't include the following flags which are included on that page:\r\n\r\n- `worker_disk_type` - already exists on the Go Sdk as disk_type (but is currently not documented)\r\n- `update` - Jack has a PR for this in flight - #17747\r\n- `create_from_snapshot` - this flag is not useful until we support state\r\n- `sdk_location` - this is currently a python only option which I don't think we can just get for free. Additional investigation would be needed for this one.\r\n- `enable_streaming_engine` - I tried this (it should control some experiments), and we don't get it for free with the Go Sdk - we'd have to follow up with the Dataflow team to figure out what it takes to turn streaming engine on for the Go Sdk.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
