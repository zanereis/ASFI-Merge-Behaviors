4.6.1.</p>\n<p>This release fixes a problem (introduced in the 4.6.0 release) with dependency scope in the following sub-modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>picocli-codegen</li>\n<li>picocli-groovy</li>\n<li>picocli-shell-jline2</li>\n<li>picocli-shell-jline3</li>\n<li>picocli-spring-boot-starter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem was that these modules contained dependencies that were declared to have <code>implementation</code> scope instead of <code>api</code> scope.\nHowever, these were transitive dependencies, and necessary to compile any project that uses the above picocli modules.</p>\n<p>In this release, transitive dependencies are declared with <code>api</code> scope in the above modules.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sualeh\">Sualeh Fatehi</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dejan2609\">Dejan StojadinoviÄ‡</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remal\">Semyon Levin</a> for the quick community

If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues\">https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues</a>.</p>\n<p>A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button\">https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button</a></li>\n<li>If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow\">https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow</a></li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

from a Java VM), you will need to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features\">enable desugaring of Java 8 <em>language features</em></a> if you have not already done so. (And if you are releasing an Android <em>library</em>, then anyone who uses that library will also have to enable desugaring.) We expect for nearly all Android projects to have already enabled desugaring. But if this causes problems for you, please let us know on [issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5358\">#5358</a>](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5358\">google/guava#5358</a>). The purpose of this change is to detect potential problems for users now so that we can plan to use Java 8 language features in our implementation later this year.</li>\n<li>Introduced a warning log message when running <code>guava-android</code> under a Java 7 VM. (Android VMs are unaffected, aside from the need to use desugaring, described in the previous bullet.) This warning is not <em>guaranteed</em> to be logged when running under Java 7, so please don't rely on it as your only warning about future problems. If the warning <em>itself</em> causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for <code>com.google.common.base.MoreObjects$ToStringHelper</code> (which is used <em>only</em> for this warning). This warning prepares for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5269\">removing support for Java 7 in 2021</a>. Please report any problems. We have tried to make the warning as safe as possible, but anytime a common library logs, there is the potential for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/41017717/28465\"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> or even <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/48009613/28465\">deadlock</a>. (To be clear, Guava will <em>not</em> log under Java 8 or Android, but it <em>may</em> log under Java 7.) (dc52e6e385)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated <code>StandardSystemProperty.JAVA_EXT_DIRS</code>. We do not plan to remove the API, but note that, under recent versions of Java, that property always has a value of <code>null</code>. (38abf07772)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants for <code>Origin-Isolation</code> and <code>X-Request-ID</code>.
