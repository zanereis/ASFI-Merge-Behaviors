found a problem with many Italian texts that are not interpolated correctly because it uses two different ways to load the texts. Some parts of the Wiki is using an `rb.getStriong('security.error.illegalloginname')` and some parts are using the `MessageFormat.format( rb.getStriong('security.error.illegalloginname') )`, with that is very difficult to fix all sentences that uses apostrophe in Italian.\r\n\r\nI fixed some texts to enable the recovery password in Italian.\r\n\r\n### How to test\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\nimport java.text.MessageFormat;\r\n\r\nclass Simple{\r\n    public static void main(String argsx[]){\r\n\tObject[] args = { \"myemail@gmail.com\" };\r\n\tString wrongText = MessageFormat.format(\"Come richiesto, la nuova password per l'autenticazione di \\\"{0}\\\" \", args);\r\n        System.out.println(\"Message: \" + wrongText);\r\n        // result: Message: Come richiesto, la nuova password per lautenticazione di \"{0}\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\tString correctText = MessageFormat.format(\"Come richiesto, la nuova password per l''autenticazione di \\\"{0}\\\" \", args);\r\n        System.out.println(\"Message: \" + correctText);\r\n        // result: Message: Come richiesto, la nuova password per l'autenticazione di \"myemail@gmail.com\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposal of implementation\r\nCreate a new class to access the texts using the Method Overloading:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Texts {\r\n  public String getString(String name){\r\n    String text = rb.getString(name);\\\r\n    Object[] args = {};\r\n    return MessageFormat.format(text, args);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String getString(String name, Object[] args){\r\n    String text = rb.getString(name);\r\n    return MessageFormat.format(text, args);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing that will be easier to maintain all texts with accents or symbols in a central method and an easy way to implement functions to render HTML Entities.","created_at":"2022-02-22T13:50:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T20:33:13Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T20:33:12Z","merged_at":"2022-04-06T20:33:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"528c6762a4494c3aa03bd69ac5d8b252a4a3e8f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/issues/173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jspwiki/statuses/e464efb385fac4f17bd9fbb59cea858ed925a05d","head":{"label":"selialkile:fixing_italian_locale","ref":"fixing_italian_locale","sha":"e464efb385fac4f17bd9fbb59cea858ed925a05d","user":{"login":"selialkile","id":717981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/717981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile","html_url":"https://github.com/selialkile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":462303280,"node_id":"R_kgDOG44wMA","name":"jspwiki","full_name":"selialkile/jspwiki","private":false,"owner":{"login":"selialkile","id":717981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/717981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile","html_url":"https://github.com/selialkile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selialkile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/selialkile/jspwiki","description":"Apache
