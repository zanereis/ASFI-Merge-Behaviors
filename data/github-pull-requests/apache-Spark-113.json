If the key is a string literal, please add single quotes around it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo\r\n```\r\nCannot resolve column `col1` as a map key.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds DSv2 plan stability tests to be able to track plan changes with new Spark changes in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe see a few issues with TPCDS/TPCH DSv2 plans that need fixes in the future, but as a first step it would be good to track the plans.\r\nPlease note that currently:\r\n- q14a, q14b, q38, q87 are disabled in `TPCDSV1_4_V2PlanStabilitySuite`\r\n- q14, q14a are disabled in `TPCDSV2_7_V2PlanStabilitySuite`\r\n\r\nas those queries would fail in`PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin`. That is because the rule decides on pusing down joins over an aggregate if the join can be planned as a broadcast join, but the optimization need stats to be available. As the batch `Early Filter and Projection Push-Down` hasn't constructed the V2 Scans,`DataSourceV2Relation.computeStats()` throws an exception due to missing accurate stats.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR adds only new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-13T13:12:48Z","updated_at":"2023-06-16T00:21:52Z","closed_at":"2023-06-16T00:21:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47713bf32e286c64c45bb68382b4f9abfb5153ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI was writing test cases to test expressions and realized that we can allow `Project` without input plan. For example, `SELECT 1` is a valid query. For SQL it will generate `OneRowRelation` to make up the input plan but for the Connect users they shouldn't need to bother appending that relation. Instead, they can just submit a Project with expressions.\r\n\r\nPer our design, Proto is also a API layer and anyone can draft a proto plan without using built-in clients. This PR will improve the proto usability for `Project`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Improve usability.\r\n2. Help write test cases for expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-11-11T23:39:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T04:15:31Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T04:15:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77ada079cb7bd8117b41eebdc74d26f820979ab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac4afcdbe471a147b57ca2244b9a18a91cfb92e0","head":{"label":"amaliujia:SPARK-41116","ref":"SPARK-41116","sha":"ac4afcdbe471a147b57ca2244b9a18a91cfb92e0","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the exception `StreamingQueryException` by extending `SparkThrowable` and new error class `STREAM_FAILED` which is set on raising `StreamingQueryException` on any stream failures.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be consistent to other Spark's exception like `SparkException`, and to improve user experience with Spark APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it extends the existing API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParquet supports FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY (FLBA) data type. However, Spark Parquet reader currently cannot handle FLBA.\r\nThis PR proposes to read FLBA column as BinaryType data in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIceberg Parquet reader, for example, can handle FLBA.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38557 . We found that some optimizer rules can't be applied twice (those in the `Once` batch), but running the rule `OptimizeSubqueries` twice breaks it as it optimizes subqueries twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR partially reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38557 to still invoke `OptimizeSubqueries` in `RowLevelOperationRuntimeGroupFiltering`. We don't fully revert https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38557 because it's still beneficial to use IN subquery directly instead of using DPP framework as there is no join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the optimizer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUpdate the docstring for the `.groupby()` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `.groupby()` method accept a list of columns (or a single column), and a column is defined by a `Series` or name (`Label`). It's a bit confusing to say \"using a Series of columns\", because `Series` (capitalized) is a specific object that isn't actually used/reasonable to use here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes (documentation)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-11T15:30:28Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T08:06:53Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T06:50:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18bc2286c190f517acf31713c4e3c99520555aba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `applyInArrow` method to PySpark `groupBy` and `groupBy.cogroup` to allow for user functions that work on Arrow. Similar to existing `mapInArrow`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPySpark allows to transform a `DataFrame` via Pandas and Arrow API:\r\n```\r\ndf.mapInArrow(map_arrow, schema=\"...\")\r\ndf.mapInPandas(map_pandas, schema=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `df.groupBy(...)` and `df.groupBy(...).cogroup(...)`, there is only a Pandas interface, no Arrow interface:\r\n```\r\ndf.groupBy(\"id\").applyInPandas(apply_pandas, schema=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nProviding a pure Arrow interface allows user code to use **any** Arrow-based data framework, not only Pandas, e.g. Polars:\r\n```\r\ndef apply_polars(df: polars.DataFrame) -> polars.DataFrame:\r\n  return df\r\n\r\ndef apply_arrow(table: pyarrow.Table) -> pyarrow.Table:\r\n  df = polars.from_arrow(table)\r\n  return apply_polars(df).to_arrow()\r\n\r\ndf.groupBy(\"id\").applyInArrow(apply_arrow, schema=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds method `applyInPandas` to PySpark `groupBy` and `groupBy.cogroup`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested with unit tests.","created_at":"2022-11-11T12:22:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T21:50:05Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T01:21:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e16fb9d21f9bece7dae6dfda96d1f219e4199a55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5191137bc2fa31ea70117ef2db04a33632c0142f","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-pyspark-grouped-apply-in-arrow","ref":"branch-pyspark-grouped-apply-in-arrow","sha":"5191137bc2fa31ea70117ef2db04a33632c0142f","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose throw `SparkRuntimeException` with error class `STREAM_FAILED` instead of `INTERNAL_ERROR` when a stream failed due to an exception in user code, and bypass `SparkThrowable` w/o wrapping it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow users to debug their queries easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionAnsiErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of both https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38468 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38612 that proposes to deduplicate codes in `ArrowConverters` by creating two classes `ArrowBatchIterator` and `ArrowBatchWithSchemaIterator`.  In addition, we reuse `ArrowBatchWithSchemaIterator` when creating an empty Arrow batch at `createEmptyArrowBatch`.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here,\r\n- I addressed my own comment at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38612#discussion_r1019838326\r\n- Kept the support of both max rows and size. Max row size check was removed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38612\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better readability and maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, both codes are not related.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is refactoring so existing CI should cover.","created_at":"2022-11-11T07:06:11Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:08Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T10:12:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a29a6e5eb62db5780ee7a5d5d067b466e1cb50bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf2de76582114658cd5983b5e305afd42257440f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41108-followup-1","ref":"SPARK-41108-followup-1","sha":"cf2de76582114658cd5983b5e305afd42257440f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38468 that proposes to remove notify-wait approach, and introduce a new way to collect partitions in parallel, and send them in order.\r\n\r\n- Previously, it actually waits until all results are stored all first, and then send them one by one in Protobuf message; (therefore, notify-wait isn't needed in fact).\r\n\r\n    Both worse and best cases, we will always collect all partitions first and send them partition by partition.\r\n\r\n- Now, it sends Protobuf messages in an order whenever 0th partition is available (and send the next if available).\r\n\r\n    Worse case, we will collect all partitions and send them one by one. Best case is to send partition by partition as it's collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better performance, less memory usage, and better readability and maintinability (by removing synchronization) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this feature is not released yet, and this is performance only fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it out.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-11T04:22:48Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:08Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T12:11:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ccb455cff7901669df756fa817b94fa2d785880","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7268303238034d84004aca5570265c1a65e3c902","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41005-followup","ref":"SPARK-41005-followup","sha":"7268303238034d84004aca5570265c1a65e3c902","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to reduce collection conversion when create AttributeMap as following ways:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new `apply` method to `AttributeMap`\r\n\r\n```\r\n  def apply[A](kvs: Iterable[(Attribute, A)]): AttributeMap[A] = {\r\n    new AttributeMap(kvs.map(kv => (kv._1.exprId, kv)).toMap)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use it in applicable scenarios to avoid additional collection conversion.\r\n\r\nAlthough the new `apply` method is more generic, I did not delete the old ones for forward compatibility.\r\n\r\n2. For the following 2 scenarios, `leftStats.attributeStats ++ rightStats.attributeStats` is `AttributeMap ++ AttributeMap`, will return a new `AttributeMap`, so this pr remove the redundant collection conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7d320d784a2d637fd1a8fd0798da3d2a39b4d7cd/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/statsEstimation/JoinEstimation.scala#L86\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7d320d784a2d637fd1a8fd0798da3d2a39b4d7cd/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/statsEstimation/JoinEstimation.scala#L148\r\n\r\n3. For the following scenario, `attributePercentiles` is a `Map` and there is a corresponding `apply` method can accept `Map` input, so remove the redundant `toSeq` in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new profile named `-Puser-defined-protoc` to support that users can build and test `connect` module by specifying custom `protoc` and `protoc-gen-grpc-java` executables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs described in SPARK-40593, the latest versions of `protoc` and `protoc-gen-grpc-java` have the minimum version requirements for basic libraries such as `glibc` and `glibcxx`. Because of that it is not possible to compile the `connect `module out of the box on CentOS 6 or CentOS 7. Instead the following error messages is shown:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] PROTOC FAILED: /home/disk0/spark-source/connect/target/protoc-plugins/protoc-3.21.1-linux-x86_64.exe: /lib64/libc.so.6: version

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the way to using official pre-release  `protoc` and `protoc-gen-grpc-java` binary files is activated by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual test on CentOS6u3 and CentOS7u4\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport CONNECT_PROTOC_EXEC_PATH=/path-to-protoc-exe\r\nexport

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe used to wrap those fields into messages to acquire the ability to tell if those field is set or unset. It turns out proto3 offers built-in mechanism to achieve the same thing: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#specifying_field_rules.\r\n\r\nIt is as easy as adding `optional` keyword to the field to auto-generate `hasXXX` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors existing proto to get rid of redundant message definitions.   \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCodebase simplification. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the past, Connect server side separates `Command` and `Relation` into two Planners. However, as we are adding new API, there are certainly cases that a `Command` still has an input which is a Relation. Thus when converting `Command`, it still needs to access the logic of converting `Relation`. View creation is an example of such cases. Usually DDL and DML of SQL will also follow.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors to merge the logic of dealing with `Command` and `Relation` into the same planner.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRefactoring. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNO\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExceptions thrown in `SparkHadoopWriter.write` are wrapped with `SparkException(\"Job aborted.\"), which provides little extra information, but generates a long stacktrace and make the debugging process more difficult.\r\n\r\nThis change removes the wrapping.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to simplify the stacktrace when errors are thrown in `SparkHadoopWriter.write`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWhen exceptions are thrown in `SparkHadoopWriter.write`, the wrapping with `SparkExceptions` will be removed and the stacktrace will be simplified.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`Dataset.createTempView` allows  view  creation with name in the format of `db_name.view_name`. However temp view does not belong to a DB so this is unexpected behavior. It confuses users that they might think temp view can have DB. Also later when they call `spark.catalog.tableExists(\"db_name.view_name\")`, it will report view not found.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes\r\n1. a conf to control whether we allow view creation with db name as prefix in view name (by default is we do not allow).\r\n2. If we do not allow, throw a proper exception (which re-use error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_0054` but rename it to a proper name).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to make build/mvn use the same JAVA_OPTS as dev/make-distribution.sh to speed up mvn build.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this pr deletes the duplicate `-Xmx4g` option  from `make-distribution.sh`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo speed up mvn build.\r\n\r\nRun the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean -Phadoop-3 -Phadoop-cloud -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkinesis-asl -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pkubernetes -Phive -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -Phadoop-3 -Phadoop-cloud -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkinesis-asl -Phive-thriftserver -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pkubernetes -Phive -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n- x86 Linux: `[INFO] Total time:  01:22 h ([INFO] Spark Project Examples

SUCCESS [01:22 min])`\r\n- M1 MacOs: `[INFO] Total time:  25:14 min ([INFO] Spark Project Examples ............................. SUCCESS [01:08 min])`\r\n\r\nFrom above result, new JAVA_OPTS reduce mvn build time by 65%+\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nConnect python client uses `ColumnRef` to represent columns in API (e.g. `df.name`). Current PySpark uses `Class Column` for the same thing. In this case, we can align Connect with PySpark, which can help existing PySpark users to reuse their code for Spark Connect python client as much as possible (minimize the code change).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to help existing PySpark users to reuse their code for Spark Connect python client as much as possible (minimize the code change).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement PySpark memory profiling on executors. The feature is enabled via a newly-introduced Spark configuration `spark.python.profile.memory`.\r\n\r\nSee more [design.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR2K4TdrM1eAjNDC1bsflCNRH67UWLoC-lCv6TSUVXD91Ruksm99pYTnCeIm7Ui3RgrrRNcQU_D8-oh/pub)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are many factors in a PySpark program’s performance. Memory, as one of the key factors of a program’s performance, had been missing in PySpark profiling. A PySpark program on the Spark driver can be profiled with [Memory Profiler](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1668027860192689&usg=AOvVaw1t4LRcObEGuhaTr5oHEUwU) as a normal Python process, but there was not an easy way to profile memory on Spark executors.\r\n\r\nPySpark UDFs, one of the most popular Python APIs, enable users to run custom code on top of the Apache Spark™ engine. However, it is difficult to optimize UDFs without understanding memory consumption.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to introduce the PySpark memory profiler, which profiles memory on executors. It provides information about total memory usage and pinpoints which lines of code in a UDF attribute to the most memory usage. That will help optimize PySpark UDFs and reduce the likelihood of out-of-memory errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo changes to existing user-facing behaviors.\r\n\r\nA Spark configuration `spark.python.profile.memory` is introduced to enable the PySpark memory profiling feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit tests.\r\n- Manual tests on Jupyter notebooks as shown below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47337188/200998618-73eb5bd1-83ba-4256-9ba4-f6fb4afcd1bd.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-09T18:30:04Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T02:59:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T02:59:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"677ed3cd79843cf9c7315ecf68cd4a95520a402b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02b9dfb035fe265021b0933132ba13c87a4a33b4","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:memory_profile","ref":"memory_profile","sha":"02b9dfb035fe265021b0933132ba13c87a4a33b4","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current antlr-based SQL parser is pretty fragile due to the fact that we make the antlr parser rule pretty flexible and push more parsing logic to the Scala side (`AstBuilder`). A tiny change to the antlr parser rule may break the parser unexpectedly. As an example, in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38404 , we added a new parser rule to extend the INSERT syntax, and it breaks interval literal. `select b + interval '1 month' from values (1, 1)` can't be parsed after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38404\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the interval literal parser rule stricter. Now it lists all the allowed interval units instead of matching an identifier. This fixes the issue we hit in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38404 .\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can revisit other parser rules and try to rely on antlr more to do the parsing work.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix parser issues we hit in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38404 \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe error message is changed a little bit for `SELECT INTERVAL 1 wrong_unit`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to interpret the `unresolved operator` issue as an internal error, and throw `SparkException` w/ the error class `INTERNAL_ERROR`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe issues that leads to `unresolved operator` should be solved earlier w/ proper user-facing errors. If we reach the point when we cannot resolve an operator, we should interpret this as Spark SQL internal error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, in most regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected and modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename `UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_REFERENCE` to `CORRELATED_REFERENCE`.\r\n\r\nAlso, show `sqlExprs` rather than `treeNode` which is more useful information to users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe sub-error class name is duplicated with its main class, `UNSUPPORTED_SUBQUERY_EXPRESSION_CATEGORY`.\r\n\r\nWe should make the all error class name clear and briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere's a problem with submitting spark jobs to K8s cluster: the library generates and reuses the same name for config maps (for drivers and executors). Ideally, for each job 2 config maps should be created: for a driver and an executor. However, the library creates only one driver config map for all jobs (in some cases it generates only one executor map for all jobs in the same manner). So, if I run 5 jobs, then only one driver config map will be generated and used for every job. During those runs we experience issues when deleting pods from the cluster: executors pods are endlessly created and immediately terminated overloading cluster resources.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs because of the **KubernetesClientUtils** class in which we have **configMapNameExecutor** and **configMapNameDriver** as constants. It seems to be incorrect and should be urgently fixed. I've prepared some changes for review to fix the issue (turned the constants into the methods) (tested in the cluster of our project).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the spark submitter generate new names for driver and executor config maps to let jobs complete successfully, not overloading cluster resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nExecutors pods should stop being generated and terminated endlessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the unit tests in the module. Tested with the unit tests and by submitting jobs to the K8S cluster of our project.","created_at":"2022-11-09T03:46:50Z","updated_at":"2023-03-12T00:21:07Z","closed_at":"2023-03-12T00:21:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f29cd51326299683059e503b1b4c11e8c8554c8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a62f710dee2a5533b64a932b2fdda46b83d26aa","head":{"label":"19Serhii99:bug/SPARK-41060","ref":"bug/SPARK-41060","sha":"4a62f710dee2a5533b64a932b2fdda46b83d26aa","user":{"login":"19Serhii99","id":70665279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjY1Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70665279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99","html_url":"https://github.com/19Serhii99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":563575495,"node_id":"R_kgDOIZd6xw","name":"spark","full_name":"19Serhii99/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"19Serhii99","id":70665279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjY1Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70665279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99","html_url":"https://github.com/19Serhii99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/19Serhii99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/19Serhii99/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to keep the `R_LIBS_SITE` as was. It has been changed from R 4.2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the behaviour same as the previous. This especially affects the external libraries installed in SparkR worker sides. Especially this can break the user-installed libraries. See the paths below:\r\n\r\n**R 4.2**\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# R\r\n> Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_SITE\")\r\n[1] \"/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/:/usr/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/library'\"\r\n# R --vanilla\r\n> Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_SITE\")\r\n[1] \"/usr/lib/R/site-library\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R 4.1**\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# R\r\n> Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_SITE\")\r\n[1] \"/usr/local/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/library\"\r\n# R --vanilla\r\n> Sys.getenv(\"R_LIBS_SITE\")\r\n[1] \"/usr/local/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/library\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. With R 4.2, user-installed libraries won't be found in SparkR workers.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, unittest added. It's difficult to add an e2e tests.\r\n\r\nI also manually tested `getROptions` in Scala

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport using RocksDB as the KVStore in live UI. The location of RocksDB can be set via configuration `spark.ui.store.path`. The configuration is optional. The default KV store will still be in memory.\r\n\r\nNote: let's make it ROCKSDB only for now instead of supporting both LevelDB and RocksDB. RocksDB is built based on LevelDB with improvements on writes and reads. Furthermore, we can reuse the RocksDBFileManager in streaming for replicating the local RocksDB file to DFS. The replication in DFS can be used for the Spark history server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current architecture of Spark live UI and Spark history server(SHS) is too simple to serve large clusters and heavy workloads:\r\n\r\n- Spark stores all the live UI date in memory. The size can be a few GBs and affects the driver's stability (OOM). \r\n- There is a limitation of storing 1000 queries only. Note that we can’t simply increase the limitation under the current Architecture. I did a memory profiling. Storing one query execution detail can take 800KB while storing one task requires 0.3KB. So for 1000 SQL queries with 1000* 2000 tasks, the memory usage for query execution and task data will be 1.4GB. Spark UI stores UI data for jobs/stages/executors as well.  So to store 10k queries, it may take more than 14GB.\r\n- SHS has to parse JSON format event log for the initial start.  The uncompressed event logs can be as big as a few GBs, and the parse can be quite slow. Some users reported they had to wait for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\nWith RocksDB as KVStore, we can improve the stability of Spark driver and fasten the startup of SHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, supporting RocksDB as the KVStore in live UI. The location of RocksDB can be set via configuration `spark.ui.store.path`. The configuration is optional. The default KV store will still be in memory.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\nPreview of the doc change:\r\n<img width=\"895\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`RewriteDistinctAggregates` doesn't typically patch foldable children of the distinct aggregation functions except in one odd case (and seemingly by accident). This PR extends the policy of not patching foldables to that odd case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query produces incorrect results:\r\n```\r\nselect a, count(distinct 100) as cnt1, count(distinct b, 100) as cnt2\r\nfrom values (1, 2), (4, 5) as data(a, b)\r\ngroup by a;\r\n\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n|a  |cnt1|cnt2|\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n|1  |1   |0   |\r\n|4  |1   |0   |\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n```\r\nThe values for `cnt2` should be 1 and 1 (not 0 and 0).\r\n\r\nIf you change the literal used in the first aggregate function, the second aggregate function now works correctly:\r\n```\r\nselect a, count(distinct 101) as cnt1, count(distinct b, 100) as cnt2\r\nfrom values (1, 2), (4, 5) as data(a, b)\r\ngroup by a;\r\n\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n|a  |cnt1|cnt2|\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n|1  |1   |1   |\r\n|4  |1   |1   |\r\n+---+----+----+\r\n```\r\nThe bug is in the rule `RewriteDistinctAggregates`. When a distinct aggregation has only foldable children, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` uses the first child as the grouping key (_grouping key_ in this context means the function children of distinct aggregate functions: `RewriteDistinctAggregates` groups distinct aggregations by function children to determine the `Expand` projections  it needs to create). Therefore, the first foldable child gets included in the `Expand` projection associated with the aggregation, with a corresponding output attribute that is also included in the map for patching aggregate functions in the final aggregation.\r\n\r\nThe `Expand` projections for all other distinct aggregate groups will have `null` in the slot associated with that output attribute. If the same foldable expression is used in a distinct aggregation associated with a different group, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` will improperly patch the associated aggregate function to use the previous aggregation's output attribute. Since the output attribute is associated with a different group, the value of that slot in the `Expand` projection will always be `null`.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, `count(distinct 100) as cnt1` is the aggregation with only foldable children, and `count(distinct b, 100) as cnt2` is the aggregation that gets inappropriately patched with the wrong group's output attribute. As a result `count(distinct b, 100) as cnt2` (from the first example above) essentially becomes `count(distinct b, null) as cnt2`, which is always zero.\r\n\r\n`RewriteDistinctAggregates` doesn't typically patch foldable children of the distinct aggregation functions in the final aggregation. It potentially patches foldable expressions only when there is a distinct aggregation with only foldable children, and even then it doesn't patch the aggregation that has only foldable children, but instead some other unlucky aggregate function that happened to use the same foldable expression.\r\n\r\nThis PR skips patching any foldable expressions in the aggregate functions to avoid patching an aggregation with a different group's output attribute.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-08T20:24:34Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T02:40:17Z","closed_at":"2022-11-09T01:29:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"472b4aa69f5e3a16df6016cb92afc47abfb859ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9d4008d94f2f918206a13be4359d12c9e95bccca","head":{"label":"bersprockets:distinct_literal_issue","ref":"distinct_literal_issue","sha":"9d4008d94f2f918206a13be4359d12c9e95bccca","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

It does 3 things:\r\n1. run `OptimizeSubqueries` in the batch `PartitionPruning`, so that `RowLevelOperationRuntimeGroupFiltering` does not need to invoke it manually.\r\n2. skip dpp subquery in `OptimizeSubqueries`, to avoid the issue fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33664\r\n3. `RowLevelOperationRuntimeGroupFiltering` creates `InSubquery` instead of `DynamicPruningSubquery`, so that it can be optimized by `OptimizeSubqueries` later. This also avoids unnecessary planning overhead of `DynamicPruningSubquery`, as there is no join and we can only run it as a subquery.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently when `ScalaReflection` returns a deserializer, for a few complex types, such as array, map, udt, etc, it creates functions that may still touch `ScalaReflection` after the deserializer is created.\r\n\r\n`ScalaReflection` is a performance bottleneck for multiple threads as it holds multiple global locks. We can refactor `ScalaReflection.deserializerFor` to pre-compute everything that needs to touch `ScalaReflection` before creating the deserializer. After this, once the deserializer is created, it can be reused by multiple threads without touching `ScalaReflection.deserializerFor` any more and it will be much faster.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptimize `ScalaReflection.deserializerFor` to make deserializers faster under multiple threads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is refactoring `deserializerFor` to optimize the code. Existing tests should already cover the correctness.","created_at":"2022-11-08T06:42:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T16:19:39Z","closed_at":"2022-11-08T16:19:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e0dfa4e512a53b59a87501578a719c4aa372be5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42f796bfc9886c24ded93cbb41290a178400ec7a","head":{"label":"zsxwing:scala-ref","ref":"scala-ref","sha":"42f796bfc9886c24ded93cbb41290a178400ec7a","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36963 added a check to disallow any source setting `CatalogTable` in the batch plan. However, this check is not safe to enforce:\r\n\r\n- In a self-union query, the batch plan created by the source will be shared by multiple nodes in the plan. When we transform the plan, the batch plan will be visited multiple times. Hence, the first visit will set the `CatalogTable` and the second visit will try to set it again and fail the query.\r\n- A source built by arbitrary developers can set `CatalogTable` in the batch plan. We should not fail as it would break an existing source.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by removing the check and set `CatalogTable` only if the batch plan doesn't have one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a bug in master.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added unit

needed?\r\n\r\nThe current error class name `MULTI_VALUE_SUBQUERY_ERROR` is not clear enough to brief the error situation.\r\n\r\n`SCALAR_SUBQUERY_TOO_MANY_ROWS` would be more readable since the \"scalar subquery\" is the industrial term.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt \"sql/testOnly
