For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

This allows you to do e.g.:</p>\n<p>await.forever until { .. }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added shortcut for enabling logging. Before you had to do e.g.</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info))\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>You can now instead use the &quot;logging&quot; shortcut:</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.logging(log::info)\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>or simply &quot;.logging()&quot; for &quot;System.out&quot;.</p>\n<p>This shortcut has also been added globally:</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setLogging(log::info);</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setDefaultLogging();</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved lambda detection for Java 17 and Java 21</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy to 4.0.19</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/ff13b724c45853c3becbec988a1447ac2508762d\"><code>ff13b72</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/f80c2996d96c81b203f0483a55adfcc200c2963c\"><code>f80c299</code></a> [ci skip] Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/4be5236649ef6b16e805137fa7be404ce4db3e09\"><code>4be5236</code></a> [ci skip] Fixed typo in changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/e15b97560d873a7a632dc7cfaabff6d2fea92f50\"><code>e15b975</code></a> Fixed failing tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/7f7656e48377739cc41afdc60bf8f3c47135b196\"><code>7f7656e</code></a> Adding 17 and 21 to tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/32eafb69b38ff87ba4fae8b133e0ccc9ffa1a126\"><code>32eafb6</code></a> Improved lambda detection and upgraded groovy/scala</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/801293612b7a608d5e8c8ddce24b1398cdc4d2fe\"><code>8012936</code></a> Trying to fix failing test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/b01855d944d96d072e4e760e1f81afb78d12afe7\"><code>b01855d</code></a> Revert &quot;Added java 21 tests&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/0e7dff0f0f36d50a88379ca810496ed91123aa83\"><code>0e7dff0</code></a> Revert &quot;Revert &quot;Use Duration factories in Durations.java (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/268\">#268</a>)&quot;&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/97076a9acea3b6c3a07eda72a52bfdc6a4df6200\"><code>97076a9</code></a> Added java 21 tests</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/compare/awaitility-4.2.0...awaitility-4.2.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.awaitility:awaitility&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.2.0&new-version=4.2.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action.

<code>HashMap</code>\nwhen the keys are of an enum type. The specialized enum collections are more space- and time-efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>💥 pmd-compat6 removed (breaking)</h4>\n<p>The already deprecated PMD 6 compatibility module (pmd-compat6) has been removed. It was intended to be used with\nolder versions of the maven-pmd-plugin, but since maven-pmd-plugin 3.22.0, PMD 7 is supported directly and this\nmodule is not needed anymore.</p>\n<p>If you currently use this dependency (<code>net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-compat6</code>), remove it and upgrade maven-pmd-plugin\nto the latest version (3.23.0 or newer).</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.3.0/pmd_userdocs_tools_maven.html\">Maven PMD Plugin</a>.</p>\n<h3>🐛 Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>cli\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2827\">#2827</a>: [cli] Consider processing errors in exit status</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>core\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4396\">#4396</a>: [core] CPD is always case sensitive</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4992\">#4992</a>: [core] CPD: Include processing errors in XML report</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5066\">#5066</a>: [core] CPD throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space (since 7.1.0)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Java rule <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.3.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#useenumcollections\"><code>UseEnumCollections</code></a> reports usages for <code>HashSet</code> and <code>HashMap</code>\nwhen the keys are of an enum type. The specialized enum collections are more space- and time-efficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>💥 pmd-compat6 removed (breaking)</h4>\n<p>The already deprecated PMD 6 compatibility module (pmd-compat6) has been removed. It was intended to be used with\nolder versions of the maven-pmd-plugin, but since maven-pmd-plugin 3.22.0, PMD 7 is supported directly and this\nmodule is not needed anymore.</p>\n<p>If you currently use this dependency (<code>net.sourceforge.pmd:pmd-compat6</code>), remove it and upgrade maven-pmd-plugin\nto the latest version (3.23.0 or newer).</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.3.0/pmd_userdocs_tools_maven.html\">Maven PMD Plugin</a>.</p>\n<h3>🐛 Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>cli\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/2827\">#2827</a>: [cli] Consider processing errors in exit status</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>core\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4396\">#4396</a>: [core] CPD is always case sensitive</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4992\">#4992</a>: [core] CPD: Include processing errors in XML report</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5066\">#5066</a>: [core] CPD throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space (since 7.1.0)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 7.0.1</h2>\n<p>We have just released version 7.0.1 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk\">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a>. It is available for download from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/\">SourceForge</a>, and it is available in the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/7.0.1\">Maven Central Repository</a>. You can find the release notes for this release (and all previous versions) at <a href=\"https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html\">https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html</a>, but here’s a summary of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>MaximumIdleDurationLDAPConnectionPoolHealthCheck</code> class that can be used to replace connections that have remained idle for longer than a specified length of time. We generally recommend setting a maximum connection age for the pool so that connections are automatically replaced after a given amount of time regardless of their activity, but the new health check can be used as an alternative if you want to keep active connections around as long as possible while also ensuring that idle connections are closed by the LDAP SDK before they might be closed by the LDAP server or by intermediate network equipment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the in-memory directory server to improve its concurrency when processing operations that don’t need to make changes to the data, including binds, searches, and compares.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added new <code>Filter.createSubstringAssertion</code> methods that can be used to create properly encoded string representations of substring assertions. This can be particularly helpful when you want to create an extensible matching filter using a substring matching rule.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>KeyStoreKeyManager</code> and <code>TrustStoreTrustManager</code> classes to make it possible to use an alternative security provider when accessing the associated key or trust store. We’ve also made it possible to indicate whether the LDAP SDK should be allowed to access non-FIPS-compliant key stores when operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We fixed an issue in which the <code>parallel-update</code> tool would use an in-memory buffer to hold information about information to write to the reject file, but it would not automatically flush that buffer when changes are rejected. In some cases, this could introduce a significant delay between the time that a change is rejected and the time that a record of it was written to the specified log file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We fixed an issue with the <code>manage-certificates</code> tool that could prevent it from accessing the JVM’s default trust store in cases where the LDAP SDK is operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode and the tool is invoked programmatically (as opposed to running it from the command line).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the command-line tool framework to make it possible for tools to expose arguments for generating a debug log file. All of the tools included with the LDAP SDK have been updated to provide this option, and you can use the <code>--help-debug</code> argument to see the applicable arguments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the debug logging framework to make it possible to write debug messages, which are formatted as JSON objects, using a multi-line representation rather than the default single-line representation. People looking at the log messages may find the multi-line format easier to read.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>StaticUtils.setSystemPropertyIfNotAlreadyDefined</code> method that can be used to set the value of a specified system property in the JVM, but only if it’s not already set (in which case its current value will be preserved).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added client-side support for a new “verify password” extended request in the Ping Identity Directory Server that properly authorized clients (under a restricted set of circumstances) can use to determine whether a given password is valid for a specified user without performing any other password policy processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the OID registry to include records for a number of collation matching rules supported in the Ping Identity Directory Server, ForgeRock OpenDJ, Oracle OUD, and other servers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/blob/master/docs/release-notes.html\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>          &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDAP SDK Home Page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Product Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;h2&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\n<pre><code>      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Version 7.0.1&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n        The following changes were made between the 7.0.0 and 7.0.1 releases:\n      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added a new LDAP connection pool health check that can be used to replace\n          connections that have remained idle for longer than a specified length of time.\n          This is primarily useful in cases where the associated directory servers (or\n          intermediate networking equipment) may terminate connections that have remained\n          idle for too long.  Note that in connection pools that may contain connections\n          across multiple servers, you should probably set a maximum connection age for the\n          pool rather than using this health check, as this will better allow the pool to\n          return to a balanced state more quickly after a failure has caused connections to\n          migrate away from one or more servers.  Also note that health checks that attempt\n          to actually communicate with the associated server over LDAP may be preferred\n          over this health check because not only will they do a better job of ensuring\n          that connections are actually usable, but the communication that they perform\n          will also prevent the connections from being seen as idle.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the in-memory directory server to improve its concurrency when performing\n          operations that don't need to make changes to the data.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added createSubstringAssertion methods to the filter class, which make it easier\n          to construct the string representation of a substring assertion with a given\n          combination of subInitial, subAny, and/or subFinal elements.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>.

be exposed to XPath, as long as the return type was a primitive (boxed or unboxed), String or Enum. That meant that collections, even of these basic types, were not exposed, so for instance accessing Apex's <code>ASTUserClass.getInterfaceNames()</code> to list the interfaces implemented by a class was impossible from XPath, and would require writing a Java rule to check it.</p>\n<p>Since this release, PMD will also expose any getter returning a collection of any supported type as a sequence through an XPath attribute. They would require to use apropriate XQuery functions to manipulate the sequence. So for instance, to detect any given <code>ASTUserClass</code> in Apex that implements <code>Queueable</code>, it is now possible to write:</p>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>/UserClass[@InterfaceNames = 'Queueable']\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Updated PMD Designer</h4>\n<p>This PMD release ships a new version of the pmd-designer.\nFor the changes, see <a href=\"https://github.com/pmd/pmd-designer/releases/tag/7.2.0\">PMD Designer Changelog (7.2.0)</a>.</p>\n<h3>🐛 Fixed Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4467\">#4467</a>: [core] Expose collections from getters as XPath sequence attributes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4978\">#4978</a>: [core] Referenced Rulesets do not emit details on validation errors</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4983\">#4983</a>: [cpd] Fix CPD crashes about unicode escapes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5009\">#5009</a>: [core] Kotest tests aren't picked up by surefire</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>java\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4912\">#4912</a>: [java] Unable to parse some Java9+ resource references</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4973\">#4973</a>: [java] Stop parsing Java for CPD</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4980\">#4980</a>: [java] Bad intersection, unrelated class types java.lang.Object[] and java.lang.Number</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/4988\">#4988</a>: [java] Fix impl of ASTVariableId::isResourceDeclaration / VariableId/@<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ResourceDeclaration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/4990\">#4990</a>: [java] Add an attribute @<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PackageQualifier to ASTClassType</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5006\">#5006</a>: [java] Bad intersection, unrelated class types Child and Parent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/5029\">#5029</a>: [java] PMD 7.x throws stack overflow in TypeOps$ProjectionVisitor while parsing a Java class</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

be exposed to XPath, as long as the return type was a primitive (boxed or unboxed), String or Enum. That meant that collections, even of these basic types, were not exposed, so for instance accessing Apex's <code>ASTUserClass.getInterfaceNames()</code> to list the interfaces implemented by a class was impossible from XPath, and would require writing a Java rule to check it.</p>\n<p>Since this release, PMD will also expose any getter returning a collection of any supported type as a sequence through an XPath attribute. They would require to use apropriate XQuery functions to manipulate the sequence.

and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>. ARM machines with SIP disabled, including the newest <code>macos-latest</code> image, are unsupported for CLI versions before 2.15.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2261\">#2261</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.2 - 22 Apr 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.1 - 17 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in April/May 2024 that improves the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where the <code>init</code> Action would fail if <code>--overwrite</code> was specified in <code>CODEQL_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTIONS</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2245\">#2245</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.0 - 15 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The deprecated feature for extracting dependencies for a Python analysis has been removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2224\">#2224</a></p>\n<p>As a result, the following inputs and environment variables are now ignored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>setup-python-dependencies</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action</li>\n<li>The <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION</code> environment variable</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

[com.google.code.gson:gson](https://github.com/google/gson) from 2.10.1 to 2.11.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/releases\">com.google.code.gson:gson's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gson-parent-2.11.0</h2>\n<h1>Most important changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Added default ProGuard / R8 rules (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2397\">#2397</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2420\">#2420</a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/sgjesse\"><code>@​sgjesse</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2448\">#2448</a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/sfreilich\"><code>@​sfreilich</code></a>)<br />\nIf you are using ProGuard or R8 (for example for Android projects) you might not need any special Gson configuration anymore if your classes have a no-args constructor and use <code>@SerializedName</code> for their fields.</li>\n<li>On Android, Gson now requires API level 21 or newer</li>\n<li>Added new <code>Strictness</code> API (<a href=\"https://github.com/marten-voorberg\"><code>@​marten-voorberg</code></a> &amp; fellow students, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2437\">#2437</a>)<br />\nSome of Gson's API is still lenient by default, but you can now use the newly added methods <code>GsonBuilder#setStrictness</code>, <code>JsonReader#setStrictness</code> and <code>JsonWriter#setStrictness</code> with <code>Strictness.STRICT</code> to override this behavior and to instead strictly adhere to the JSON specification when parsing.</li>\n<li>New <code>FormattingStyle</code> class to allow configuring line breaks in JSON output (<a href=\"https://github.com/mihnita\"><code>@​mihnita</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2231\">#2231</a>)<br />\nCan be set using <code>GsonBuilder#setFormattingStyle</code> and <code>JsonWriter#setFormattingStyle</code>.</li>\n<li><code>TypeToken</code> can no longer capture type variables by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2376\">#2376</a>)<br />\nThis was previously a common source of issues. The newly thrown exception refers to a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md#typetoken-type-variable\">Troubleshooting Guide article</a> which explains this in more detail and provides suggestions for updating affected code.</li>\n<li>Added serialization support for anonymous and local classes with a custom adapter (<a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/gson/issues/2498\">#2498</a>)<br />\nThis affects for example <code>List</code> implementations returned by libraries such as Guava which are implemented as anonymous class, which were previously serialized as <code>null</code>. Anonymous and local classes without custom adapter will still be serialized as <code>null</code>.</li>\n<li>Added dependency on <code>com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations</code><br />\nThis dependency can be considered optional, but if missing it might lead to compiler warnings.

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>. ARM machines with SIP disabled, including the newest <code>macos-latest</code> image, are unsupported for CLI versions before 2.15.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2261\">#2261</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.2 - 22 Apr 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.1 - 17 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in April/May 2024 that improves the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where the <code>init</code> Action would fail if <code>--overwrite</code> was specified in <code>CODEQL_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTIONS</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2245\">#2245</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.0 - 15 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The deprecated feature for extracting dependencies for a Python analysis has been removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2224\">#2224</a></p>\n<p>As a result, the following inputs and environment variables are now ignored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>setup-python-dependencies</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action</li>\n<li>The <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION</code> environment variable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend removing any references to these from your workflows.
