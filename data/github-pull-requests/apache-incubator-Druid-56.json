Description\r\n\r\nFixes a bug which shows up in specific deployments, that use k8s based discovery module, where `druid.host` gets set to something more than 63 characters which is the max length limit on kubernetes label values.\r\n\r\nCurrently we put full `host:port` as a k8s label inside pod spec, which can be of arbitrary length. This patch changes node discovery mechanism to work with a hash of `host:port` in the label value instead.\r\n\r\nIt is the (2) issue described in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10752#issuecomment-760547707 . Since this issue will be encountered by users quickly so hoping to have this included in 0.21.0 release.\r\n\r\nPS: Existing [unit/integration] tests cover the changes made here. It would further be exercised in a larger PR that introduces leader election improvements and integration tests similar to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10680 would be done later, that is blocked on a new release from kubernetes java client lib we use, that contains few leader election algorithm improvements.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR improves IT to reduce excessive stack trace messages when waiting Druid nodes to start up.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running IT, Druid nodes are started up in K8S environment, and IT test cases will wait for Druid nodes to start up by checking their HTTP endpoint '/status/health' periodically.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, nodes in K8S environment take some time to start up, and this causes the periodical check mentioned above outputs a lot of disturbing and very long stack trace messages shown as below\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-03-08T04:18:13,937 INFO [main]

PR is a replacement for #10418 . \r\n\r\nThe core changes at the server side in #10418 has been implemented in #10680, and based on that implementation,  a `is_leader` column is added to 'servers' table which means user could know which nodes are playing in a role of leader by querying 'servers' table.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a more convenient, intuitive way for users to get leader information - by showing the information in 'Details' column under 'Services' tab.

#10702\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #10702 by adding support to doubleFirst/floatFirst/longFirst and doubleLast/floatLast/longLast during ingestion phase. And also reverts #10794 to bring back the UI.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is inspired by current stringFirst/stringLast implementation, so the code looks like similar. But this PR does not refactor current stringFirst/stringLast implementation to share the code with double/float/long. That might be done in the future.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AbstractSerializableLongObjectPairSerde` is provided to share serialization code for type of long/double/float\r\n * `GenericFirstAggregateCombiner` is provided to share first aggregator code for type of long/double/float\r\n * `GenericLastAggregateCombiner` is provided to share last aggregator code for type of long/double/float\r\n\r\n#### What's not included in this PR\r\n1. `stringFirst`/`stringLast` should also share the three base classes listed above, I will open a new PR to do this to keep changes in this PR as less as possible.\r\n2. SQL query on re-indexed columns with double/float/long first and last aggregators WON'T work. This involves some changes in complex type handling which might be better in another PR.\r\n\r\n#### Test Scenario\r\n\r\nThis PR contains UT and IT cases to cover all `doubleFirst`/`doubleLast`, `floatFirst`/`floatLast`, `longFirst`/`longLast` aggregators, including:\r\n- buffer aggregation\r\n- aggregate combiner\r\n- serdes\r\n- aggregation during index\r\n- aggregation during re-index\r\n- native query\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

ingested data has sparse columns, the ingested data with forceGuaranteedRollup=true can result in imperfect rollup and final dimension ordering can be different from dimensionSpec ordering in the ingestionSpec\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n**When does this problem happens:**\r\n\r\nThis can happens when we have sparse columns in the input data and a dimensionsSpec with dimension ordering that is not lexicographic. Note that this isn’t limited to Compaction but can also occurs in initial batch ingestion of data (index task).\r\n\r\n**Root cause:**\r\n\r\nThis bug occurs when all the dimensions in the intermediate segments does not have a common shared dimension ordering. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the dimensions of my data are “dimA”, “dimB” and “dimC”, where both “dimA” and “dimC” are sparse. During ingestion, the following intermediate segments are created:\r\n\r\nintermediate segment 1 has column “dimA” and “dimB”. It does not have “dimC” since “dimC” is sparse and does not exist in any rows of intermediate segment 1.\r\n\r\nintermediate segment 2 has column “dimB” and “dimC”. It does not have “dimA” since “dimA” is sparse and does not exist in any rows of intermediate segment 2.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to merge all the intermediate segments, we will not be able to find a shared common dimensions across all the intermediate segments (there is no intermediate segment with all “dimA”, “dimB” and “dimC” in it’s index. The current behavior would then fall back into merging all the intermediate segments with a lexicographic ordering of all the dimensions. The final merged segment will have the lexicographic ordering. This can be different than the dimension specified in the ingestionSpec if the dimension specified is not lexicographic ordering.\r\n\r\n**How this impact user:**\r\n\r\n**Impact 1: Segment size.** When a user specify a dimenionsSpec with ordering of dimension in the ingestionSpec, the ingestion task should creates segments with that ordering. The ordering matters as it impacts the segment size. Since this bug will results in a final segment with lexicographic ordering despite a dimenionsSpec (with ordering of dimension) in the ingestionSpec. \r\n\r\n**Impact 2: Roll up**. When a user specify forceGuaranteedRollup=true (with hash or single dim partitioning), the user expects perfect rollup. If a dimenionsSpec (with ordering of dimension) in the ingestionSpec is specified, that ordering is used to create the intermediate segments. However, because of this bug, the merging of all the intermediate segments would be done with a different ordering (lexicographic) assuming that the ordering in dimenionsSpec is not also lexicographic. This would result in imperfect roll up.\r\n\r\n**More detailed example + walkthrough of how the bug occurs:**\r\n\r\nLet’s say this is our input data\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"F\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"J\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1} **\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"Z\",\"dimB\":\"S\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1} **\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"Z\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"J\",\"dimB\":\"R\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"T\",\"metA\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1} **\r\n{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimC\":\"A\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}\r\n```\r\nThe `**` denotes row that should be roll up together.\r\n\r\nNow we will ingest/compact this with `dimB, dimA, dimC` order in the dimensionsSpec. \r\n\r\nNow lets say that the intermediate segments generated are:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nSegment 1: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"F\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 1: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"J\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 1: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}\r\n\r\nSegment 2: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"Z\",\"dimB\":\"S\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 2: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 2: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"Z\",\"metA\":1}\r\n\r\nSegment 3: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"J\",\"dimB\":\"R\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 3: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"T\",\"metA\":1}\r\nSegment 3: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}\r\n\r\nSegment 4: {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimC\":\"A\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}\r\n```\r\nand the indexes for these intermediate segments are:  \r\n\r\nNote that the ordering of dimensions here are important and that the ordering here follow the ordering of the dimension in the dimensionsSpec of the ingestionSpec (`dimB, dimA, dimC`)\r\n\r\nintermediate segments 1: dimB, dimA\r\nintermediate segments 2: dimB, dimA\r\nintermediate segments 3: dimB, dimA\r\nintermediate segments 4: dimB, dimC\r\n\r\nThe generated intermediate segments rows are sorted by dimension in the ordering of the  dimensionsSpec of the ingestionSpec (`dimB, dimA, dimC`). \r\n\r\nAt merging of the intermediate segments, `getLongestSharedDimOrder` returns `null` as there is no common shared dimension ordering across all 4 intermediate segments (none of the index have all dimA, dimB, and dimC). This causes the merging to be done with lexicographic ordering (`dimA, dimB, and dimC`). \r\n\r\nMerging of the intermediate segments iterates through all the indexes in like a BFS way. Basically, it would try to get everything for a given (time, dims) tuple from across all segments before moving to the next tuple. When it moved to the next tuple, it would assume that we are now on a different time, dims tuple. Hence, it is important that the intermediate segments are sorted with the dimension ordering that is used for merging.\r\n\r\nBack to our example, since we are now merging with lexicographic ordering (dimA, dimB, and dimC), the first row to be pulled is \r\n\r\n`{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimC\":\"A\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}`\r\n\r\nsince it first looks for the smallest value in dimA, follow by dimB, follow by dimC where null is treated as smallest across all the first rows of all the intermediate segments.\r\n\r\nthen it move on to \r\n\r\n` {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"F\",\"metA\":1}` (from intermediate segment 1) then\r\n\r\n`{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"C\",\"dimB\":\"J\",\"metA\":1}` (from intermediate segment 1) then\r\n\r\n`{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\",\"metA\":1}` (from intermediate segment 1) then\r\n\r\nSo far nothing is roll up as we haven’t gotten any (time, dims) tuple that are the same. We have now iterated through all the rows in intermediate segments 4 (first iteration) and intermediate segments 1 (second to fourth iterations). \r\n\r\nNow the next row to be iterate is either the first row of intermediate segments 2 (`{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"Z\",\"dimB\":\"S\",\"metA\":1}`) or the first row of intermediate segment 3 (`{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"J\",\"dimB\":\"R\",\"metA\":1}`). The problem here is that it should have iterate through the rows with `\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\"` in intermediate segment 2 and 3 first to be able to combine with the `\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"X\"` already iterated from intermediate segment 1. Just to complete the example, we then iterates `{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"J\",\"dimB\":\"R\",\"metA\":1} `(from intermediate segments 3) first since dimA value of J is smaller than dimA value of Z (from intermediate segments 2). Then we iterate the `{\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"H\",\"dimB\":\"T\",\"metA\":1} `(from intermediate segments 3) since dimA value of H is smaller than dimA value of Z (from intermediate segments 2). However, we can no longer roll up the row (from intermediate segments 3) with the previously iterated row from intermediate segments 1 since there was the` {\"time\":\"2015-09-12T00:46:58.771Z\",\"dimA\":\"J\",\"dimB\":\"R\",\"metA\":1}` in between which has dimA  != H and dimB != X values.\r\n\r\n**Purpose Fix:**\r\n\r\nHigh level: \r\nWe will make the dimension names given in the ingest spec available to getLongestShardeDimOrder (As an additional argument). \r\n\r\nWe should pass the `schema.getDimensionsSpec().getDimensionNames()` (which is the DimensionNames from the ingestionSpec) from within the `AppendetaorImpl#mergeAndPush` to `indexMerger.mergeQueryableIndex(...)` method. Which would then pass the DimensionNames to the `IndexMergerV9.merge` method. `IndexMergerV9.merge` would pass DimensionNames to the `IndexMerger.getMergedDimensions(indexes)` and finally, we pass it to `getLongestSharedDimOrder(...);`\r\n\r\nIn `getLongestSharedDimOrder(indexes, specDimensionNames)`, we would then try to find the LongestSharedDim as usually. However, if we cannot find the LongestSharedDim, before returning null, we will do the following in sequence:\r\n\r\n1. check if `specDimensionNames` is not null and not empty. → if null or empty, we return null\r\n2. get the `specDimensionNames` and remove all dimensions that does not exist within the `indexes` dimension names. \r\n3. check if `specDimensionNames` does not have extra / missing columns from the set of all `indexes` dimension names. → if it has extra/missing columns, we return null\r\n4. check that all `indexes` dimension name ordering is the same as the ordering in `specDimensionNames`. → if any index dimension name have a different ordering than `specDimensionNames` we return null.  For example, if `specDimensionNames` is A, B, C and one of the index dimension name is A, C then this is valid, however if one of the index dimension name is C, A then this is invalid and we return null \r\n5. return specDimensionNames\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

issue arises when matching against a long selector on the left-hand side to a string\r\ntyped Index on the right-hand side, and when that Index also returns true from areKeysUnique.\r\nIn this case, IndexedTableJoinMatcher would generate a ConditionMatcher that implements\r\nmatchSingleRow by calling findUniqueLong on the Index. This is inappropriate because the Index\r\nis actually string typed. The fix is to check the type of the Index before deciding how to\r\nimplement the ConditionMatcher.\r\n\r\nThe patch adds \"testMatchSingleRowToUniqueStringIndex\" to IndexedTableJoinMatcherTest,

Description\r\n\r\nBuilds on top of #10314 to add an integration test using a schema-registry docker container to test Apache Kafka + Apache Avro + Confluent Schema Registry secured with basic auth. This container only runs when the `kafka-data-format` integration test group is run.\r\n\r\nI also adjusted the parse method to distinguish failures to get the Avro schema from the registry from actual parse exceptions, since it seems like failure to get the schema would cause no messages to ever be parsable.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #10525 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFix the bug : incorrect results (including nulls) when querying string-array column(let's say it's `col`) with col <> '' and col is not null \r\n\r\nReason: When we use `is not null`  filter in SQL, Calcite will treat it  as `truefilter` through call stack as beflow:\r\n`DruidPlanner.plan(final String sql) -> PlannerImpl.rel(SqlNode sql) ->SqlToRelConverter.convertQuery(SqlNode query, boolean needsValidation, boolean top) ->SqlToRelConverter.convertQueryRecursive(SqlNode query, boolean top, RelDataType targetRowType)->SqlToRelConverter.convertSelect(SqlSelect select, boolean top) -> SqlToRelConverter.convertSelectImpl(SqlToRelConverter.Blackboard bb, SqlSelect select) -> SqlToRelConverter.convertWhere(SqlToRelConverter.Blackboard bb, SqlNode where) -> RexCall.isAlwaysTrue()-> AbstractSqlType.isNullable()`\r\n\r\nThe last method `AbstractSqlType.isNullable()` will return false in our arrayColumnType. Because in the method `Calcites.createSqlArrayTypeWithNullability()`, we only specify `nullable` praram for elementType in arrayColumnType,\r\nhowever, `typeFactory.createArrayType()` will invoke ` new ArraySqlType(elementType, false)` to return  a new RelDataType.\r\nThus, we will got  incorrect results (including nulls) when use `is not null`\r\n\r\nSolution: support specify  `nullable` praram for  arrayColumnType\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nImplements #9780\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee #9780 and linked discussions for more context. This PR adds a new module, `druid-spark`, containing Spark direct readers and writers for Druid. Usage is documented in the [module documentation](https://github.com/JulianJaffePinterest/druid/blob/spark_druid_connector/docs/development/spark.md). \r\n\r\nAs discussed on the [dev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r34bf70266d02ba14f7bcb1e449575d91d479373e40bc9cf3b3aa4999%40%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E), a summary in human language of the UX and testing regimen follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### UX\r\n\r\nThe entry point for users is deceptively simple: all interaction is handled through the existing spark interfaces plus configuration. To be specific, users read Druid data into a Spark dataframe via\r\n\r\n```\r\nDataset<Row> df = sparkSession\r\n  .read()\r\n  .format(\"druid\")\r\n  .schema(schema)\r\n  .options(propertiesMap)\r\n  .load();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand write a Spark dataframe to a Druid data source with\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf\r\n  .write()\r\n  .format(\"druid\")\r\n  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)\r\n  .options(propertiesMap)\r\n  .save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe meat of the interaction is through the `propertiesMap` passed to the reader or writer. These properties, cataloged in the [documentation](https://github.com/JulianJaffePinterest/druid/blob/spark_druid_connector/docs/development/spark.md#configuration-reference) mostly follow the corresponding Druid properties. If desired, there are typed helpers for setting these options in `org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameReader` and `org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameWriter` as well. Sample usages of these helpers are\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameReader\r\n\r\nsparkSession\r\n  .read\r\n  .brokerHost(\"localhost\")\r\n  .brokerPort(8082)\r\n  .metadataDbType(\"mysql\")\r\n  .metadataUri(\"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\")\r\n  .metadataUser(\"druid\")\r\n  .metadataPassword(\"diurd\")\r\n  .dataSource(\"dataSource\")\r\n  .druid()\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameWriter\r\nimport org.apache.druid.spark.model.LocalDeepStorageConfig\r\n\r\nval deepStorageConfig = new LocalDeepStorageConfig().storageDirectory(\"/mnt/druid/druid-segments/\")\r\n\r\ndf\r\n  .write\r\n  .metadataDbType(\"mysql\")\r\n  .metadataUri(\"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\")\r\n  .metadataUser(\"druid\")\r\n  .metadataPassword(\"diurd\")\r\n  .version(1)\r\n  .deepStorage(deepStorageConfig)\r\n  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)\r\n  .dataSource(\"dataSource\")\r\n  .druid()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few key areas to be aware of:\r\n\r\nFirst, due to Spark's design, DataSourceWriters can not repartition the dataframe they are responsible for writing and they have very little information about the overall partitioning. To compensate for this, the writer includes a number of partitioners out of the box. These partitioners by necessity have no context for the data they are partitioning and so will be slower than usage-specific partitioners but are suitable for prototyping. If the provided partitioners are not used, there are a few behaviors to be aware of. For \"simple\" ShardSpecs (`LinearShardSpec` and `NumberedShardSpec`) the writer will default to rationalizing the output segments into contiguous and complete blocks, ensuring that loading and overshadowing of the output will be handled atomically by Druid. For more complex shard spec types such as `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` and `SingleDimensionShardSpec`, users will need to provided a partition map to the writer, linking Spark partition ids to information required to construct the corresponding Druid segments. The included Spark partitioners all provide partition maps and can be used as references for how to implement similar behavior in custom partitioners.\r\n\r\nSecond, because this code executes in a Spark cluster rather than a Druid cluster, it cannot take advantage of Druid's extension support directly. Instead, these connectors utilize a plugin registry system that parallels Druid's extensions. The complex metric types, metadata stores, and deep storage types supported by core Druid extensions are also supported out of the box with this extension, with the exception of Azure deep storage. If users wish to implement their own plugins to handle specific complex metrics types, metadata servers, shard specs, or deep storage implementations, they can register plugins to handle their use cases with the respective plugin registries before loading or saving data and the Spark connectors will use the provided logic for the corresponding tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nTesting is handled via a combination of unit tests and light integration tests. Testing is focused on the core Spark code that handles reading and writing data, although most functionality is covered by at least one unit test. The key classes are `DruidDataSourceReader`, `DruidInputPartitionReader`, and `DruidInputPartition` on the read side and `DruidDataSourceWriter`, `DruidDataWriterFactory`, and `DruidDataWriter` on the write side. The tests are in the corresponding `*Suite` classes. Additionally, there is a lightweight round-trip test in `DruidDataSourceV2` suite which writes out test data to local segments, updates metadata in an embedded Derby instance, reads the segments back into a Dataframe, and confirms that the rows read in matches the rows written out. This test also confirms that the metadata entries created by the writer is correct.\r\n\r\nThe main gap in testing is the cross-compatibility matrix. I'm not sure how to repeatably test these connectors' interaction with deep storage types other than local and with metadata servers other than derby. This code has been run at scale against Druid deployments using HDFS for deep storage and Postgresql for metadata and I am aware of production users with S3 and GCP deep storage, but the Azure support is lightly modified from how the corresponding Druid extension handles configuration and otherwise untested beyond parsing.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

query granularity to compaction task\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd query granularity to compaction task. Note that query granularity is still not supported in auto compaction.\r\nThis PR also creates a new class `CompactionGranularitySpec` to use instead of `GranularitySpec` when passing query granularity and segment granularity into compaction task. This allows the null value (value not given by the user) to represent using the original current query granularity and segment granularity (this is the existing behavior for compaction task). Note that the Compaction task ultimately still converts `CompactionGranularitySpec` to a `UniformGranularitySpec` when creating the index ingestion spec\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR makes the `druid-basic-security` extension a bit more relaxed across versions by ignoring any permissions which have unknown `ResourceType` or `Action` values (they use enums).\r\n\r\nA subtle backwards incompatibility was introduced in #10812, if permissions using `Resource` of type `ResourceType.VIEW` are added (or created automatically when creating default admin user in a new install), rolling back to a previous version of Druid results in explosions because the enum in the older version does not contain this value. (The same backwards incompatibility would occur with the changes in #10571). \r\n\r\nRather than rework these types to deserialize into strings and then filtering out permissions with unknown resource types or action values from the list (or, i guess null checking everywhere), this PR instead introduces a custom deserializer for the list of permissions stored in a `BasicAuthorizerRole`, chomping json processing exceptions so it can ignore any permissions which fail to deserialize. I'm open to other approaches to this too if anyone has opinions here.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

PR fixes two performance issues in the timeline conversion, observed when an interval has a large number of segments. For such an interval, \r\n- Reading the timeline entries from the original timeline. `PartitionHolder.asImmutable` is an expensive operation since it involves a deep copy of the chunk. And on top of that, a deep copy is done for every segment in the interval which significantly amplifies the performance overhead O(N*N)\r\n- Adding the entries to the new timeline. This involves an `isComplete` call which too is O(N) for a single interval. Thus, writing to a new timeline is O(N*N) as well.

maxBytesInMemory for heap overhead of sinks and hydrants check\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere is currently two bugs with maxBytesInMemory for heap overhead of sinks and hydrants check.\r\nThe first bug is that the check for maxBytesInMemory for heap overhead of sinks and hydrants check is currently done instead the `persistAll` method. The `persistAll` method is done in the background and while the `persistAll` method is running, there could already be another concurrent in-memory ingestion. The new in-memory ingestion would use the old value of `bytesCurrentlyInMemory` without accounting for the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants from the latest persist (since we only calculate the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants in the `persistAll` method.\r\nThe second bug is that the memory overhead of sinks and hydrants check lags by one persist iteration. In each persist iteration the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants is calculated and store in a variable called bytesCurrentlyInMemory. However, bytesCurrentlyInMemory is only check against the limit in the next iteration of persist. This is because, in the current iteration we check against `bytesInMemoryBeforePersist` which is a copy of `bytesCurrentlyInMemory` at the start of the persist (not accounting for the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants in the current persist). Basically we will only fails the task one persist iteration after we have already reached the limit. Most of the time this is fine as our limit is below the real JVM memory capacity. However, for JVM memory that is set very low, this bug can results in OOM.  \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problem by moving the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants check outside of the `persistAll` method. It is now done before the background task `persistAll` method. This also eliminates the needs of `bytesInMemoryBeforePersist` variable. Hence, we can adds the heap overhead of sinks and hydrants to `bytesCurrentlyInMemory` and checks `bytesCurrentlyInMemory` before calling `persistAll` \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make the dependency-check job less flaky. It addresses intermittent failures with error messages like\r\n\r\n`Failed to request component-reports`\r\n\r\nThis was inspired by the workaround suggested in https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/1908\r\nLocal testing appears to support the workaround mentioned in this issue.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of this approach is that the job will no longer produce a dependency vulnerability report - so if the job fails, devs need to run `mvn dependency-check:check` locally to see which project the vulnerability is reported from.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the version to the latest. The upgrade from 5.x to 6.x is a breaking change for some use cases, but AFAICT nothing was needed as part of the version upgrade.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar

Description\r\nThis PR adds a new config, `druid.sql.avatica.minRowsPerFrame` as a counterpart to `druid.sql.avatica.maxRowsPerFrame`, to give cluster operators some control over the size of frames (and so indirect control over the overall number of fetch requests required), as large result sets can require many thousands of frames to transfer at the default size of 100.\r\n\r\nRelated, this config also serves as a sort of workaround to a missing feature (or bug?) of Avatica, described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2322, where the `fetchSize` parameter of a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` are ignored and hard coded to use a default value of 100. There is an associated PR that is a couple of years old, https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica/pull/49; with some minor fix-up to make things build I was able to locally patch my Druid and confirm it fixes the issue and allows us to pick up the user set `fetchSize` set on JDBC queries on our end. That PR seems to have lost momentum though, so I'm going to try to see if I can pick it up and get that issue fixed.\r\n\r\nThis configuration is still useful even if the Avatica issue is resolved, because that fix allows JDBC users to give hints to the size of result sets that they would like, but this PR gives operators control to prevent very small fetch sizes with large result sets from choking things with a large number of fetch requests, or generally optimally tune default jdbc result sizes for typical workloads and override user requests.\r\n\r\nFrame size does have implications for JDBC performance as well. Using a simple utility, I did some tests with 500k total results using various fetch sizes (with the patched Avatica, but the same holds if done via the new server config).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=100 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 2971 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=1000 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 1479 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=10000 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 1166 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=100000 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 2221 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=500000 > out.txt\r\nResults processed: 2184 millis\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere does appear to be a sort of goldilocks zone of not too small not too big, but that might vary per query and/or overall result set size, I haven't really played with it much.\r\n\r\nGoing through a router seems to exaggerate the overhead of small frame sizes as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8888/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=100 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 7394 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=100 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 2219 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8888/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=10000 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 1518 millis\r\n$ ./druid-jdbc prepared-statement --jdbc=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://localhost:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/ --path=./test.sql --fetch=10000 > out.csv\r\nResults processed: 1176 millis\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #10876 .\r\n\r\n### Release Notes Rough Draft\r\n\r\nAllow a Druid cluster to kill segments whose interval_end is a date in the future. This can be done by setting `druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain` to a negative period. For example `PT-24H` would allow segments to be killed if their interval_end date  was 24 hours or less into the future at the time that the kill task is generated by the system.\r\n\r\nA cluster operator can also disregard the `druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain` entirely by setting a new configuration, `druid.coordinator.kill.ignoreDurationToRetain=true`. This ignores interval_end date when looking for segments to kill, and instead is capable of killing any segment marked unused. This new configuration is off by default, and a cluster operator should fully understand and accept the risks if they enable it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n~I have marked this as requiring \"Design Review\" because the default config change has meaningful impact on end users who choose to use the kill feature of the coordinator. Current users will already have created their own overrides that will continue to function as expected. However, operators turning on this feature could experience surprise by the default so I want to make sure multiple committers approve of the approach.~\r\n\r\n~I won't remove the \"design review\" label, but I did make a change to bring the default behavior back in line with what is available in our releases today. The default value for `druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain` is now invalid again, it has just changed. Since `PT-1S` is valid with my change, I made it so the default is `null`. This causes a similar precondition failure that is currently there today. Operators who already have an override of this config will see zero change in behavior.~\r\n\r\nThis PR allows cluster operators to configure their Coordinator to kill segments whose \"end\" date is in the future as compared to the time when the coordinator is executing kill logic.\r\n\r\nThe first change allows an operator to specify a negative duration. A negative duration subtracted from now will be a future date. This is what allows an operator to choose some duration into the future where they will let segments be killed. ~A side effect of this is the invalid default of the past is no longer a good default.~ ~The idea of using a negative duration to force the operator to consciously choose a valid possible duration is no longer an option so I switched the default to `null`. This mimics the same behavior as the previous default.~ ~I changed the default to `PT0s` and future users of the kill docs will have to read the documentation to know this value must be changed accordingly if they don't like the default.~\r\n\r\nI also added a new configuration to the coordinator, `druid.coordinator.kill.ignoreDurationToRetain`. This configuration allows an operator to just tell druid that it does not need to care for the End time of candidates for killing. Any segment that is marked unused is a valid candidate that can be killed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #10859.\r\n\r\nThere is also an alternate implementation as follows where we add following method to `GuiceAnnotationIntrospector` and remove `#findPropertyIgnorals`\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public boolean hasIgnoreMarker(AnnotatedMember annotated)\r\n  {\r\n    return annotated.hasAnnotation(JacksonInject.class);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThough, it will throw an exception if the user tries to pass input with values for properties that were annotated with JacksonInject.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

The details are as follows:\r\n1. If a segment is smaller than `inputSegmentSizeBytes`, the segment size will be compact.In fact, we are more concerned with compact with multiple small files.\r\n2. The coordinator timer resubmits compact from the latest interval every time. There may be a situation that the old interval cannot do compact all the time due to insufficient slots.\r\n3. The Coordinator's timer submits in order from the latest interval to the oldest. Intervals submitted by the Coordinator may be blocked by a lock, and the Compact task that only applies the latest interval is more likely to block or fail and occupy a slot, we need to set `skipOffsetFromLatest` big enough, and it will waste recent many small files without compaction.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Current behavior\r\n\r\nWhen two or more segments are compacted the new compacted segment’s query granularity is null regardless of the query granularities of the segments that were compacted.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen two or more segments are compacted the new compacted segment’s query granularity should reflect the query granularities of the  segments that were compacted. If all the  segments that were compacted had the same query granularity then the compacted segment will have the same query granularity when at least one segment’s granularity is non-null. If the compacted segments had different query granularities then the compacted segment will have the finer of all the granularities. The existing method of class Granularities: List<Granularity> granularitiesFinerThan(final Granularity gran0) skips NONE and ALL granularities so we will write a new Comparator that includes NONE and ALL.  In particular, If at least one segments has NONE  then the resulting granularity for the newly created, compacted segment, will also be NONE thus avoiding destructing data.\r\n\r\n### Reasoning of why we decided the expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the compacted segments have the same query granularity the expected behavior makes sense without controversy. However when the query granularities of the segments that were compacted are different there are various choices. One choice is to pick the coarsest granularity. We decided against this because this is a destructive operation on some records of the segments that were compacted. Another choice is to use a configuration dependent flag. We decided against this so we give ourselves more time to learn about the data lifecycle management use cases. We will revisit this decision at a later point.\r\n\r\n### Impact on existing documentation\r\n\r\nThe new behavior needs to be documented. In particular if the segments that were compacted had different granularities it needs to be explained that the “finest” non-null granularity was chosen. It also needs to be documented that this choice may cause some records that previously had a coarsest query granularity to appear to have “spikes” (since now the whole segment has a finer granularity).","created_at":"2021-02-05T02:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T07:56:05Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T09:35:10Z","merged_at":"2021-02-18T09:35:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"eabad0fb352ee7f1f32658edb95d236fe1837662","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

segmentGranularity for auto-compaction\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe auto-compaction configuration should support a segmentGranularity option like manual compaction task.\r\n- Storing granularitySpec in CompactionState. This is so that auto compaction can determine if compaction needs to be done or not (when segmentGranularity in auto compaction config changes)\r\n- Adds granularitySpec inDataSourceCompactionConfig. This allows segmentGranularity to be set in auto compaction config. Currently, only segmentGranularity of granularitySpec is supported by auto compaction and setting other values (i.e. queryGranularity) will fail.\r\n- In CompactSegments, pass  granularitySpec to indexingServiceClient.compactSegments. This is to pass the segmentGranularity value inside granularitySpec into the ingestionSpec of the compact task. Note that we also add granularitySpec field in CompactionTask and deprecates segmentGranularity field in CompactionTask. This is so that in the future we can support queryGranularity and rollup in compaction task. As a result, in CompactionTask we uses the segmentGranularity inside granularitySpec instead of the deprecated top level segmentGranularity field.\r\n- needsCompaction in NewestSegmentFirstIterator needs to take into account changing granularitySpec. We will have to compact segments when segmentGranularity changes.\r\n- When segmentGranularity changes, we also cancel any active compaction task that have different segmentGranularity and re-compact those intervals with the new segmentGranularity. \r\n- NewestSegmentFirstIterator will also possibly return multiple segments of the same bucket for the new segmentGranularity (if segmentGranularity given). For example, if the original segment granularity is day then NewestSegmentFirstIterator currently will return a single day for each iteration. But if the new segmentGranularity in the auto compaction config is larger such as week, we cannot just compact a single day with segment granularity = week (Basically we cannot send a compact task with interval of a single day). Hence, the NewestSegmentFirstIterator will have to take into account the new segmentGranularity (week) and combine 7 days and return a period of seven days.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

However, the issue seems like a race as the maven build uses 2 threads to build modules. The `druid-ranger-security` module is the second last one that maven builds, and thus it might not be installed yet when maven builds the last module, `distribution`. This PR changes to the `install` command to build all other modules first before building the `distribution`.","created_at":"2021-02-03T06:19:26Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T07:52:02Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T23:01:48Z","merged_at":"2021-02-04T23:01:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c24b6f0234a2ed898d78e79e5e4291b684d9af9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nIn the current Druid security model, the people who can ingest data are usually system administrators or trusted users because they will get the same privilege as what the Overlord has. However, when ingest permission is granted to a non-trusted user for some reason, it could be problematic if that user can ingest from any domains using HTTP inputSource. This PR changes HTTP inputSource to deny access to all domains by default. This can be a good practice for system admins to think about what domains they want to allow before using HTTP inputSource.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR primarily does two things:\r\n* refactors the (afaict) currently unused Druid view system in the hopes that someday it can be built into something useful, by splitting into a separate calcite schema and introducing a new `ResourceType.VIEW` authorization construct to allow defining access to views separately from datasources.\r\n* refactors `SqlLifecycle` to authorize datasources (and now views) up front, before preparing or planning a query, by analyzing the SQL expression directly rather than waiting until after the transformation from SQL to native Druid query is done.\r\n\r\n_Note that this PR does not introduce or propose a view management system at this time, that exercise is left for future work, what is going on here is just refactoring some internal stuff that might someday be used for something cool._\r\n\r\n### Views\r\nInstead of living in `DruidSchema`, a new `ViewSchema` has been introduced to hold all Druid views. This is technically an incompatible change, since `druid.some_view` is now `view.some_view`, but since this isn't currently a real feature I think this should not be problematic.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, authorization was performed against the final set of datasources which would be touched by the native Druid query, and done after planning has been completed (and done twice, once in `SqlLifecycle` and also again in `QueryLifecycle`). However, this is not appropriate for views, as it has an overly strict requirement that to query a view, you must also be authorized to read from all underlying datasources, which of course precludes scenarios like   providing a restricted view onto a larger underlying table as a means to control access.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, a new `ResourceType.VIEW` construct has been introduced, and SQL query authorization is now done against the set of `Resource` of `ResourceType.DATASOURCE` and `ResourceType.VIEW` which are utilized in the query. In this model views are more or less authorized the same as tables, just separately. \r\n\r\nSplitting the 'view' and 'druid' schema also makes any theoretical view manager implementation easier to implement because it would not have to worry about name collisions with Druid datasources, just other views, and requires no other changes to Druid like a real solution cohabitating the same schema would require.\r\n\r\n### SqlLifecycle and DruidPlanner\r\nSince authorization required a refactor to support independent view authorization anyway, I took the opportunity to rework a bit how `SqlLifecycle` functions, changing the order of the state transitions to move authorization earlier in the process, which is now modeled by this new flow:\r\n```\r\nnew -> initialized -> authorizing -> authorized -> (unauthorized | planned -> executing -> done)\r\n```\r\nTo collect the set of `Resource` to authenticate, the `DruidPlanner` which `SqlLifecycle` wraps, has a new method `validate` which returns a `ValidationResult` containing the set of all views and datasources that were identified in the query. Mechanically this list is constructed using a `SqlShuttle` which walks the SQL expression tree to examine `SqlIdentifier` which the validator associates with a table identifier to lookup whether its a 'druid' or a 'view', and construct the correct `Resource` accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe added `DruidPlannerResourceAnalyzeTest` has some tests which are trying to trip up the `SqlResourceCollectorShuttle`, it looks good so far in my testing but I'm sure there are scenarios I'm not thinking of though. If anyone is worried about this new approach to resolving the resources to authorize, I can introduce a config option to retain the previous check against the old set of datasource names after planning (though I would rather not do this if possible).\r\n\r\nAuthorizing before planning should also help reduce some potential waste spent planning queries, which can be non-trivial depending on complexity, and then would later not be able to execute due to authorization failure.\r\n\r\nI think there are some further improvements that can be made with `SqlLifecycle` and `DruidPlanner`, but have not done these changes in this PR to keep it from growing too large. For example, there is a lot of repeated parsing/validation work done between the phases of the lifecycle, which could probably be re-used.\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried to fill out some of the javadoc in this area, since it was kind of lacking, hopefully it's better.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
