like in Spark 2.0 the optimization of repeat aggregates being represented by a single aggregate was broken because of passing of resultId: ExprID in the constructor of AggregateExpression. Thus if the query is of type\r\nselect avg(x), y from tab  group by y having avg(x) > 0\r\nideally there should be only 1 aggregate evaluated . But since the resultID passed is different in the analyze phase, the distinct on aggregateExpressions, does not result in 1 aggregate .\r\nThe change is to implement the equality/hashCode method of aggregate expression instead of relying on scala case class generated methods. and ensuring the dependency on the aggregate which gets removed, is correctly rewritten.

REST API has a security filter that performs auth checks\r\nbased on the UI root's security manager. That works fine when\r\nthe UI root is the app's UI, but not when it's the history server.\r\n\r\nIn the SHS case, all users would be allowed to see all applications\r\nthrough the REST API, even if the UI itself wouldn't be available\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThis change adds auth checks for each app access through the API\r\ntoo, so that only authorized users can see the app's data.\r\n\r\nThe change also modifies the existing security filter to use\r\n`HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser()`, which is used in other\r\nplaces. That is not necessarily the same as the principal's\r\nname; for example, when using Hadoop's SPNEGO auth filter,\r\nthe remote user strips the realm information, which then matches\r\nthe user name registered as the owner of the application.\r\n\r\nI also renamed the UIRootFromServletContext trait to a more generic\r\nname since I'm using it to store more context information now.\r\n\r\nTested manually with an authentication filter enabled.","created_at":"2017-02-22T00:18:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T21:20:03Z","closed_at":"2017-02-22T21:19:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28218378bcc9614f52e6b2ca6ab0e71a8e20cf9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4b5d3eae7cef0b4956f756f2474381480fa0a12","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-19652_2.1","ref":"SPARK-19652_2.1","sha":"f4b5d3eae7cef0b4956f756f2474381480fa0a12","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `[[` method is supposed to take a single index and return a column. This is different from base R which takes a vector index.  We should check for this and issue warning or error when vector index is supplied (which is very likely given the behavior in base R). \r\n\r\nCurrently I'm issuing a warning message and just take the first element of the vector index.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`MetastoreRelation` is used to represent table relation for hive tables, and provides some hive related information. We will resolve `SimpleCatalogRelation` to `MetastoreRelation` for hive tables, which is unnecessary as these 2 are the same essentially. This PR merges `SimpleCatalogRelation` and `MetastoreRelation` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHDFSBackedStateStoreProvider fails to rename files on HDFS but not on the local filesystem. According to the [implementation notes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/filesystem.html) of `rename()`, the behavior of the local filesystem and HDFS varies:\r\n\r\n> Destination exists and is a file\r\n> Renaming a file atop an existing file is specified as failing, raising an exception.\r\n>    - Local FileSystem : the rename succeeds; the destination file is replaced by the source file.\r\n>    - HDFS : The rename fails, no exception is raised. Instead the method call simply returns false.\r\n\r\nThis patch ensures that `rename()` isn't called if the destination file already exists.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges `DataSourceStrategy#translateFilter` to operate on a `NamedExpressions` rather than just and `Attribute`, as it switches off of the `name` property, defined in `NamedExpressions`. `GetStructField` now implements `NamedExpression`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTesting thus far is manual, using debugger, explain plan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent RFormula drops the least frequent level for a string feature column because StringIndexer sorts string values in descending order of frequency. Two issues with this:\r\n- In practical applications, there is often need to set the most frequent value as the reference level for better interpretability.  \r\n- Other software such as R sets the first  alphabetical value as the reference level. It's desirable to have such an option in order to compare results.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds more options to order string values in StringIndexer and RFormula. We add a parameter `stringOrderType` to control how string is ordered which supports four options:  \r\n - \"freq_desc\": sort in descending order by frequency of values. In StringIndexer, the most frequent value is indexed 0, and in RFormula the least frequent value is the reference level. This is the default and consistent with current behavior. \r\n- \"freq_asc\": sort in ascending order by frequency of values. In StringIndexer, the least frequent value is indexed 0, and in RFormula the most frequent value is the reference level. \r\n- \"alphabet_desc\": sort in alphabetically descending order. This sets the first alphabetical value as reference level in RFormula, which is R's default behavior. \r\n- \"alphabet_asc\": sort in alphabetically ascending order.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests added for StringIndexer and RFormula.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we create a managed table with HiveEnabled in default database,  Spark will use the location of default database as the table's location, this is ok in non-shared metastore.\r\n\r\nWhile if we use a shared metastore between different clusters， for example，\r\n1) there is a hive metastore in Cluster-A, and the metastore use a remote mysql as its db, and create a default database in metastore, then the location of the default database is the path in Cluster-A\r\n\r\n2) then we create another Cluster-B, and Cluster-B also use the same remote mysql as its metastore's db, so the default database conf in Cluster-B download from mysql, which location is the path of Cluster-A\r\n\r\n3) then we create a table in Cluster-B in default database, it will throw an exception, that UnknowHost Cluster-A\r\n\r\nIn Hive2.0.0, it is allowed to create a table in default database which shared between clusters , and this action is not allowed in other database, just for default.\r\n\r\nAs a spark User, we will want to have the same action as Hive, thus we can create table in default database using a shared mysql in metastore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test added","created_at":"2017-02-20T14:52:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:06Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b584a8e557ba0b8f3ff542524e60848e8ad4bad2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f93f5d3f9b80c0c8792d14b4fecddbc576234bd6","head":{"label":"windpiger:defaultDBPathInHive","ref":"defaultDBPathInHive","sha":"f93f5d3f9b80c0c8792d14b4fecddbc576234bd6","user":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70575274,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDU3NTI3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"windpiger/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger/spark","description":"Mirror

many machine learning cases, driver has to aggregate high-dimensional vectors/arrays from executors.\r\nTreeAggregate is good solution for aggregating vectors to driver, and you can increase depth of tree when data is large.\r\nHowever, treeAggregate would still failed, when the parition number of RDD and the dimension of vector grows up.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new operator of RDD, named sliceAggregate, which split the vector into **_n_** slices and each slice is assigned a key(from 0 to **_n-1_**). The RDD[key, slice] will be transform to RDD[slice] by using reduceByKey operator.\r\nFinally driver will collect and compose the **_n_** slices to obtain result.\r\n\r\n![qq 20170220214746](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4936059/23129541/0f462474-f7be-11e6-997e-e494b98eee69.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI run an experiment which calculate the statistic values of features.\r\nThe number of samples is 1000. The feature dimension ranges from 10k to 20m, the comparition of time cost between treeAggregate and sliceAggregate is shown as follows. When feature dimension reach 20 million, treeAggregate was failed.\r\n\r\nThe table of time cost(ms) between sliceAggregate and treeAggregate.\r\n\r\n| feature dimension |\tsliceAggregate

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf there are aliased expression in the projection, we propagate constraints by completely expanding the original constraints with aliases.\r\n\r\nThis expanding costs much computation time when the number of aliases increases.\r\n\r\nFully expanding all constraints at all the time makes iterative ML algorithms where a ML pipeline with many stages runs very slow. See #16785.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is we actually don't need the additional constraints at most of time. For example, if there is a constraint \"a > b\", and \"a\" is aliased to \"c\" and \"d\". When we use this constraint in filtering, we don't need all constraints \"a > b\", \"c > b\", \"d > b\". We only need \"a > b\" because if it is false, it is guaranteed that all other constraints are false too.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\n\r\nRun the following codes locally.\r\n\r\n    import

use the value of  `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` to overwrite `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` , it set it to `sparkContext.conf` which does not overwrite the value is hadoopConf, I think it should put in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe root cause of the problem is that when spark is inferring schema from the csv file, it tries to resolve the file path pattern more then once by calling DataSouce.resolveRelation each time.\r\n\r\nSo, if we have file path like:\r\n<...>/test*\r\nand the actual file with name: test{00-1}.txt\r\nThen from the initial call of DataSouce.resolveRelation the pattern will be resolved to /<...>/test{00-1}.txt. When it tries to infer schema for csv file, it calls DataSouce.resolveRelation the second time. The second attempt to resolve the path pattern fails because the file name /<...>/test{00-1}.txt is considered as a pattern and not as actual file and if there no file that match that pattern the  whole DataSouce.resolveRelation fails.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the fix is quite straightforward:\r\nThe part of DataSouce.resolveRelation that creates Hadoop Relation based on a resolved(actual) file names moved to separate function createHadoopRelation. CSVFileFormat.createBaseDataset calls this new function instead of DataSouce.resolveRelation, that caused unnecessary file path resolution.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tests\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source license.\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-20T02:26:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc5536dbeba8eec81dc68ad61f9d6f1450e4019f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16995/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16995/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16995/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/480207d5a8d6aff95bce82272533c82d79308742","head":{"label":"lxsmnv:SPARK-19340","ref":"SPARK-19340","sha":"480207d5a8d6aff95bce82272533c82d79308742","user":{"login":"lxsmnv","id":25268238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjY4MjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25268238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv","html_url":"https://github.com/lxsmnv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82478810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjQ3ODgxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"lxsmnv/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lxsmnv","id":25268238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjY4MjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25268238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv","html_url":"https://github.com/lxsmnv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lxsmnv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lxsmnv/spark","description":"Mirror

current Spark Streaming version cannot support the change of batch interval at runtime, given that the speed of input data streams may not highly dynamic from current Internet applications. If we have to do so, one must stop the program first, modify the corresponding code, and then restart the program. However, this will interrupt the execution of entire program, and may cause the data loss. Towards this end, our contribution is to implement a Dynamic Batch Interval Adjustment functionality that can help change the batch interval size at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis functionality contains two algorithms. One is dynamic adjustment, and the other is static adjustment. The former can predict the size of input data stream and as a result the processing time, by using the most recent processing time and used batch interval. In this way, one can decide whether the batch interval needs to be changed or not, to avoid the data backlog, and secure the system stability. On the other hand, the static adjustment needs the user to manually change the configuration file.\r\n\r\nJIRA Issue: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19663](url)\r\nMy report:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFair Scheduler can be built via one of the following options:\r\n- By setting a `spark.scheduler.allocation.file` property, \r\n- By setting `fairscheduler.xml` into classpath.\r\n\r\nThese options are checked **in order** and fair-scheduler is built via first found option. If invalid path is found, `FileNotFoundException` will be expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims unit test coverage of these use cases and a minor documentation change has been added for second option(`fairscheduler.xml` into classpath) to inform the users.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR was related with #16813 and has been created separately to keep patch content as isolated and to help the reviewers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new Unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\ncurrently if multiple streaming queries listeners exists, when a QueryTerminatedEvent is triggered, only one of the listeners will be invoked while the rest of the listeners will ignore the event.\r\nthis is caused since the the streaming queries listeners bus holds a set of running queries ids and when a termination event is triggered, after the first listeners is handling the event, the terminated query id is being removed from the set. \r\nin this PR, the query id will be removed from the set only after all the listeners handles the event\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na test with multiple listeners has been added to StreamingQueryListenerSuite\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-19T11:35:33Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T23:59:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-26T23:59:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8002b6e606fc3e92edd3433b9ba121a10f50828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/896f5b33d01fa51db9d8ee53a8cc95274654f9e8","head":{"label":"eyalzit:master","ref":"master","sha":"896f5b33d01fa51db9d8ee53a8cc95274654f9e8","user":{"login":"eyalzit","id":6285690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODU2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6285690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalzit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82441212,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjQ0MTIxMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"eyalzit/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eyalzit","id":6285690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODU2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6285690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit","html_url":"https://github.com/eyalzit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyalzit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eyalzit/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the whole block is fetched into memory(off heap by default) when shuffle-read. A block is defined by (shuffleId, mapId, reduceId). Thus it can be large when skew situations. If OOM happens during shuffle read, job will be killed and users will be notified to \"Consider boosting spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead\". Adjusting parameter and allocating more memory can resolve the OOM. However the approach is not perfectly suitable for production environment, especially for data warehouse.\r\nUsing Spark SQL as data engine in warehouse, users hope to have a unified parameter(e.g. memory) but less resource wasted(resource is allocated but not used). The hope is strong especially when migrating data engine to Spark from another one(e.g. Hive). Tuning the parameter for thousands of SQLs one by one is very time consuming.\r\nIt's not always easy to predict skew situations, when happen, it make sense to fetch remote blocks to disk for shuffle-read, rather than kill the job because of OOM. \r\n\r\nIn this pr, I propose to fetch big blocks to disk(which is also mentioned in SPARK-3019):\r\n\r\n1. Track average size and also the outliers(which are larger than 2*avgSize) in MapStatus;\r\n2. Request memory from `MemoryManager` before fetch blocks and release the memory to `MemoryManager` when `ManagedBuffer` is released.\r\n3. Fetch remote blocks to disk when failing acquiring memory from `MemoryManager`, otherwise fetch to memory.\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement for memory control when shuffle blocks and help to avoid OOM in scenarios like below:\r\n1. Single huge block;\r\n2. Sizes of many blocks are underestimated in `MapStatus` and the actual footprint of blocks is much larger than the estimated.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test in `MapStatusSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if `NumPartitions` is not set in RepartitionByExpression, we will set it using `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` during Planner. However, this is not following the general resolution process. This PR is to set it in `Parser` and then `Optimizer` can use the value for plan optimization.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now file source always uses `InMemoryFileIndex` to scan files from a given path.\r\n\r\nBut when reading the outputs from another streaming query, the file source should use `MetadataFileIndex` to list files from the sink log. This patch adds this support.\r\n\r\n## `MetadataFileIndex` or `InMemoryFileIndex`\r\n```scala\r\nspark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(...)\r\n  .load(\"/some/path\") // for a non-glob path:\r\n                      //   - use `MetadataFileIndex` when `/some/path/_spark_meta` exists\r\n                      //   - fall back to `InMemoryFileIndex` otherwise\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nspark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(...)\r\n  .load(\"/some/path/*/*\") // for a glob path: always use `InMemoryFileIndex`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntwo newly added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd support for arbitrary Scala `Map` types in deserialization as well as a generic implicit encoder.\r\n\r\nUsed the builder approach as in #16541 to construct any provided `Map` type upon deserialization.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR also adds (ignored) tests for issue [SPARK-19104 CompileException with Map and Case Class in Spark 2.1.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19104) but doesn't solve it.\r\n\r\nAdded support for Java Maps in codegen code (encoders will be added in a different PR) with the following default implementations for interfaces/abstract classes:\r\n\r\n* `java.util.Map`, `java.util.AbstractMap` => `java.util.HashMap`\r\n* `java.util.SortedMap`, `java.util.NavigableMap` => `java.util.TreeMap`\r\n* `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` => `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`\r\n* `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap` => `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap`\r\n\r\nResulting codegen for `Seq(Map(1 -> 2)).toDS().map(identity).queryExecution.debug.codegen`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* 001 */ public Object generate(Object[]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the support for multiple lines for CSV by resembling the multiline supports in JSON datasource (in case of JSON, per file).\r\n\r\nSo, this PR introduces `wholeFile` option which makes the format not splittable and reads each whole file. Since Univocity parser can produces each row from a stream, it should be capable of parsing very large documents when the internal rows are fix in the memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `CSVSuite` and `tests.py`\r\n\r\nManual tests with a single 9GB CSV file in local file system, for example,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"wholeFile\", true).option(\"inferSchema\", true).csv(\"tmp.csv\").count()\r\n```","created_at":"2017-02-17T18:35:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:40Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T21:37:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0b0d164ae6a70a8206ac169d6c6918cd5175bd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22eb29eddfde484fbd887a32bf8be0b681c4d714","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19610","ref":"SPARK-19610","sha":"22eb29eddfde484fbd887a32bf8be0b681c4d714","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`TorrentBroadcast` uses a couple of \"back doors\" into the block manager to write and read data.\r\n\r\nThe thing these block manager methods have in common is that they bypass the encryption code; so broadcast data is stored unencrypted in the block manager, causing unencrypted data to be written to disk if those blocks need to be evicted from memory.\r\n\r\nThe correct fix here is actually not to change `TorrentBroadcast`, but to fix the block manager so that:\r\n\r\n- data stored in memory is not encrypted\r\n- data written to disk is encrypted\r\n\r\nThis would simplify the code paths that use BlockManager / SerializerManager APIs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nupdate and add unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn previous implementation of LSH approxNearestNeighbors, we have used sorting to get hashThreshold. By moving to approxQuantile, we can get as good results as the sort-based implementation while improving the running time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running unit tests BucketedRandomProjectionLSHSuite and MinHashLSHSuite\r\n\r\nAlso I tested on WEX dataset following [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BXg-67U83NVB3M0I84HVBVg3baAVaESD_mrg_-vLro/edit). Concretely, I use 2 executors to get 40 neighbors from a 2.8GB dataset with the numberHashTables set to 3. The results are as follows:\r\n\r\n|   | Time | Result |\r\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n|  Sort-based Multi-Probe | 16.85s | 40 rows |\r\n|  Quantile-based Multi-Probe (Error = 0.05) | 12.38s | same as sort-based (40 rows) |\r\n|  Quantile-based Multi-Probe (Error = 0.25) | 11.18s | same as single probe (14 rows) |\r\n|  Single-probe | 3.25s | 14 rows

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously it was possible for there to be a race between a task failure and committing the output of a task. For example, the driver may mark a task attempt as failed due to an executor heartbeat timeout (possibly due to GC), but the task attempt actually ends up coordinating with the OutputCommitCoordinator once the executor recovers and committing its result. This will lead to any retry attempt failing because the task result has already been committed despite the original attempt failing.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that any previously failed task attempts cannot enter the commit protocol.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently Analyzer as part of ResolveSubquery, pulls up the correlated predicates to its\r\noriginating SubqueryExpression. The subquery plan is then transformed to remove the correlated\r\npredicates after they are moved up to the outer plan. In this PR, the task of pulling up\r\ncorrelated predicates is deferred to Optimizer. This is the initial work that will allow us to\r\nsupport the form of correlated subqueries that we don't support today.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen adaptive execution is enabled, an exchange coordinator is used in the Exchange operators. For Join, the same exchange coordinator is used for its two Exchanges. But the physical plan shows two different coordinator Ids which is confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the incorrect exchange coordinator id in the physical plan. The coordinator object instead of the `Option[ExchangeCoordinator]` should be used to generate the identity hash code of the same coordinator. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nBefore the patch, the physical plan shows two different exchange coordinator id for Join. \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [key1#3L, value2#12L]\r\n+- *SortMergeJoin [key1#3L], [key2#11L], Inner\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe streaming thread in StreamExecution uses the following ways to check if it should exit:\r\n- Catch an InterruptException.\r\n- `StreamExecution.state` is TERMINATED.\r\n\r\nWhen starting and stopping a query quickly, the above two checks may both fail:\r\n- Hit [HADOOP-14084](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14084) and swallow InterruptException\r\n- StreamExecution.stop is called before `state` becomes `ACTIVE`. Then [runBatches](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dcc2d540a53f0bd04baead43fdee1c170ef2b9f3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L252) changes the state from `TERMINATED` to `ACTIVE`.\r\n\r\nIf the above cases both happen, the query will hang forever.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `state` to `AtomicReference` and uses`compareAndSet` to make sure we only change the state from `INITIALIZING` to `ACTIVE`. It also removes the `runUninterruptibly` hack from ``HDFSMetadata`, because HADOOP-14084 won't cause any problem after we fix the race condition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

an application to use the History Server URL as the tracking\r\nURL in the YARN RM, so there's still a link to the web UI somewhere\r\nin YARN even if the driver's UI is disabled.

Summary of changes\r\n\r\nAdd a new configuration option that allows Spark SQL to infer a case-sensitive schema from a Hive Metastore table's data files when a case-sensitive schema can't be read from the table properties.\r\n\r\n- Add spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode param to SQLConf\r\n- Add schemaPreservesCase field to CatalogTable (set to false when schema can't\r\n  successfully be read from Hive table props)\r\n- Perform schema inference in HiveMetastoreCatalog if schemaPreservesCase is\r\n  false, depending on spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode\r\n- Add alterTableSchema() method to the ExternalCatalog interface\r\n- Add HiveSchemaInferenceSuite tests\r\n- Refactor and move ParquetFileForamt.meregeMetastoreParquetSchema() as\r\n  HiveMetastoreCatalog.mergeWithMetastoreSchema\r\n- Move schema merging tests from ParquetSchemaSuite to HiveSchemaInferenceSuite\r\n\r\n[JIRA for this change](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe tests in ```HiveSchemaInferenceSuite``` should verify that schema inference is working as expected. ```ExternalCatalogSuite``` has also been extended to cover the new ```alterTableSchema()```

accidentally broke this PR with a force push. Opened #16944 to replace it.*\r\n\r\nReplaces #16797. See the discussion in this PR for more details/justification for this change.\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n[JIRA for this change](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611)\r\n\r\n- Add spark.sql.hive.schemaInferenceMode param to SQLConf\r\n- Add schemaFromTableProps field to CatalogTable (set to true when schema is\r\n  successfully read from table props)\r\n- Perform schema inference in HiveMetastoreCatalog if schemaFromTableProps is\r\n  false, depending on spark.sql.hive.schemaInferenceMode.\r\n- Update table metadata properties in HiveExternalCatalog.alterTable()\r\n- Add HiveSchemaInferenceSuite tests\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe tests in HiveSchemaInferenceSuite should verify that schema inference is working as expected.\r\n\r\n## Open issues\r\n\r\n- The option values for ```spark.sql.hive.schemaInferenceMode ``` (e.g. \"INFER_AND_SAVE\", \"INFER_ONLY\", \"NEVER_INFER\") should be made into constants or an enum. I couldn't find a sensible object to place them in though that doesn't introduce a dependency between sql/core and sql/hive.\r\n- Should \"INFER_AND_SAVE\" be the default behavior? This restores the out-of-the-box compatibility that was present prior to 2.1.0 but changes the behavior of 2.1.0 (which is essentially \"NEVER_INFER\").\r\n- Is ```HiveExternalCatalog.alterTable()``` the appropriate place to write back the table metadata properties outside of createTable()? Should a new external catalog method like updateTableMetadata() be introduced?\r\n- All partition columns will still be treated as case-insensitive even after inferring. As far as I remember, this has always been the case with schema inference prior to Spark 2.1.0 and I haven't made any attempts to reconcile this since it doesn't cause the same problems that case sensitive data fields do. Should we attempt to restore case sensitivity by inspecting file paths or leave this as-is?","created_at":"2017-02-15T19:40:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T22:51:01Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T21:50:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fcfd40f8e43b03af1762314721edcb87d4b2141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16942/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16942/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16942/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ced9c4d8363fb4e10e027da5a793ceabed11cfb7","head":{"label":"budde:SPARK-19611","ref":"SPARK-19611","sha":"ced9c4d8363fb4e10e027da5a793ceabed11cfb7","user":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":25752964,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc1Mjk2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"budde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"budde","id":798699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde","html_url":"https://github.com/budde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/budde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/budde/spark","description":"Mirror

table.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the SaveMode check is put in  `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` , and the SaveMode check actually use `path`, this is fine when we use `DataFrameWriter.save()`, because this situation of SaveMode act on `path`.\r\n\r\nWhile when we use  `CreateDataSourceAsSelectCommand`, the situation of SaveMode act on table, and \r\nwe have already do SaveMode check in `CreateDataSourceAsSelectCommand` for table , so we should not do SaveMode check in the following logic in `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` for path, this is redundant and wrong logic for `CreateDataSourceAsSelectCommand`\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the following DDL will succeed, when the location has been created we will append it or overwrite it.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE ...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nObserved by @felixcheung  in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16739, when users use the shuffle-enabled `repartition` API, they expect the partition they got should be the exact number they provided, even if they call shuffle-disabled `coalesce` later. \r\n\r\nCurrently, `CollapseRepartition` rule does not consider whether shuffle is enabled or not. Thus, we got the following unexpected result.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n    val df = spark.range(0, 10000, 1, 5)\r\n    val df2 = df.repartition(10)\r\n    assert(df2.coalesce(13).rdd.getNumPartitions == 5)\r\n    assert(df2.coalesce(7).rdd.getNumPartitions == 5)\r\n    assert(df2.coalesce(3).rdd.getNumPartitions == 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue. We preserve shuffle-enabled Repartition. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test
