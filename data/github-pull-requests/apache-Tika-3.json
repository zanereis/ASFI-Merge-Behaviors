Your help is appreciated!\r\n\r\nBefore opening the pull request, please verify that\r\n* there is an open issue on the [Tika issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TIKA) which describes the problem or the improvement. We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\r\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\r\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\r\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\r\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\r\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\r\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch.

version 1.10 onwards, XZ for Java is under\nthe BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD). 1.9 and older are in the\npublic domain and obviously remain so; the change only affects\nthe new releases.</p>\n<p>0BSD is an extremely permissive license which doesn't require\nretaining or reproducing copyright or license notices when\ndistributing the code, thus in practice there is extremely\nlittle difference to public domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mark copyright and license information in the source package so\nthat it is compliant to the <a href=\"https://reuse.software/spec-3.2/\">REUSE Specification

be at the end of the stream\nafter successful decompression.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support .lzma files that have both a known uncompressed size and\nthe end marker. Such files are uncommon but valid. The same issue\nwas fixed in XZ Utils 5.2.6 in 2022.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add ARM64 and RISC-V BCJ filters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Speed optimizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta filter</li>\n<li>LZMA/LZMA2 decoder</li>\n<li>LZMA/LZMA2 encoder (partially Java &gt;= 9 only)</li>\n<li>CRC64 (Java &gt;= 9 only)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes that affect API/ABI compatibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change XZOutputStream constructors to not call the method\n<code>public void updateFilters(FilterOptions[] filterOptions)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In SeekableXZInputStream, change the method\n<code>public void seekToBlock(int blockNumber)</code> to not call\nthe method <code>public long getBlockPos(int blockNumber)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make the filter options classes <code>final</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARM64Options</li>\n<li>ARMOptions</li>\n<li>ARMThumbOptions</li>\n<li>DeltaOptions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[io.grpc:grpc-bom](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) from 1.60.0 to 1.65.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.65.0</h2>\n<p>grpc-netty in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.</p>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Add <code>ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)</code> (960012d76). This is the same as the existing <code>inboundHeaders()</code>, but is provided the Metadata</li>\n<li>api: Fix various typos in the documentation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11144\">#11144</a>) (6ec744f2a)</li>\n<li>core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code</li>\n<li>util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11139\">#11139</a>) (781b4c457) This change shows <code>@ExperimentalApi</code> being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release</li>\n<li>examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11131\">#11131</a>) (c31dbf48a)</li>\n<li>binder: Add a connection timeout (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11255\">#11255</a>) (791f894e2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible</li>\n<li>netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11294\">#11294</a>) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption</li>\n<li>okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19). Previously, shutting down when a new connection was being established could result in the server never becoming terminated</li>\n<li>inprocess: Fix listener race if transport is shutdown while starting (e4e7f3a06). This issue was unlikely to be hit outside of specialized tests</li>\n<li>services: restore //services:binarylog bazel target (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11292\">#11292</a>) (d57f271). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.62.2</li>\n<li>binder: Wait for all server transports to terminate before returning the security policy executor to the object pool (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11240\">#11240</a>) (34ee600dc)</li>\n<li>binder: Reject further SETUP_TRANSPORT requests post-BinderServer shutdown (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11260\">#11260</a>) (1670e97f7)</li>\n<li>bazel: Include missing com_google_protobuf_javalite in MODULE.bazel (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11147\">#11147</a>) (f995c121e)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thanks to</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hakusai22\"><code>@​hakusai22</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/firov\"><code>@​firov</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mateusazis\"><code>@​mateusazis</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Mir3605\"><code>@​Mir3605</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.64.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty:Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (1.64.x backport) by <a href=\"https://github.com/larry-safran\"><code>@​larry-safran</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/11303\">grpc/grpc-java#11303</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.64.0</h2>\n<p><em>Avoid upgrading your application to Netty 4.1.111, as there is a possible corruption.
