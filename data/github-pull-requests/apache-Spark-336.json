What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16104 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16134. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n[[SPARK-18675][SQL] CTAS for hive serde table should work for all hive versions](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16104)\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore hive 1.1, when inserting into a table, hive will create the staging directory under a common scratch directory. After the writing is finished, hive will simply empty the table directory and move the staging directory to it.\r\n\r\nAfter hive 1.1, hive will create the staging directory under the table directory, and when moving staging directory to table directory, hive will still empty the table directory, but will exclude the staging directory there.\r\n\r\nIn `InsertIntoHiveTable`, we simply copy the code from hive 1.2, which means we will always create the staging directory under the table directory, no matter what the hive version is. This causes problems if the hive version is prior to 1.1, because the staging directory will be removed by hive when hive is trying to empty the table directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR copies the code from hive 0.13, so that we have 2 branches to create staging directory. If hive version is prior to 1.1, we'll go to the old style branch(i.e. create the staging directory under a common scratch directory), else, go to the new style branch(i.e. create the staging directory under the table directory)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n[[SPARK-18703] [SQL] Drop Staging Directories and Data Files After each Insertion/CTAS of Hive serde Tables](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16134)\r\n\r\nBelow are the files/directories generated for three inserts againsts a Hive table:\r\n```\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/part-00000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first 18 files are temporary.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStatistics in LogicalPlan should use attributes to refer to columns rather than column names, because two columns from two relations can have the same column name. But CatalogTable doesn't have the concepts of attribute or broadcast hint in Statistics.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR audits places using `logicalPlan` in StreamExecution and ensures they all handles the case that `logicalPlan` cannot be created.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also fixes the following issues in `StreamingQueryException`:\r\n- `StreamingQueryException` and `StreamExecution` are cycle-dependent because in the `StreamingQueryException`'s constructor, it calls `StreamExecution`'s `toDebugString` which uses `StreamingQueryException`. Hence it will output `null` value in the error message.\r\n- Duplicated stack trace when calling Throwable.printStackTrace because StreamingQueryException's toString contains the stack trace.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe updated `test(\"max files per trigger - incorrect values\")`. I found this issue when I switched from `testStream` to the real codes to verify the failure in this test.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-17T01:20:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T06:06:05Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T06:05:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4a33ed3e63acaa9d95c513692e8ef5c778a88f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8500e16df5a1baadf9720e6147328500b7e7d4d8","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-18907","ref":"SPARK-18907","sha":"8500e16df5a1baadf9720e6147328500b7e7d4d8","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7a75ee1c9224aa5c2e954fe2a71f9ad506f6782b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we append data to an existing table with `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`, we will do various checks to make sure the appended data is consistent with the existing data.\r\n\r\nHowever, we get the information of the existing table by matching the table relation, instead of looking at the table metadata. This is error-prone, e.g. we only check the number of columns for `HadoopFsRelation`, we forget to check bucketing, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the error checking by looking at the metadata of the existing table, and fix several bugs:\r\n* SPARK-18899: We forget to check if the specified bucketing matched the existing table, which may lead to a problematic table that has different bucketing in different data files.\r\n* SPARK-18912: We forget to check the number of columns for non-file-based data source table\r\n* SPARK-18913: We don't support append data to a table with special column names.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs of Spark 2.1, Spark SQL assumes the machine timezone for datetime manipulation, which is bad if users are not in the same timezones as the machines, or if different users have different timezones.\r\n\r\nWe should introduce a session local timezone setting that is used for execution.\r\n\r\nAn explicit non-goal is locale handling.\r\n\r\n### Semantics\r\n\r\nSetting the session local timezone means that the timezone-aware expressions listed below should use the timezone to evaluate values, and also it should be used to convert (cast) between string and timestamp or between timestamp and date.\r\n\r\n- `CurrentDate`\r\n- `CurrentBatchTimestamp`\r\n- `Hour`\r\n- `Minute`\r\n- `Second`\r\n- `DateFormatClass`\r\n- `ToUnixTimestamp`\r\n- `UnixTimestamp`\r\n- `FromUnixTime`\r\n\r\nand below are implicitly timezone-aware through cast from timestamp to date:\r\n\r\n- `DayOfYear`\r\n- `Year`\r\n- `Quarter`\r\n- `Month`\r\n- `DayOfMonth`\r\n- `WeekOfYear`\r\n- `LastDay`\r\n- `NextDay`\r\n- `TruncDate`\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have timestamp `\"2016-01-01 00:00:00\"` in `GMT`, the values evaluated by some of timezone-aware expressions are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df = Seq(new java.sql.Timestamp(1451606400000L)).toDF(\"ts\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [ts: timestamp]\r\n\r\nscala> df.selectExpr(\"cast(ts as string)\", \"year(ts)\", \"month(ts)\", \"dayofmonth(ts)\", \"hour(ts)\", \"minute(ts)\", \"second(ts)\").show(truncate = false)\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n|ts                 |year(CAST(ts AS DATE))|month(CAST(ts AS DATE))|dayofmonth(CAST(ts AS DATE))|hour(ts)|minute(ts)|second(ts)|\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n|2016-01-01 00:00:00|2016                  |1                      |1                           |0       |0         |0         |\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas setting the session local timezone to `\"PST\"`, they are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"PST\")\r\n\r\nscala> df.selectExpr(\"cast(ts as string)\", \"year(ts)\", \"month(ts)\", \"dayofmonth(ts)\", \"hour(ts)\", \"minute(ts)\", \"second(ts)\").show(truncate = false)\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n|ts                 |year(CAST(ts AS DATE))|month(CAST(ts AS DATE))|dayofmonth(CAST(ts AS DATE))|hour(ts)|minute(ts)|second(ts)|\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n|2015-12-31 16:00:00|2015                  |12                     |31                          |16      |0         |0         |\r\n+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+--------+----------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that even if you set the session local timezone, it affects only in `DataFrame` operations, neither in `Dataset` operations, `RDD` operations nor in `ScalaUDF`s. You need to properly handle timezone by yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Design of the fix\r\n\r\nI introduced an analyzer to pass session local timezone to timezone-aware expressions and modified DateTimeUtils to take the timezone argument.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and added tests for timezone aware expressions.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-16T09:09:06Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T15:05:12Z","closed_at":"2017-01-26T10:53:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"877504d7b9ae960300aae70ce3faacf1e534ea74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6fa1d6a2e09bc103d190377b012158c8a37de5d3","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-18350","ref":"issues/SPARK-18350","sha":"6fa1d6a2e09bc103d190377b012158c8a37de5d3","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\npercentile_approx is the name used in Hive, and approx_percentile is the name used in Presto. approx_percentile is actually more consistent with our approx_count_distinct. Given the cost to alias SQL functions is low (one-liner), it'd be better to just alias them so it is easier to use.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTechnically I could add an end-to-end test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nToday we have different syntax to create data source or hive serde tables, we should unify them to not confuse users and step forward to make hive a data source.\r\n\r\nPlease read https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12843835/CREATE-TABLE.pdf for  details.\r\n\r\nTODO(for follow-up PRs):\r\n1. TBLPROPERTIES is not added to the new syntax, we should decide if we wanna add it later.\r\n2. `SHOW CREATE TABLE` should be updated to use the new syntax.\r\n3. we should decide if we wanna change the behavior of `SET LOCATION`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe History Server (HS) currently only considers completed applications when deleting event logs from spark.history.fs.logDirectory (since SPARK-6879). This means that over time, .inprogress files (from failed jobs, jobs where the SparkContext is not closed, spark-shell exits etc...) can accumulate and impact the HS.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to manually delete these files,  this change add a configurable feature to let user decide if the .inprogress files should also be deleted after a period of time:\r\nspark.history.fs.cleaner.deleteInProgress.enabled\r\nspark.history.fs.cleaner.noProgressMaxAge\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nverified with manual tests\r\nunit tests added in FsHistoryProviderSuite.scala but I am not able to run ./dev/run-tests for the whole project on my laptop, failed on SparkSinkSuite and network related tests uner org.apache.spark.network.* (all due to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we are observing the issue of very high event processing delay in driver's `ListenerBus` for large jobs with many tasks. Many critical component of the scheduler like `ExecutorAllocationManager`, `HeartbeatReceiver` depend on the `ListenerBus` events and this delay might hurt the job performance significantly or even fail the job. For example, a significant delay in receiving the `SparkListenerTaskStart` might cause `ExecutorAllocationManager` manager to mistakenly remove an executor which is not idle.\r\nThe problem is that the event processor in `ListenerBus` is a single thread which loops through all the Listeners for each event and processes each event synchronously https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/LiveListenerBus.scala#L94. This single threaded processor often becomes the bottleneck for large jobs. Also, if one of the Listener is very slow, all the listeners will pay the price of delay incurred by the slow listener. In addition to that a slow listener can cause events to be dropped from the event queue which might be fatal to the job.\r\nTo solve the above problems, we propose to get rid of the event queue and the single threaded event processor. Instead each listener will have its own dedicate single threaded executor service . When ever an event is posted, it will be submitted to executor service of all the listeners. The Single threaded executor service will guarantee in order processing of the events per listener. The queue used for the executor service will be bounded to guarantee we do not grow the memory indefinitely. The downside of this approach is separate event queue per listener will increase the driver memory footprint.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by running the job on the cluster and the average event processing latency dropped from 2 minutes to 3 milliseconds.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-15T02:56:24Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T10:18:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-08T10:18:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b966dcc5a086d6d2eee1bf1fc184f96d96fca0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e09d66ef58049481924dcdf88157bbb981cac7fd","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:skedia/event_log_processing","ref":"skedia/event_log_processing","sha":"e09d66ef58049481924dcdf88157bbb981cac7fd","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter the bug fix in SPARK-18854, TreeNode.apply now returns TreeNode[_] rather than a more specific type. It would be easier for interactive debugging to introduce a function that returns the BaseType.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A - this is a developer only feature used for interactive debugging. As long as it compiles, it should be good to go.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen KafkaSource fails on Kafka errors, we should create a new consumer to retry rather than using the existing broken one because it's possible that the broken one will fail again.\r\n\r\nThis PR also assigns a new group id to the new created consumer for a possible race condition:  the broken consumer cannot talk with the Kafka cluster in `close` but the new consumer can talk to Kafka cluster. I'm not sure if this will happen or not. Just for safety to avoid that the Kafka cluster thinks there are two consumers with the same group id in a short time window. (Note: CachedKafkaConsumer doesn't need this fix since `assign` never uses the group id.)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/70370/console , it ran this flaky test 120 times and all

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to fix for SPARK-18779. When using kafka 0.10.1.0 messages are being read only from one partition. The current kafka-spark 0.10 integration ships with kafka 0.10.0.1 where messages are read from all partitions but using kafka client 0.10.1.0 client, messages are read from only one partition.\r\n\r\nIn the ConsumerStrategy class there is a pause on the consumer. We never resume the consumer and that seems to causing the issue. The KafkaConsumer implementation has changed between 10.0.1 and 10.1.0 which has exposed this issue. The solution to this issue is to resume the consumer before we find the position in DirectKafkaInputDStream class in the latestOffsets method.The reason the issue is not seen in the current setup is because pause/resume logic is changed in the latest kafka version. We dont seem to have a resume for the pause and hence this fix is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe spark-kafka test cases were run to check no regressions were caused. I have checked that messages are being read from all partitions for both 0.10.0.1 kafka client and 0.10.1.0

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a bug introduced by subquery handling. numberedTreeString (which uses generateTreeString under the hood) numbers trees including innerChildren (used to print subqueries), but apply (which uses getNodeNumbered) ignores innerChildren. As a result, apply(i) would return the wrong plan node if there are subqueries.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case in SubquerySuite.scala to test both the depth-first traversal of numbering as well as making sure the two methods are consistent.","created_at":"2016-12-14T06:58:23Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T00:14:44Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T00:14:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1796da0f902a1e599cdb0f16f0d579421072d131","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e79306f2f187587e50c1300150df8ba6a94a4691","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18854","ref":"SPARK-18854","sha":"e79306f2f187587e50c1300150df8ba6a94a4691","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch reduces the default number element estimation for arrays and maps from 100 to 1. The issue with the 100 number is that when nested (e.g. an array of map), 100 * 100 would be used as the default size. This sounds like just an overestimation which doesn't seem that bad (since it is usually better to overestimate than underestimate). However, due to the way we assume the size output for Project (new estimated column size / old estimated column size), this overestimation can become underestimation. It is actually in general in this case safer to assume 1 default element.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis should be covered by existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a small race in SchedulerIntegrationSuite.\r\nThe test assumes that the taskscheduler thread\r\nprocessing that last task will finish before the DAGScheduler processes\r\nthe task event and notifies the job waiter, but that is not 100%\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nran the test locally a bunch of times, never failed, though admittedly it never failed locally for me either.  However I am nearly 100% certain this is what caused the failure of one jenkins build https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/68694/consoleFull (which is long gone now,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current way of resolving `InsertIntoTable` and `CreateTable` is convoluted: sometimes we replace them with concrete implementation commands during analysis, sometimes during planning phase.\r\n\r\nAnd the error checking logic is also a mess: we may put it in extended analyzer rules, or extended checking rules, or `CheckAnalysis`.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the data source analysis:\r\n\r\n1.  `InsertIntoTable` and `CreateTable` are always unresolved and need to be replaced by concrete implementation commands during analysis.\r\n2. The error checking logic is mainly in 2 rules: `PreprocessTableCreation` and `PreprocessTableInsertion`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

apply PushProjectionThroughUnion rule ,as the output attributes of a union are always equal to the left child's output, so it will throw a exception that the left child do not contain an attribute of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, some tests are being failed and hanging on Windows due to this problem. For the reason in SPARK-18718, some tests using `local-cluster` mode were disabled on Windows due to the length limitation by paths given to classpaths.\r\n\r\nThe limitation seems roughly 32K (see the [blog in MS](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031210-00/?p=41553/) and [another reference](https://support.thoughtworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/213248526-Getting-around-maximum-command-line-length-is-32767-characters-on-Windows)) but in `local-cluster` mode, executors were being launched as processes with the command such as [here](https://gist.github.com/HyukjinKwon/5bc81061c250d4af5a180869b59d42ea) in (only) tests.\r\n\r\nThis length is roughly 40K due to the classpaths given to `java` command. However, it seems duplicates are almost half of them. So, if we deduplicate the paths, it seems reduced to roughly 20K with the command, [here](https://gist.github.com/HyukjinKwon/dad0c8db897e5e094684a2dc6a417790).\r\n\r\nMaybe, we should consider as some more paths are added in the future but it seems better than disabling all the tests for now with minimised changes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to deduplicate the paths in classpaths in case of launching executors as processes in `local-cluster` mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests in `ShuffleSuite` and `BroadcastJoinSuite` manually via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a timeout failure when using `rdd.toLocalIterator()` or `df.toLocalIterator()` for a PySpark RDD and DataFrame:\r\n\r\n    df = spark.createDataFrame([[1],[2],[3]])\r\n    it = df.toLocalIterator()\r\n    row = next(it)\r\n\r\n    df2 = df.repartition(1000)  # create many empty partitions which increase materialization time so causing timeout \r\n    it2 = df2.toLocalIterator() \r\n    row = next(it2)\r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue is, we open a socket to serve the data from JVM side. We set timeout for connection and reading through the socket in Python side. In Python we use a generator to read the data, so we only begin to connect the socket once we start to ask data from it. If we don't consume it immediately, there is connection timeout.\r\n\r\nIn the other side, the materialization time for RDD partitions is unpredictable. So we can't set a timeout for reading data through the socket. Otherwise, it is very possibly to fail.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests into PySpark.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.","created_at":"2016-12-13T05:56:49Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:11Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T21:14:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ac8107077fa6c4769ce869a8a8814ff112423ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16263/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16263/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16263/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e02695efab1c6b42578e52c74c18b60cb74dec78","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-pyspark-localiterator","ref":"fix-pyspark-localiterator","sha":"e02695efab1c6b42578e52c74c18b60cb74dec78","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

All of them UTC formatted strings.\r\n\r\n- Renamed `StreamingQuery.timestamp` to `StreamingQueryProgress.triggerTimestamp` to differentiate from `queryTimestamps`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the tests failed on Windows as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - pipe with empty partition *** FAILED *** (672 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   Set(0, 4, 5) did not equal Set(0, 5, 6) (PipedRDDSuite.scala:145)\r\n[info]   org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException:\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `wc -c` counts the characters on both Windows and Linux but the newlines characters on Windows are `\\r\\n` which are two. So, the counts ends up one more for each.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - test pipe exports map_input_file *** FAILED *** (62 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Subprocess exited with status 1. Command ran: printenv map_input_file\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.rdd.PipedRDD$$anon$1.hasNext(PipedRDD.scala:178)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - test pipe exports mapreduce_map_input_file *** FAILED *** (172 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Subprocess exited with status 1. Command ran: printenv mapreduce_map_input_file\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.rdd.PipedRDD$$anon$1.hasNext(PipedRDD.scala:178)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`printenv` command prints the environment variables; however, when environment variables are set to `ProcessBuilder` as lower-cased keys, `printenv` in Windows ignores and does not print this although it is actually set and accessible. (this was tested in [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spark-test/spark/build/208-PipedRDDSuite) for upper-cases with this [diff](https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...spark-test:74d39da) and [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spark-test/spark/build/203-PipedRDDSuite) for lower-cases with this [diff](https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...spark-test:fde5e37f28032c15a8d8693ba033a8a779a26317). It seems a bug in `printenv`.\r\n(BTW, note that environment variables on Windows are case-insensitive).\r\n\r\nThis is (I believe) a thirdparty tool on Windows that resembles `printenv` on Linux (installed in AppVeyor environment or Windows Server 2012 R2). This command does not exist, at least, for Windows 7 and 10 (manually tested).\r\n\r\nOn Windows, we can use `cmd.exe /C set [varname]` officially for this purpose. We could fix the tests with this in order to test if the environment variable is set. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSet the default location of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` to be compliant with the CRAN policy (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) regarding writing files outside of the tmp directory. Previously a folder named `spark-warehouse` was created in the working directory when `sparkR.session()` was called.\r\n\r\nSee SPARK-15799 for discussion.\r\ncc @shivaram \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test and manually verified nothing was created in my working directory after running the following code:\r\n```R\r\nsparkR.session(master = \"local[*]\",\r\n

issue and hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n\r\nSince #15620 only fix the code size limitation problem, we can simplify the test to avoid hitting constants pool size limitation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded a `to` call at the end of the code generated by `ScalaReflection.deserializerFor` if the requested type is not a supertype of `WrappedArray[_]` that uses `CanBuildFrom[_, _, _]` to convert result into an arbitrary subtype of `Seq[_]`.\r\n\r\nCare was taken to preserve the original deserialization where it is possible to avoid the overhead of conversion in cases where it is not needed\r\n\r\n`ScalaReflection.serializerFor` could already be used to serialize any `Seq[_]` so it was not altered\r\n\r\n`SQLImplicits` had to be altered and new implicit encoders added to permit serialization of other sequence types\r\n\r\nAlso fixes [SPARK-16815] Dataset[List[T]] leads to ArrayStoreException\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package && ./dev/run-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso manual execution of the following sets of commands in the Spark shell:\r\n```scala\r\ncase class TestCC(key: Int, letters: List[String])\r\n\r\nval ds1 = sc.makeRDD(Seq(\r\n(List(\"D\")),\r\n(List(\"S\",\"H\")),\r\n(List(\"F\",\"H\")),\r\n(List(\"D\",\"L\",\"L\"))\r\n)).map(x=>(x.length,x)).toDF(\"key\",\"letters\").as[TestCC]\r\n\r\nval test1=ds1.map{_.key}\r\ntest1.show\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class X(l:

sequence support also tested with the following commands:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class QueueClass(q: scala.collection.immutable.Queue[Int])\r\n\r\nspark.createDataset(Seq(List(1,2,3))).map(x =>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen you start a stream, if we are trying to resolve the source of the stream, for example if we need to resolve partition columns, this could take a long time. This long execution time should not block the main thread where `query.start()` was called on. It should happen in the stream execution thread possibly before starting any triggers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added. Made sure test fails with no code changes.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-09T21:44:41Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:58:54Z","closed_at":"2016-12-10T06:52:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef579d60489c4ab78137676f4cc6174fb0e5be78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6d1e251097cc5a71ef67dec995f5cf86f977891","head":{"label":"brkyvz:SPARK-18811","ref":"SPARK-18811","sha":"e6d1e251097cc5a71ef67dec995f5cf86f977891","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

This PR performs casts after we can ensure the value is within range of signed integer (the result of `max(array.length, ???)` is always integer).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe should be able to resolve a nested view. The main advantage is that if you update an underlying view, the current view also gets updated.\r\nThe new approach should be compatible with older versions of SPARK/HIVE, that means:\r\n1. The new approach should be able to resolve the views that created by older versions of SPARK/HIVE;\r\n2. The new approach should be able to resolve the views that are currently supported by SPARK SQL.\r\n\r\nThe new approach mainly brings in the following changes:\r\n1. Add a new operator called `View` to keep track of the CatalogTable that describes the view, and the output attributes as well as the child of the view;\r\n2. Update the `ResolveRelations` rule to resolve the relations and views, note that a nested view should be resolved correctly;\r\n3. Add `viewDefaultDatabase` variable to `CatalogTable` to keep track of the default database name used to resolve a view, if the `CatalogTable` is not a view, then the variable should be `None`;\r\n4. Add `AnalysisContext` to enable us to still support a view created with CTE/Windows query;\r\n5. Enables the view support without enabling Hive support (i.e., enableHiveSupport);\r\n6. Fix a weird behavior: the result of a view query may have different schema if the referenced table has been changed. After this PR, we try to cast the child output attributes to that from the view schema, throw an AnalysisException if cast is not allowed.\r\n\r\nNote this is compatible with the views defined by older versions of Spark(before 2.2), which have empty `defaultDatabase` and all the relations in `viewText` have database part defined.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. Explicitly prevent Insert into View or Create View As Insert;\r\n2. Parse the view query in HiveSessionCatalog;\r\n3. Alias the view with its child by mapping the columns by index;\r\n4. Limit the depth of a nested view;\r\n5. Remove SQLBuilder for operators.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add new tests in `SessionCatalogSuite` to test the function `lookupRelation`;\r\n2. Add new test case in `SQLViewSuite` to test resolve a nested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`UnsafeKVExternalSorter` uses `UnsafeInMemorySorter` to sort the records of `BytesToBytesMap` if it is given a map.\r\n\r\nCurrently we use the number of keys in `BytesToBytesMap` to determine if the array used for sort is enough or not. We has an assert that ensures the size of the array is enough: `map.numKeys() <= map.getArray().size() / 2`.\r\n\r\nHowever, each record in the map takes two entries in the array, one is record pointer, another is key prefix. So the correct assert should be `map.numKeys() * 2 <= map.getArray().size() / 2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome places in SQL may call `RpcEndpointRef.askWithRetry` (e.g., ParquetFileFormat.buildReader -> SparkContext.broadcast -> ... -> BlockManagerMaster.updateBlockInfo -> RpcEndpointRef.askWithRetry), which will finally call `Await.result`. It may cause `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: spark.sql.execution.id is already set` when running in Scala ForkJoinPool.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes to fix this issue:\r\n\r\n- Remove `ThreadUtils.awaitResult`\r\n- Rename `ThreadUtils. awaitResultInForkJoinSafely` to `ThreadUtils.awaitResult`\r\n- Replace `Await.result` in RpcTimeout with `ThreadUtils.awaitResult`.\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport cardinality estimation and stats propagation for all join types.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n- For inner/outer joins without any equal condition, we estimate it like cartesian product.\r\n- For left semi/anti joins, since we can't apply the heuristics for inner join to it, for now we just propagate the statistics from left side. We should support them when other advanced stats (e.g. histograms) are available in spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a new test
