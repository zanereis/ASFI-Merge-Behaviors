`couch_replicator_httpc:setup/1`, if the URL contains basic auth\ncredentials, the replicator now removes those credentials from the URL\nand inserts them into a new ets table, whose identifier is stored in the\nreturned `httpdb` record in a new field named `credentials`.\n\nThen, if during replication there's a HTTP status code 401, the\nreplicator does a POST-request to the remote DB's `/_session` endpoint,\nin which the request body contains the user name and password from the\nbasic auth credentials stored in the ets table.  If that request is\nsuccessful, the session cookie is inserted into the ets table together\nwith the current timestamp returned by `os:timestamp/0`.  From that\npoint on, `couch_replicator_httpc:send_req/3` always retrieves the\ncookie from the ets table and sets it as value in the \"Cookie\" request\nheader.  When a new session cookie is set, the cookie value, together\nwith a new timestamp, will be updated in the ets table accordingly.\nNow, after having started a new session, the request that generated the\nresponse status code 401 is repeated.\n\nIn order to prevent the replicator from wrongly starting a new session\nafter getting a 401 status code and then repeating the request again\n(and thereby causing an infinite loop), it is checked whether the\ndifference between the current timestamp returned by `os:timestamp/0`\nand the timestamp stored together with the session cookie is greater\nthan one minute.  A new session is started and the request is repeated\nonly if the difference is greater than one minute.  Otherwise it is\nproceeded as ever, i.e., the response with the 401 status code

adds a rebar plugin to bootstrap to tmp test environment with data folders and the relevant ini files. To run this right now you'll need to `cp src/couch/priv/couchjs bin/couchjs` until we figure out how to handle that properly.\n\nOne issue with the setup_eunit command is that the rebar templates require all variables to be defined in order to overwrite them. So I've set default destinations of `/tmp`, which I'm not convinced is great. The test suite won't run, but it will create the files and folders in there. One hacky solution would be to use `/somelongdirectorythatdoesntexist` that will cause rebar to explode, but I'm not a huge fan of that approach.\n","created_at":"2014-08-29T20:53:22Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T20:07:18Z","closed_at":"2014-09-05T21:17:44Z","merged_at":"2014-09-05T21:17:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"5701cea2208a35e9d86dd49b01958c046056ada6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/95da8e13d1ccfdba2f2eaf68bd8bec501aa1280c","head":{"label":"apache:1963-eunit-bigcouch","ref":"1963-eunit-bigcouch","sha":"95da8e13d1ccfdba2f2eaf68bd8bec501aa1280c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

PR replaces etap test with eunit.\n\nIssues with etap:\n1. It's etap (:\n2. Almost for all suites each next test depends from the state of previous one\n3. Lack of integration with rebar out of box\n4. Badly organization\n\nGoals:\n1. Refresh test suite: split and isolate each test case\n2. Find and get rid heisenbugs\n3. Make test suite ready for CouchDB 2.0 build system\n\nConsiderations:\n1. Each target test function name reflects the test goal\n2. Each target test function starts with `should_` prefix to 1) separate test functions from helper ones 2) make names more clean\n3. Otherwise test has description or reference to couchdb issue\n4. Test suites which tests specific module named as this module is\n5. Otherwise they starts with more common \"couchdb_\" prefix\n6. Tests output should be human friendly\n\nFixed issues (at least):\n- Timeouts are reduced to meanful values, all timer:sleep are removed unless they are required for test logic\n- 073-changes.t: heartbeats count is very depended from host's performance\n- 090-task-status.t: get_task_prop silently resets Acc if searched task isn't last in the list\n- 140-attachments-comp.t: zlib:gzip only worked for small attachments\n- 201-view-group-shutdown.t: race condition for {error, all_dbs_active} assertion check. Previously was solved by timer:sleep.\n\nSome stats:\n- CouchDB: \n  - Etap:\n    - Files=52, Tests=1219\n    - time make check  107.92s user 11.17s system 35% cpu 5:38.20 total\n  - Eunit:\n    - Files=29, Tests=693\n    - time make check  74.41s user 11.68s system 51% cpu 2:48.48 total\n- couch_mrview:\n  - Etap:\n    - Files=7, Tests=41\n    - time make check  3.02s user 0.79s system 73% cpu 5.191 total\n  - Eunit:\n    - Files=7, Tests=39\n    - time make check  1.48s user 0.32s system 52% cpu 3.405 total\n- couch_replicator:\n  - Etap:\n    - Files=7, Tests=1832\n    - time make check  115.11s user 13.94s system 81% cpu 2:37.98 total\n  - Eunit:\n    - Files=7, Tests=127\n    - time make check  133.73s user 15.99s system 89% cpu 2:47.51 total\n\n(Notice: as for etap each \"test\" actually means the assertion)\n\nExpected output: https://www.friendpaste.com/2MCgzw3g18ATOWyLGBSQwZ\n\nNotice: I'd ran tests both on fast and slow environment (single cored virtualbox with 40% cpu cap), so execution timeouts fits both. However, I'm not sure about all possible configurations, so if any test fails with _timeout_ for you please include in your report your system configuration - it\n\nNotice: [error] messages in output is _FINE_ - they happens because `log=none` doesn't disables logging completely, allowing error messages to be emit out.\n\nP.S. All commits after \"Goodbye etap!\" will be squashed before

a string-edit windows (as briefly discussed in COUCHDB-2160): when the cursor is on a line that contains a JSON-String (possibly with encoded quotes / newlines), one can open a textarea containing the unescaped text. This can replace much of what the field-edit view of futon could do - and it should help a lot with editing javascript for design docs or e.g. Angular with couch (when the code is actually contained in documents). Feedback is highly

auth works by checking what roles a user has and then decide if\nthey have access to a specific route. The only problem is a regular user\nmight get created but not have any roles. Unlike an admin user who get\nassigned all the roles on creation.\n\nThe idea behind this is that certain routes should require a user to be\nlogged in but not necessary have any roles eg. #changePassword route.\n\nThis allows for a standard fauxton role that all logged in users get given so that\nwe can check via the roles if they are

This commit changes the way heartbeat is sent, instead of\nsending a newline character, it sends an empty event of type heartbeat:\n\n```\nevent: heartbeat\ndata:\n```\n\nThis event doesn't have an id: field, so the client will retain its latest Last-Event-ID state.\n\nThis doesn't change the expectations of clients that used EventSource till now, because they\nsubscribe to the 'message' event type. To get the 'heartbeat' events a client will need to\nexplicitly subscribe to it:\n\n```\nsource.addEventListener('heartbeat', function () { /* cancel a timer that would otherwise reconnect the source

refactored the Activetasks. \n\nI was able to delete far more code than adding new code (even with the whitepsace removals and code formatting) and implementing new stuff that operates on the collection should now get pretty straightforward. \n\nI separated the remove whitespace commit and another one, but I can squash / rebase.\n\nHere is what I did:\n- do not use a model as a kind of collection, directly operate on the\n  collection which gets filtered for the view\n- remove the view DataSection which acted as layer to fetch collections from\n  the model and passed it to a view\n- remove not used html-template\n- format code\n\nThis is the base for COUCHDB-2125 / #204 but the feature might need some concept and style which could take some time\n","created_at":"2014-04-08T19:48:22Z","updated_at":"2014-06-14T08:07:55Z","closed_at":"2014-05-15T19:47:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8176ae9d0884503de154e4084a1716d8ca5c9cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/f8cf3106eaf20e967defec630665e4e293799fdb","head":{"label":"robertkowalski:2125-sort-tasks-refactor","ref":"2125-sort-tasks-refactor","sha":"f8cf3106eaf20e967defec630665e4e293799fdb","user":{"login":"robertkowalski","id":298166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski","html_url":"https://github.com/robertkowalski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":14823936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDgyMzkzNg==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"robertkowalski/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertkowalski","id":298166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski","html_url":"https://github.com/robertkowalski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertkowalski/couchdb","description":"dev-repo

everybody can have a look.\n\nI find the tabs very useful, but maybe they should be positioned `fixed` so it's always in the screen and not just on scrolldown.\n\n**Merge with caution**: if it is planned that e.g. `Config` will get a fixed header like most views, the padding for tabs makes sense. If not and there would be tabs added, the tabs would have too much space to the top.\n- Should we keep the tabs?\n- Will all screens get this fixed

is a new version of pagination in Fauxton using skip. It uses a `PagingCollection` that has the main algorithm for pagination and exposes a nice api.\n\nThis is an intermediate step as this is a much better pagination than we have at the moment. However using just skip for pagination is not optimal as there are two cases where skip pagination fails - For very large skips and for when documents that a user have paginated past have been deleted. \n\nThe next step once this has landed will be to add in a `startkey_docid` pagination as well. The PagingCollection would then decided which method to use to paginate for an index.\n","created_at":"2014-03-25T16:01:06Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T17:19:49Z","closed_at":"2014-04-10T10:02:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c9c5a12669a78be72e52eca7b4d61a4c5a1786f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/194/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/194/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/194/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/f69fdb4dc7ab7bed63d69790bc617e5a72870b83","head":{"label":"garrensmith:skip-paginate","ref":"skip-paginate","sha":"f69fdb4dc7ab7bed63d69790bc617e5a72870b83","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fbc0545e39d7871afc469f3079dee67f823f3220","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
