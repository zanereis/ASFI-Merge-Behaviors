PR should help address the flakiness in the ConsumerBounceTest#testRollingBrokerRestartsWithSmallerMaxGroupSizeConfigDisruptsBigGroup test (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7965). I tested this locally and have verified it significantly reduces flakiness - 25/25 tests now pass. Running the test 25 times in trunk, I'd get `18/25` passes.\r\n\r\nIt does so by reusing the less-flaky consumer integration testing functionality inside `BaseConsumerTest`. Most notably, the test now makes use of the `ConsumerAssignmentPoller` class  - each consumer now polls non-stop rather than the more batch-oriented polling we had in `ConsumerBounceTest#waitForRebalance()`.","created_at":"2019-02-07T21:36:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T20:08:05Z","closed_at":"2019-04-05T20:08:04Z","merged_at":"2019-04-05T20:08:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc4fde35c9cc2818af1bcb6861ce32dee0f41677","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

test `org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.rest.RestServerTest#testCORSEnabled` assumes Jersey client can send restricted HTTP headers(`Origin`).\r\n\r\nJersey client uses `sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection`.\r\n`sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection` drops restricted headers(`Host`, `Keep-Alive`, `Origin`, etc) based on static property `allowRestrictedHeaders`.\r\nThis property is initialized in a static block by reading Java system property `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders`.\r\n\r\nSo, if classloader loads `HttpURLConnection` before we set `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true`, then all subsequent changes of this system property won't take any effect(which happens if `org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ExampleConnectIntegrationTest` is executed before `RestServerTest`).\r\nTo prevent this, we have to either make sure we set `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders=true` as early as possible or do not rely on this system property at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test dependency on `httpcomponents-client` which doesn't depend on `sun.net.http.allowRestrictedHeaders` system property.

Kafka Client will go to AUTHENTICATION_FAILED state.`\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the problem begins at this point in the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2.0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/oauthbearer/internals/expiring/ExpiringCredentialRefreshingLogin.java#L378:\r\n\r\nThe `loginContext` field doesn't get replaced with the old version stored away in the `optionalLoginContextToLogout` variable if/when the `loginContext.login()` call on line 381 throws an exception. This is an unusual event – the OAuth authorization server must be unavailable at the moment when the token refresh occurs – but when it does happen it puts the refresher thread instance in an invalid state because now its `loginContext` field represents the one that failed instead of the original one, which is now lost. The current `loginContext` can't be logged out – it will throw an `InvalidStateException` if that is attempted because there is no token associated with it – and the token associated with the login context that was lost can never be logged out and removed from the Subject's private credentials (because we don't retain a reference to it). The net effect is that we end up with an extra token on the Subject's private credentials, which eventually results in the exception mentioned above when the client tries to authenticate to a broker.\r\n\r\nSo the chain of events is:\r\n\r\n1.  login failure upon token refresh causes the refresher thread's login context field to be incorrect, and the existing token on the Subject's private credentials will never be logged out/removed\r\n2. retry occurs in 10 seconds, potentially repeatedly until the authorization server is back online\r\n3. login succeeds, adding a second token to the Subject's private credentials (logout is then called on the login context set incorrectly in the most recent failure – e.g. in step 1 – which results in an exception, but this is not the real issue – it is the 2 tokens on the Subject's private credentials that is the issue)\r\n4. At this point we now have 2 tokens on the Subject, and then at some point in the future the client tries to make a new connection, it sees the 2 tokens and throws an exception – BOOM! The client is now unable to connect (or re-authenticate if applicable) going forward.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-06T15:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T17:05:03Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T18:06:02Z","merged_at":"2019-02-07T18:06:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f7e6b291309286e3e3c1610e98d978773c9d504","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b2dc7546fa073977ad9ea971ba8cf35e41be3da3","head":{"label":"rondagostino:KAFKA-7902","ref":"KAFKA-7902","sha":"b2dc7546fa073977ad9ea971ba8cf35e41be3da3","user":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117853091,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTc4NTMwOTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"rondagostino/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino/kafka","description":"Mirror

This is also my first PR into Kafka.. if packaging like this belongs elsewhere, please let me know where I should propose it.]\r\n\r\nStrict confinement is used; all processes are run in an apparmor-restricted environment with access to the network and removable-media on the host. removable-media allows the use of mounted volumes for the log directory.\r\n\r\nKafka and zookeeper are installed as systemd services for a nice standalone, out-of-the-box, no-configuration-necessary experience. You install the snap and kafka is running on localhost. The zookeeper service can be disabled if an external zookeeper is used instead.\r\n\r\nThe snap build requires snapcraft 3.0 and multipass.

may be updated from the background thread, so we need to protect access to SubscriptionState. This patch restructures the metadata handling so that we only check pattern subscriptions in the foreground. Additionally, it improves the following:\r\n\r\n1. SubscriptionState is now the source of truth for the topics that will be fetched. We had a lot of messy logic previously to try and keep the the topic set in Metadata consistent with the subscription, so this simplifies the logic.\r\n2. The metadata needs for the producer and consumer are quite different, so it made sense to separate the custom logic into separate extensions of Metadata. For example, only the producer requires topic expiration.\r\n3. We've always had an edge case in which a metadata change with an inflight request may cause us to effectively miss an expected update. This patch implements a separate version inside Metadata which is bumped when the needed topics changes.\r\n4. This patch removes the MetadataListener, which was the cause of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7764. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

Since most subclasses of `ShutdownableThread` put cleanup logic in `ShutdownableThread.shutdown()`, being able to call `shutdown()` on the non-running thread would be useful.\r\n\r\nThis change allows us to avoid blocking in `ShutdownableThread.shutdown()` if the thread's `run()` method has not been called. We also add a check that `initiateShutdown()` was called before `awaitShutdown()`, to protect against the case where a user calls `awaitShutdown()` before the thread has been started, and unexpectedly is not blocked on the thread shutting down. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

a partition is marked offline due to a failed disk, the leader is supposed to not shrink its ISR any more. In `ReplicaManager#maybeShrinkIsr`, we iterate through all non-offline partitions to shrink the ISR. If an ISR needs to shrink, we need to write the new ISR to ZK, which can take a bit of time. In this window, some partitions could now be marked as offline, but may not be picked up by the iterator. This is because the offline partition iterator used in `ReplicaManager#maybeShrinkIsr` is weakly consistent and does not necessarily reflect the updated offline state.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the above issue by iterating through all topic partitions and checking whether the partition has been made offline within the iteration. This helps ensure we detect a partition being made offline during the iteration and prevent ISRs from shrinking thereof.","created_at":"2019-01-25T23:18:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-26T06:30:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-26T03:40:51Z","merged_at":"2019-01-26T03:40:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"646ec948794c927e4ffa5f96d60b5b9f7fe8f228","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/80cebecc431d171ec6281c921860a1d521b9cb89","head":{"label":"dhruvilshah3:shrink-offline-partitions","ref":"shrink-offline-partitions","sha":"80cebecc431d171ec6281c921860a1d521b9cb89","user":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121815241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE4MTUyNDE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dhruvilshah3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3/kafka","description":"Mirror

In the caching layer's flush listener call, we should always write to the underlying store, before flushing (see https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4331 's point 4) for detailed explanation). When fixing 4331, it only touches on KV stores, but it turns out that we should fix for window and session store as well.\r\n\r\n2) Also apply the optimization that was in session-store already: when the new value bytes and old value bytes are all null (this is possible e.g. if there is a put(K, V) followed by a remove(K) or put(K, null) and these two operations only hit the cache), upon flushing this mean the underlying store does not have this value at all and also no intermediate value has been sent to downstream as well. We can skip both putting a null to the underlying store as well as calling the flush listener sending `null -> null` in this case.\r\n\r\nModifies corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer

is the first diff for the implementation of JoinGroup logic for static membership. The goal of this diff contains:\r\n\r\n1. Add `group.instance.id` to be unique identifier for consumer instances, provided by end user;\r\n2. Modify group coordinator to accept JoinGroupRequest with/without static membership, refactor the logic for readability and code reusability.\r\n3. Add client side support for incorporating static membership changes, including new config for `group.instance.id`, apply stream thread client id by default, and new join group exception handling.\r\n4. Remove `internal.leave.on.close` config by checking whether `group.instance.id` is defined. Effectively speaking, only dynamic member will send LeaveGroupRequest while static membership expiration is only controlled through session timeout.\r\n5. Increase max session timeout to 30 min for more user flexibility if they are inclined to tolerate partial unavailability than burdening rebalance.\r\n6. Unit tests for each module changes, especially on the group coordinator logic. Crossing the possibilities like:\r\n  6.1 Dynamic/Static member\r\n  6.2 Known/Unknown member id\r\n  6.3 Group stable/unstable\r\n  6.4 Leader/Follower\r\n\r\nThe hope here is to merge this logic before 2.2 code freeze so that we (as Pinterest) could start experimenting on the core logic ASAP.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the 345 change will be broken down to 4 separate diffs:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid kicking out members through rebalance.timeout, only do the kick out through session timeout.\r\n2. Changes around LeaveGroup logic, including version bumping, broker logic, client logic, etc.\r\n3. Admin client changes to add ability to batch remove static members\r\n4. Deprecate group.initial.rebalance.delay\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts @guozhangwang @hachikuji @stanislavkozlovski @MayureshGharat @kkonstantine @lindong28 @Ishiihara @shawnsnguyen , thanks!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

integration test framework for Connect provides a `org.apache.kafka.connect.util.clusters.EmbeddedConnectCluster#connectorStatus` method that checks the status of a Connector via the REST endpoint and deserializes the response into a `ConnectorStateInfo` object. If the connector creation request has just been finished, and task creation delayed for some reason (for example, rebalancing is ongoing), the REST API returns a 404 on the `connectors/{connectorName}/status` endpoint, and causes the test to fail with the exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-01-19 03:47:59,289] (Test worker) ERROR Could not read connector state

method uses varargs to supply predicates and returns array of streams ('[Each stream in the result array corresponds position-wise (index) to the predicate in the supplied predicates](http://home.apache.org/~ijuma/kafka-0.10.0.1-rc1/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KStream.html)'). \r\n\r\nThis is poor API design that makes building branches very inconvenient because of 'impedance mismatch' between arrays and generics in Java language.\r\n\r\n * In general, the code  have low cohesion: we need to define predicates in one place, and respective stream processors in another place of code. \r\n \r\n * If the number of predicates is predefined, this method forces us to use 'magic numbers' to extract the right branch from the result (see examples [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48950580/kafka-streams-send-on-different-topics-depending-on-streams-data)).\r\n \r\n * If we need to build branches dynamically (e. g. one branch per enum value) we inevitably have to deal with 'generic arrays' and 'unchecked typecasts'.\r\n \r\nThe proposed class `KafkaStreamBrancher` introduces new standard way to build branches on top of KStream. \r\n\r\nInstead of \r\n\r\n```java\r\nKStream<String, String> source_o365_user_activity = builder.stream(\"source\");\r\nKStream<String, String>[] branches = source_o365_user_activity.branch( \r\n

);\r\n\r\nbranches[0].to(\"A\");\r\nbranches[1].to(\"B\");\r\nbranches[2].to(\"C\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can use\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew KafkaStreamsBrancher<String, String>()\r\n   .branch((key, value) -> value.contains(\"A\"), ks->ks.to(\"A\"))\r\n   .branch((key, value) -> value.contains(\"B\"), ks->ks.to(\"B\"))\r\n   //default branch should not necessarily be defined in the end!\r\n   .defaultBranch(ks->ks.to(\"C\"))\r\n   .onTopOf(builder.stream(\"source\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

return any sessions whose end > earliestEnd and whose start < latestStart.\r\n\r\nI've tried various ways to fix it completely and I ended up having to add a single-point query to the public ReadOnlySessionStore API for the exact needed semantics. It is used for flushing to read the old values (otherwise the wrong old values will be sent downstreams, hence it is a correctness issue) and also for getting the value for value-getters (it is for

patch changes the behavior of KafkaProducer.waitOnMetadata to wait up to max.block.ms when the partition specified in the produce request is out of the range of partitions present in the metadata. This improves the user experience in the case when partitions are added to a topic and a client attempts to produce to one of the new partitions before the metadata has propagated to the brokers.
