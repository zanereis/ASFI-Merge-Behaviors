What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupports for Python UDTF to analyze in Python.\r\n\r\nThe Python UDTF can have `analyze` static method in the UDTF class instead of specifying a static `returnType`.\r\nThe `analyze` function will be called during the analysis phase, in the Driver node, so this also updates `PythonWorkerFactory` to be reusable.\r\n\r\nThe function will take arguments corresponding to its inputs:\r\n\r\n- The number and order of arguments are the same as the UDTF inputs\r\n- Each argument is a `pyspark.sql.udtf.AnalyzeArgument`, containing:\r\n    - `data_type: DataType`\r\n    - `value: Any`: if the argument is foldable; otherwise `None`\r\n    - `is_table: bool`: `True` if the argument is `TABLE`\r\n\r\nand it should return `pyspark.sql.udtf.AnalyzeResult`, containing:\r\n\r\n- `schema: StructType`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udtf\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.udtf import AnalyzeArgument, AnalyzeResult\r\n>>> # or from pyspark.sql.functions import udtf, AnalyzeArgument, AnalyzeResult\r\n>>> class TestUDTF:\r\n...     @staticmethod\r\n...     def analyze(a: AnalyzeArgument, b: AnalyzeArgument) -> AnalyzeResult:\r\n...         return AnalyzeResult(StructType().add(\"a\", a.data_type).add(\"b\", b.data_type))\r\n...     def eval(self, a, b):\r\n...         yield a, b\r\n...\r\n>>> func = udtf(TestUDTF)\r\n>>> spark.udtf.register(\"test_udtf\", func)\r\n\r\n>>> df1 = func(lit(1), lit(\"x\"))\r\n>>> df1.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> df1.show()\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  b|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  x|\r\n+---+---+\r\n\r\n>>> df2 = sql(\"SELECT * FROM test_udtf(1.0d, 1.2f)\")\r\n>>> df2.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: double (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: float (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> df2.show()\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  b|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|1.0|1.2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make Python UDTF analyze the arguments and decide its return type by the given arguments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can define `analyze` static method in the UDTF class instead of specifying a static return type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.","created_at":"2023-07-11T23:34:02Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T04:03:16Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T03:46:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0295b061413935bc64abd8fcf1d8f1cd6374aff5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e2b6befbd015fcdad1ddf6ccecd79a630ac7d60","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-44380/analyze_in_python","ref":"issues/SPARK-44380/analyze_in_python","sha":"4e2b6befbd015fcdad1ddf6ccecd79a630ac7d60","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces the FunctionPickler utility class that will be responsible for pickling class and their arguments, creating scripts that will run those functions and pickle their output, as well as extracting objects from a pickle file. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is used to abstract away the responsibility of pickling from the TorchDistributor, as that is relatively tangential to the actual distributed training. Additionally, for future distributors or anything that uses pickling to transmit objects, this class can prove useful with built-in functionalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWrote unit tests.\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] Pickles a function and its arguments to a file.\r\n- [x] Creates a file that will execute that, given a path to pickled functions and arguments, run the function and arguments and then pickle the output to another location.\r\n- [x] Extracts output given a pickle file.\r\n- [x] Unit tests for first feature.\r\n- [x] Unit tests for second feature.\r\n- [x] Unit tests for third feature.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-11T22:08:15Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T06:56:14Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T21:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14f5bda6082bdee39d0a300b22d2e7ad0bdebafd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aaa9bfed5c6b5af968bf97ce76a71abc23a3cef7","head":{"label":"mathewjacob1002:function_pickler","ref":"function_pickler","sha":"aaa9bfed5c6b5af968bf97ce76a71abc23a3cef7","user":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659420972,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ033LA","name":"spark","full_name":"mathewjacob1002/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mathewjacob1002","id":134338709,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAHYlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134338709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002","html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mathewjacob1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mathewjacob1002/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following situation has led to Java tests no longer be executed when performing maven tests on the core module:\r\n\r\n1.  SPARK-44316 upgrade Jersey from 2.36 to 2.40. \r\n2. Jersey 2.38 start to use [Junit5 instead of Junit4](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/pull/5123). \r\n3. Spark core module uses `org.glassfish.jersey.test-framework.providers:jersey-test-framework-provider-simple:2.40:test`, which cascades and introduces the dependencies of Junit5.\r\n\r\nSo this pr manual exclude `Junit5` dependencies from `org.glassfish.jersey.test-framework.providers:jersey-test-framework-provider-simple:2.40:test` to make Java tests of core module can be tested using Maven.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pr leaves a TODO to remove this exclusion after Spark  migrates to Junit5 for Java testing:\r\n\r\n- [SPARK-44170](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44170): Migrating Junit4 to Junit5\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake Java tests of core module can be tested using Maven after SPARK-44316. This issue only affects Maven, not SBT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Git Hub Action\r\n- Manual test:\r\n\r\nrun `mvn clean install -pl core -am -Dtest.exclude.tags=org.apache.spark.tags.ExtendedLevelDBTest`\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\nThe core module is not running any Java

(https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/blob/4.8.0/src/main/java/scala_maven/ScalaMojoSupport.java#L629-L648) since this argument is later it took precedence over the value we hardcoded in maven and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes in scala 2.13.11 where `-target` is deprecated and therefore the scala-maven-plugin uses the `-release` argument instead. The first second failure about not being able to accessing `sun._` packages which is expected behvaior when using `-release 8` see: https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12643  but if one sets `--release 11` when using Java 11 access to `sun._` compile just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: That builds using scala 2.13 and java 11 or later without setting `java.version` to the appropriate value will still fail.\r\n\r\nNote2: The java 8 builds still succeeds as the `rt.jar`  is pased on the `-bootclasspath` when using java8.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFixes the maven build when using scala 2.13 and Java 11 or later. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExising CI builds and manual builds locally.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-11T15:07:47Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T06:46:21Z","closed_at":"2023-09-15T06:46:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1703f02a8656c9d8716eab94d71acae0bff2486","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5b9d4f923a22a7a7d25dab0d051995ed0e8b79b","head":{"label":"eejbyfeldt:fix-build-mvn-using-2.13-and-java11+","ref":"fix-build-mvn-using-2.13-and-java11+","sha":"d5b9d4f923a22a7a7d25dab0d051995ed0e8b79b","user":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373800628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM4MDA2Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"eejbyfeldt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41495. This PR contains several changes to make the tests working:\r\n\r\n- Always uses `JobArtifactSet.getCurrentJobArtifactState` to get the current UUID in the current thread.\r\n- Specify the current state (from `JobArtifactSet.getCurrentJobArtifactState`) when add the artifacts (so we can get the state in `SparkContext`).\r\n- Creates a dedicated directory in Driver side too. We provide Spark Connect Server as a service. It creates a session dedicated directory, and put the added files there in the server.\r\n  - Notice that we do not support `SparkFiles.getRootDirectory` in Spark Connect so this should be fine. This dedicated directory will also be used to execute Python process within Driver side (for dependency management, e.g., foreachBatch in Structured Streaming with Spark Connect).\r\n- Get the current UUID in the Driver side for Python UDF execution. Previously, we tired to get it from executor side which results in `None`.\r\n- Rename `sessionUUID` (or similar) to `jobArtifactUUID`. In Core code context, it's a job artifact state.\r\n- Fix Spark Connect Python client local debug mode (e.g., `local` or `local-cluster`) to send jars when `local-cluster` mode is specified. If not, it throws an exception that `SparkConnectPlugin` cannot be found.\r\n- Refactor and fix the tests to verify archive, file and pyfiles in both `local` and `local-cluster` modes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make session-based artifact management working.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this feature has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests added.","created_at":"2023-07-11T12:24:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:00Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T23:49:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8130e738ac0babf654f7d00b64a7f72569db5990","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41942/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41942/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41942/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db52b94cadaa16763413ee9ba9e030cfb1e09eb3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-44348","ref":"SPARK-44348","sha":"db52b94cadaa16763413ee9ba9e030cfb1e09eb3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for schema pruning in delta-based MERGE operations. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to improve the performance of certain row-level operations by skipping columns that are not required to materialize changes.\r\n\r\nConsider an example.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreateAndInitTable(\"pk INT NOT NULL, salary INT, country STRING, dep STRING\")\r\n\r\nsql(\r\n  s\"\"\"MERGE INTO table t\r\n     |USING source s\r\n     |ON t.pk = s.pk\r\n     |WHEN MATCHED AND t.salary = 200 THEN\r\n     | UPDATE SET *\r\n     |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to compute the new state of updated records we only need `pk` and `salary` columns from the target table. Hence, we can skip reading `country` and `dep` as values for those columns are coming from the source relation.\r\n\r\nThis logic does not apply to group-based MERGE operations as those have to copy over records and need values for all columns of the target table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-11T00:20:07Z","updated_at":"2023-07-11T18:37:54Z","closed_at":"2023-07-11T16:08:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4d75874a4f52b9f69efddd69665ecb237d60b3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b910aacad54a0a07105b835841f1627a390b59cf","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-44360","ref":"spark-44360","sha":"b910aacad54a0a07105b835841f1627a390b59cf","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements and exposes the PySpark util function `assertSchemaEqual` to test for DataFrame schema equality. It uses the Python built-in difflib library to display differences between schemas.\r\n\r\nSPIP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OkyBn3JbEHkkQgSQ45Lq82esXjr9rm2Vj7Ih_4zycRc/edit#heading=h.f5f0u2riv07v\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `assertSchemaEqual` function compares schema equality, simplifying the testing process for PySpark users. It adds functionality to ignore the nullability flag for schemas and nested types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR exposes a user-facing PySpark util function `assertSchemaEqual`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_utils.py` and `python/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/test_utils.py`\r\n\r\nSample schema inequality error message:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 10 07 22

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to resolve `WITH` on top of `INSERT INTO` via the regular code path similar to non-commands. In this way, `InsertIntoStatement` is excluded from commands in the rule `CTESubstitution`, and `UnresolvedWith` is moved into `InsertIntoStatement` on top of its `query`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance. Right now the CTE resolution code path is diverged: query with commands go into CTE inline code path where non-command queries go into CTEDef code path. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41495 that skips a couple of flaky tests. In addition, this PR fixes a typo together.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the tests green. In order to reenable the tests, it needs other fixes together that might refactor the whole test cases which takes a while. I will followup and fix them in SPARK-44348\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the feature is not released to end users yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests skipped for now.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-10T04:25:18Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:01Z","closed_at":"2023-07-10T06:01:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6df1c1368dfe8a37d6a99487052477f0addb3aeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ed8ea943cdb536a51813058542c818f9852beee","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-44290-followup","ref":"SPARK-44290-followup","sha":"2ed8ea943cdb536a51813058542c818f9852beee","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

migration is enabled, there're lots of error message like `Asked to update map output for unknown shuffle` .\r\n\r\nAs shuffle clean and unregister is done by `ContextCleaner` in an async way, when target block manager received the shuffle block from decommissioned block manager, then update shuffle location to map output tracker, but at that time, shuffle might have been unregistered. This should not consider as error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo correct a bug introduced in SPARK-37829 where a Scala Option can become null instead of None in typed operations (e.g. Dataset, Aggregator).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we use Option we expect to get back Some(...) or None, but never null.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes it restores the behavior where no nulls show up for Option[_]\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test for Aggregator where the output without this PR has a null where it shouldn't.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a minor issue that the view schema mismatch error message may have an extra space between view name and `AS SELECT`. It also takes the chance to simplify the view test a little bit, to always use `tableIdentifier` to produce the view name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile building the Protobuf descriptor from FileDescriptorSet, this PR uses bundled Java descriptor for 'google/protobuf/any.proto'. This works around a bug in Protobuf's JsonFormat while parsing Any fields initialized with `Any.getDefaultInstance()`.\r\n\r\nAn existing test for Any fields is updated to test this case. Without the fix, the test passes with Java classes, but fails with FileDescriptorSet bytes. The latter is the common use case. \r\n\r\nThe bug in JsonFormat is related to how it checks for Any values at runtime that were originally initialized with `Any.getDefaultInstance()`. Specifically the conditional [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/51f79d4415338cfe068a39d7ce466870df223245/java/util/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf/util/JsonFormat.java#L860)  in JsonFormat.java fails since it tries to compare with actual default instance in Java from Java descriptor. If we build the same descriptor separately, JsonFormat does not recognize it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, input that includes fields initialized to `Any.getDefaultInstance` can not be parsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test is updated to test this case.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProposes a slight modification to the docs for SQL function `array_position()`, to clarify the return value and that function's behavior when no match is found.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the docs at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#array_position leave too much room for confusion.\r\n\r\n> *array_position(array, element) - Returns the (1-based) index of the first element of the array as long.*\r\n> Examples:\r\n> ```\r\n> SELECT array_position(array(3, 2, 1), 1);\r\n>  3\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nBecause the return value also happens to be a return value in the example array, and because the doc says \"first element\" instead of \"first matching element\", I think it'd be easy to misunderstand this function as doing something like \"given `array_position(a, i)`, return `arr[i]`\".\r\n\r\nThe code comment on this function is very clear, but I think the user-facing docs would benefit from similar clarification:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/05bc73a83921a9e606609a12750932f95bd5b3f8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L2134-L2141\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes modifying the doc to remove such confusion, by:\r\n\r\n* providing an example array and search values which are unlikely to be confused with indices\r\n* modifying the example such that it shows the behavior when `array_position(a, v)` is called on an array `a` containing multiple instances of `v`\r\n* adding an example showing the behavior of this function when no match is found\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, minor user-facing documentation change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI did not test this patch at all, just followed the patterns I saw elsewhere in the same file for documentation strings.\r\n\r\nI did check that this was the only place this text came from, like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit grep 'index of the first element of the array as long'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes for Reviewers\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis makes the AbstractParser use SqlApiConf instead of SQLConf, and it moves the appropriate configurations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are moving (datatype) parsing into the sql/api package. This does not use SQLConf, but uses SqlApiConf instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend SparkSession to allow custom interceptors (grpc's ClientInterceptor)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis can be used for different purposes, such as customized authentication mechanisms\r\n\r\nThis is similar to Python which allows custom channel builders (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40993)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSparkSession allows custom interceptors. The proposed usage is\r\n\r\n```\r\nval interceptor = new ClientInterceptor {....}\r\nval session = SparkSession.builder().interceptor(interceptor).create() \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr same with more than one interceptor\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr fixes using UDFs on value classes when it serialized as in underlying type. Previously it would only work if one either defined a UDF taking the underlying type and/or for cases where the schema derived does not \"unbox\" the value to its underlying type. \r\n\r\nBefore this change the following code:\r\n```\r\nfinal case class ValueClass(a: Int) extends AnyVal\r\nfinal case class Wrapper(v: ValueClass)\r\n\r\nval f = udf((a: ValueClass) => a.a > 0)\r\n\r\nspark.createDataset(Seq(Wrapper(ValueClass(1)))).filter(f(col(\"v\"))).show()\r\n```\r\nwould fails with\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.types.IntegerType$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a new java checkstyle rule \r\n\r\n```\r\n<module name=\"RegexpSinglelineJava\">\r\n  <property name=\"format\" value=\"@Test\\(expected\"/>\r\n  <property name=\"message\" value=\"Please use the `assertThrows` method to test for exceptions.\" />\r\n</module>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto prohibit the use of @Test(expected = ExpectedException.class)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefer to https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Exception-testing\r\n\r\nJunit 4 does not recommend `Specifying the expected annotation via the @Test annotation.`, \r\n\r\n```\r\nThe expected parameter should be used with care. The above test will pass if any code in the method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException. Using the method you also cannot test the value of the message in the exception, or the state of a domain object after the exception has been thrown.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the previous approaches are recommended.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `Using assertThrows Method` is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual checked:\r\n\r\nrun `dev/lint-java` without change `RemoteBlockPushResolverSuite.java`\r\n\r\n```\r\nCheckstyle checks failed at following occurrences:\r\n[ERROR] src/test/java/org/apache/spark/network/shuffle/RemoteBlockPushResolverSuite.java:[284] (regexp) RegexpSinglelineJava: Please use the `assertThrows` method to test for exceptions.\r\n[ERROR]

This included generation expression validation. This validation currently erroneously fails when there are char or varchar columns anywhere in the table schema since the checkAnalysis fails here https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/GeneratedColumn.scala#L123.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces any char/varchar columns in the schema with a string before analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis should not fail.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE default.example (\r\n    name VARCHAR(64),\r\n    tstamp TIMESTAMP,\r\n    tstamp_date DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(tstamp as DATE))\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdds a unit test.","created_at":"2023-07-05T23:12:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T02:27:14Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T02:26:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a87fbd4bbb2302f92537188dd2b846aa12e44bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/920a91c481e7d9f0691e00eb83a21529fd41c56d","head":{"label":"allisonport-db:validateGeneratedColumns-charvarchar","ref":"validateGeneratedColumns-charvarchar","sha":"920a91c481e7d9f0691e00eb83a21529fd41c56d","user":{"login":"allisonport-db","id":89107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTA3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515435375,"node_id":"R_kgDOHrjrbw","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonport-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonport-db","id":89107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTA3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR supports arrow-optimized Python user-defined table functions (UDTFs). Similar to Python UDFs, arrow optimization for Python UDTFs can be enabled/disabled using:\r\n\r\n1. The `spark.sql.execution.pythonUDTF.arrow.enabled` config (default: True)\r\n2. The `useArrow` parameter of the `udtf` function (default: None)\r\n\r\nNote that **arrow optimization is enabled by default** for Python UDTFs. If the user does not have the necessary pandas or pyarrow dependencies, it will fall back to using regular Python UDTF.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Python UDTFs more performant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR allows users to create arrow-optimized Python UDTFs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2023-07-05T22:52:20Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T17:57:21Z","closed_at":"2023-07-13T05:26:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a40802ce71e0597030c4d0c66b133f02785b0958","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3aa15bad65a293f50e7c3d6cc323039747cccc0e","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-43964-arrow-udtf","ref":"spark-43964-arrow-udtf","sha":"3aa15bad65a293f50e7c3d6cc323039747cccc0e","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the `SPARK_CONNECT_USER_AGENT` environment variable as a fallback for the prepended user agent string if one did not set the user agent in `ChannelBuilder`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently one has to specify a custom user agent string in `ChannelBuilder`. It would be useful to be able to set this string with an environment variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n In the current code, to check if a join is a shuffle join or not, left and right sides are interchanged. This is not correct as for few joins the left and right side are considered to check if  a join is shuffle or not. This PR has moved the check to a place where left and right side are know. Then the value is used for verification at other places. \r\n\r\nThe method checking if the join is a shuffle or not is not taking join type into consideration. Added a extra parameter in isProbablyShuffleJoin method and used it to determine if the join is a shuffle join or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe left side of left outer join is not broadcasted even if its small enough to avoid incorrect result. One of the ways to optimize this is using bloom filter. This helps in reducing the size of right size. But bloom filter is not created if the filter creation side is small enough to be broadcasted. This is causing small left outer join relation are neither broadcasted nor able to use bloom filter. So we need to add a check in bloom filter to allow bloom filter for left outer, right outer and semi joins even if the size is small enough to be broadcasted. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nModify the directory deletion in `SparkConnectArtifactManager#cleanUpResources` to target the session-specific artifact directory instead of the root artifact directory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when `SparkConnectArtifactManager#cleanUpResources` is called, it would lead to the deletion of **all** artifacts instead of session-specific ones. This breaks resource isolation among sessions when the bug is triggered.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test in `ArtifactManagerSuite` that verifies that the correct directory is deleted as well as the existence of the root directory.","created_at":"2023-07-04T13:43:44Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T07:38:41Z","closed_at":"2023-07-05T03:06:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d357a02495f9c44f16af896925d33be717130e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8fbcee4505adf3cb5744f166291889b9614c8d13","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-44300","ref":"SPARK-44300","sha":"8fbcee4505adf3cb5744f166291889b9614c8d13","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMaking `RDD.getOutputDeterministicLevel` a public API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe concept of RDDs having is already \"exposed\" in that developer API `RDD.getOutputDeterministicLevel` and in SPARK-34592 RDDs deterministic level are shown in the Web UI.\r\n\r\nHaving this be part of the public API is useful for user and library authors. For example consider some library that uses RDDs internally and want to call for example `zipWithIndex` on a RDD. Since `zipWithIndex` has a precondition that `outputDeterministicLevel == DeterministicLevel.DETERMINATE` it would be very good if such a library author could add asserts and/or only conditionally checkpoint the RDD only paying the overhead when it actually needed.\r\n\r\nThe ticket SPARK-34612 says that we should decide if we should expose outputDeterministicLevel. So if this PR is rejected we should consider closing the ticket with the decision that we should not expose it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it makes  `RDD.getOutputDeterministicLevel` public.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-04T10:46:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-14T00:17:05Z","closed_at":"2023-10-14T00:17:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2731d61141faca611551cd06eebb79c6428280fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9af61db704178b1e98076b3a4fff0b9fddec5cce","head":{"label":"eejbyfeldt:SPARK-34612","ref":"SPARK-34612","sha":"9af61db704178b1e98076b3a4fff0b9fddec5cce","user":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373800628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM4MDA2Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"eejbyfeldt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt/spark","description":"Apache
