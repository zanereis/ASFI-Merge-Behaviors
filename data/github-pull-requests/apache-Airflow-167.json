We've realized that the DruidHook used there is [calling druid overlord every 1 second](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/apache/druid/hooks/druid.py#L104-L128) to get status, because it's using default timeout and it's not possible to set it in the operator itself. In our case ingestion takes around 1 hour, so there is no need to check it that often.\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43473995/144471590-996ca185-3a24-421b-85a4-c57a2ca71142.png)\r\n\r\nWe would would like to add timeout parameter to DruidOperator, so we can set how often DruidHook will be calling overlord to get status.\r\n\r\nExample log after change with timeout 180 seconds:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43473995/144472561-b01107d6-7e0c-4e46-b251-e14eb7bf4811.png)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I've missed something.\r\nThank

a DagRun exceeds its `dagrun_timeout` value a few things happen:\r\n - The run is marked as `failed`\r\n - All unfinished tasks are marked as `skipped` (which causes running tasks to be SIGTERM'd)\r\n - A line is logged in the scheduler logs: `INFO: Run $RUN_NUMBER of $DAG_ID has timed-out`\r\n \r\nThis has caused some confusion amongst users as its hard to tell why running tasks were killed without either:\r\n1) Cross-referencing the `dagrun_timeout` value with the execution time\r\n2) Reading the scheduler logs. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds additional messaging into the task logs when it can be inferred that the task was killed due to a DagRun timeout. \r\n\r\nI'm not super happy with this implementation (as it kind of duplicates the timeout logic to infer that a timeout occurred) and would really appreciate some advice on other ways we can improve the clarity around timeouts. \r\n\r\nI'll add some tests for this once I get some feedback on the initial approach.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T01:00:16Z","updated_at":"2022-02-04T20:08:55Z","closed_at":"2021-12-10T21:22:06Z","merged_at":"2021-12-10T21:22:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"fab778eab4c1c66bf8274a8016e853d8311ca399","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

run a lot of dags/tasks (~600 dags with 50 tasks in each) on kubernetes, and the scheduler tends to crash from so many. Adoption is common.\r\nOn adoption, it would patch the pod, but when a specific field would get re-written (I'm not sure which, sorry) that would cause a new pod to be created instead.\r\nThis new pod would then change the status of the task instance, causing the pod to die with SIGTERM, and the task to fail.\r\n\r\nThis patch asks it to only update the label, which has removed the symptom (from 300+ daily failures to 0).\r\nI only needed to do this for `adopt_launched_task`, but also did it for `adopt_finished_task` for consistency.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

adds a new view under each dag that provides\r\nquick access to a table of the most recent dag runs\r\nand their status.\r\n\r\nThe previous views providing similar functionality are\r\n- Tree, which can be a bit hard to navigate for new users and\r\n  if you are looking for one specific dagrun where you care\r\n  more about input arguments or results, rather than execution date.\r\n- DAG Runs under the browse menu, which can be very hard to reach\r\n  and requires user to fill in the dag id as search parameter\r\n  each time to not get too many results.\r\n\r\nThis new view is intended to provide a middle ground, containing all\r\nthe details (and more) of that under DAG Runs, but with equally easy\r\naccess as the tree view.\r\n\r\nIncluded is also a proof of concept for allow DAG authors to provide\r\ncustom formatters to add arbitary columns in this new dagrun table.\r\nAs example, you can provide links to downlaod results or logs, and\r\ncan visualize the most important values of their specific dag, such\r\nas the input config. For dags which are more depending on user input,\r\nrather than the logical date and time tables.\r\nThe idea is that adding new columns should be equally easy as writing\r\na DAG and not require rebuilding webserver or providers.\r\n**This final step is not finalized and is left open for suggestions\r\non how to best proceed, given AIP-38 is in progress this might\r\nnot be worth pursuing further.**\r\n\r\n**How it looks:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89977373/144283492-e4791b7a-7c1e-4592-8c68-1f07e64695f8.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T17:37:08Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T07:32:37Z","closed_at":"2022-01-20T07:32:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f15b685bb50643eaafeb4922e1d9095695d89f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

described in detail in #19860, there was a race condition in\r\nstarting and terminating DagProcessorAgent that caused us a lot\r\nof headeaches with flaky test_scheduler_job failures on our CI\r\nand after long investigation, it turned out to be a race\r\ncondition. Not very likely, but possible to happen in production.\r\n\r\nThe race condition involved starting DagProcessorAgent via\r\nmultiprocessing, where the first action of the agent was changing\r\nthe process GID to be the same as PID. If the DagProcessorAgent\r\nwas terminated quickly (on a busy system) before the process\r\ncould change the GID, the `reap_process_group` that was supposed\r\nto kill the whole group, was failing and the DagProcessorAgent\r\nremained running.\r\n\r\nThis problem revealed a wrong behaviour of Airflow in some edge\r\nconditions when 'spawn' mode was used for starting the DAG processor\r\nDetails are described in #19934, but this problem will have to be\r\nsolved differently (avoiding ORM reinitialization during DAG\r\nprocessor starting).\r\n\r\nThis change also moves the tests for `spawn` method out from\r\ntest_scheduler_job.py (it was a remnant of old Airlfow and it\r\ndid not really test what it was supposed to test). Instead tests\r\nwere added for different spawn modes and killing the processor\r\nagent in both spawn and \"default\" mode.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The full talk was here: https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2021/usability-improvements-debugging-inspection-tooling/.\r\nBut the one this is tackling is the dagrun history view, which helps illustrate the dagruns that were run for this dag, with the additional information about each run and formatted in a more readable way. This is similar to the dagrun tab in the webserver but is simpler for the user as it is already at the dag view. We also show duration to identify outliers. We allow them to also link to all the records if they like which links to the dagrun tab. It also has a final column to show the type of run prefix it is, i.e. scheduled, backfill, manual, other.\r\n\r\nWe had feedback asking for this to be shared so this is our first part in adding new views. We are welcome to any feedback and how everyone thinks this view can be more useful/helpful for all. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1027\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-30 at 1 49 50 AM\"

Overview\r\nThis version of watchtower contains patches (submitted by myself and Andrey the maintainer) that fixes #15279 where empty log lines would crash Watchtower.\r\n\r\n## Testing \r\nI wrote a dag with the following benchmarks:\r\n- Log a single line from a task\r\n- Log an empty line\r\n- Log 1000 lines\r\n- Log 10,000 lines\r\n- Log 100,000 lines\r\n\r\nI detected no noticeable regression in task run time, and as expected the new watchtower version does not crash when logging an empty line.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The logic, as Andrey wrote it, ignores empty log lines and emits a warning message (see snippet below). The warning messages could be a nuisance if you're logging empty lines frequently, and it is possible to remove them, but I think it's a also a good indicator to the user that their remote logs will look different than they expect due to the empty messages being filtered. Let me know what you folks think.\r\nExample output from my empty line benchmark task:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n[2021-11-30, 19:22:45 UTC] Running command: ['bash', '-c', \"echo ''\"]\r\n[2021-11-30, 19:22:45 UTC] Output:\r\n[2021-11-30, 19:22:45 UTC] /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/watchtower/__init__.py:349 WatchtowerWarning: Received empty message. Empty messages cannot be sent to CloudWatch Logs\r\n[2021-11-30, 19:22:45 UTC] Command exited with return code 0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

used to be that the backfill job deadlocked when a task had\r\n\"depends_on_past\" set. This was because it depended on past,\r\nnon-existing and not succesful task.\r\n\r\nYou needed to set `ignore_first_depends_on_past' set in order to\r\navoid the deadlock. This test was quarantined but I think\r\nthe behaviour has changed.\r\n\r\nIt looks like currently Airflow behaves differently: when checking\r\ndependencies, it actually retrieves the previous dag-run and\r\nif there is none available it does not deadlock no matter if\r\ndepends_on_past is set. That makes much more sense and likely\r\nwas fixed during the recent changes involved in timetable\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the tests to show that backfill will behave\r\nproperly, regardless from `ignore_first_depends_on_past`.\r\n\r\nFixes: #14755\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

scheduler job tests were pretty flaky and some of them were\r\nquarantined already (especially the query count). This PR improves\r\nthe stability in the following ways:\r\n\r\n* clean the database between tests for TestSchedulerJob to avoid\r\n  side effects\r\n* forces UTC timezone in tests where date missed timezone specs\r\n* updates number of queries expected in the query count tests\r\n* stabilizes the sequence of retrieval of tasks in case tests\r\n  depended on it\r\n* adds more stack trace levels (5) to compare where extra\r\n  methods were called.\r\n* increase number of scheduler runs where it was needed\r\n* add session.flush() where it was missing\r\n* add requirement to have serialized dags ready when needed\r\n\r\nHopefully:\r\n\r\n* Fixes: #18777\r\n* Fixes: #17291\r\n* Fixes: #17224\r\n* Fixes: #15255\r\n* Fixes: #15085\r\n\r\n(Based on #20054 to test if all green).\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

TLDR\r\n\r\nAdd support for serializing connections as JSON instead of the Airflow Connection URI format.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    export AIRFLOW_CONN_MY_PROD_DATABASE='{\r\n        \"conn_type\": \"my-conn-type\",\r\n        \"login\": \"my-login\",\r\n        \"password\": \"my-password\",\r\n        \"host\": \"my-host\",\r\n        \"port\": 1234,\r\n        \"schema\": \"my-schema\",\r\n        \"extra\": {\r\n            \"param1\": \"val1\",\r\n            \"param2\": \"val2\"\r\n        }\r\n    }'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously in general we could only store connections in the Airflow URI format.  With this change we can serialize as json.  \r\n\r\nThe Airflow URI format can be very tricky to work with and although we have for some time had a convenience method Connection.get_uri, using json is just simpler.\r\n\r\nWe already have some secrets backends supporting json values, and we could continue to add support on a piecemeal basis, but i figure we should just make it first class citizen and standardize the logic.\r\n\r\n# Approach\r\n\r\n## rename `get_conn_uri` --> `get_conn_value`\r\n\r\nMore accurately, we add `get_conn_value` and deprecate `get_conn_uri`.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this rename is only to make the name appropriately generic -- not to initiate deprecation of airflow's URI format.\r\n\r\nI replace `get_conn_uri` with the more generically-named `get_conn_value`,  with the assumption that the value may not be the URI representation but instead a JSON representation.\r\n\r\nSecrets backends which have implemented `get_conn_uri` will continue to work, but the method is deprecated and should be removed at the next opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe methods `get_conn_value` and `get_conn_uri` will be called in order so that the new method is tried first and if not implemented we fall back to  the old method. \r\n\r\n## add method `deserialize_connection`\r\n\r\nThis method handles construction of the Connection object from the string value returned from `get_conn_value`. This provides a single location for parsing a string as a Connection.\r\n\r\n## added option `conn-json` to cli connection add

task is executed using \"StandardTaskRunner._start_by_exec()\" (when fork is not available) it's using old DONOT_MODIFY_HANDLERS config variable loaded during settings.py load and not the one from externally supplied --cfg-path param\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nWhen \"tasks run\" command is executed it then internally re-executed as below command using external process (non fork when it's not available).\r\n```[2021-11-16 15:28:16,818] {base_task_runner.py:144} INFO - Running: ['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', 'test_logging_dag', 'test_task', 'test_run', '--job-id', '102', '--raw', '--subdir', 'DAGS_FOLDER', '--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py', '--error-file', '/tmp/tmphjtaj5gi']```\r\n\r\nHere `'--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py'` is a copy of active config settings of parent process. When command is executed settings.py file is loaded as one of the first things but external config (/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py) is loaded later within task_command.py->def task_run.\r\nAnd when it does load it does not re-initialize this setting.\r\nThis causes DONOT_MODIFY_HANDLERS to be initialized to a default value rather than one that is defined in the /tmp/tmpfv4cj9py\r\nThe PR fixes it by moving initialization into settings.py/configure_vars function where it can be called when needed.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI think this issue is not limited to this variable but all other similar GLOBAL variables that is initialized during settings.py load.\r\nBut I think we need to check each of them separately before making similar changes.\r\n\r\n#19755 linked to this which I closed in favor this.\r\n---\r\n**^

support for dynamically generating DAGs from configuration in JSON or YAML format. The JSON/YAML contains the mandatory `builder` parameter with the path to the python \"template\" file which would parse the configuration to emit a DAG.\r\n\r\nThis improves scalability of dynamic DAG loading methods, as Airflow now considers each config file in separate process (earlier if a single python script was reading multiple json/yaml files, they were all being processed in a single process, limiting scalability). If the json/yaml fails to parse, it's registered as an import error. It's the json/yaml content which shows up in webserver's Code view.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you are running multiple schedulers on PostgreSQL, it is likely that sooner or later you will have one scheduler fail the race to enter the critical section (which is fine, and expected).\r\n\r\nHowever this can end up spamming the DB logs with errors like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]: 2021-11-26 14:08:48.672 GMT [709953] ERROR:  could not obtain lock on row in relation \"slot_pool\"\r\nNov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]: 2021-11-26 14:08:48.672 GMT [709953] STATEMENT:  SELECT slot_pool.pool AS slot_pool_pool, slot_pool.slots AS slot_pool_slots\r\nNov 26 14:08:48 sinope postgres[709953]:         FROM slot_pool FOR UPDATE NOWAIT\r\nNov 26 14:08:49 sinope postgres[709954]: 2021-11-26 14:08:49.730 GMT [709954] ERROR:  could not

slot_pool_slots\r\nNov 26 14:08:49 sinope postgres[709954]:         FROM slot_pool FOR UPDATE NOWAIT\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are really unlucky that can end up happening over and over and over again.\r\n\r\nSo to avoid this error, for PostgreSQL only, we first try to acquire an \"advisory lock\" (advisory because it's up to the application to respect it), and if we cannot raise an error _like_ would have happened from the `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`.\r\n\r\n(We still obtain the exclusive log on the pool rows so that the rows are locked.)\r\n\r\nThis PR is split in to two commits, the second

PR #19736 and feature request #18999 \r\n\r\nThe PR intends to refactor `DatabricksHook` and related classes as a preparation step before introducing Deferrable Operator for Databricks.\r\n\r\nMain points:\r\n- Use `int` type for `run_id` and `job_id`. Databricks docs specifies it as integer. Also, actual responses from Databricks API return integer, not string.\r\n- Fix filling AAD headers.\r\n- Move AAD token validation into a separate function, covered with tests.\r\n- Change initialisation of `RunState` - make it explicit that `run_state` might be None. Currently there's a tiny comment in the code telling that result_state might be None in case a job is still running.","created_at":"2021-11-26T08:25:48Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T16:24:56Z","closed_at":"2021-12-05T21:56:18Z","merged_at":"2021-12-05T21:56:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"728e94a47e0048829ce67096235d34019be9fac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/19835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/19835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/19835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9d08a127014d9f245163dbc5b9eb5f8138f48acd","head":{"label":"eskarimov:18999-refactor-databrickshook","ref":"18999-refactor-databrickshook","sha":"9d08a127014d9f245163dbc5b9eb5f8138f48acd","user":{"login":"eskarimov","id":13220923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIwOTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13220923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/eskarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":390028555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwMjg1NTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"eskarimov/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eskarimov","id":13220923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIwOTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13220923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/eskarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eskarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eskarimov/airflow","description":"Apache

using a sensor in reschedule mode, the poke_interval is used to calculate a new date to run the task. However, user errors may easily cause the entire scheduler to crash if that new date goes over MySQL's TIMESTAMP limit, which causes the database to return NULL later.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds some very rudimentary checks to avoid these user errors as soon as possible. The checks are far from bullet-proof; to be actually resillient, Airflow should really migrate away from using the TIMESTAMP field altogether, which is a big but important topic on its own and needs to be handled in the next ten years.\r\n\r\nClose

Issue\r\nI went to use the `install_aws.sh` script inside breeze (see [docs here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/BREEZE.rst#additional-tools)) which are supposed to be on the PATH within breeze to easily execute them:\r\n> Each script is also available in $PATH, so just type install_<TAB> to get a list of tools.\r\n\r\nThough when I attempted to use the script it was not found on the PATH. The PATH should be what's exported [here in Dockerfile.ci](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/adc6bbfee397ce7f2cc3206ef8e77bf0f74715d6/Dockerfile.ci#L374). \r\nThe below screenshot shows what was actually present in Breeze (as well as a snippet of the `/etc/profile` script which is overwriting it), this is not the exported value from Dockerfile.ci:\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-11-23 19-48-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/143171726-1ef1f69a-a858-4032-8f84-6f8242ba7b05.png)\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nIn the start_tmux script, export the PATH (which is correctly set within the container when executing the start_tmux script) into the ~/.profile file (so that it is shell agnostic).\r\nWith this change the correct path is present in Breeze:\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-11-23 20-06-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/143173177-83b64d3c-51b4-452c-be9b-aa126bb893b4.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

was a side effect caused by th TestStandardRunner \r\ntest that caused broken logging configuration,\r\nwhich in turn created OutOfMemory condition for our Public\r\nGitHubRunners.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the test overrode the configuration of\r\nlogging with some simple test configuration, but never restored\r\nthe default configuration, which resulted in `airflow.processor`\r\nlogger that was created before contain empty handlers. Since\r\nthe `airflow.processor` logger has \"propagate\" set to False,\r\nempty handlers normally cause a lastResort handler call, which\r\nby default redirects everything to Stderr and this is what\r\nhappened in DagFile Processor tests. However, DagFileProcessor\r\nuses `stderr_redirect` which replaces `sys.stderr` with provided\r\nstream. In this case however the stream set (StreamLogWriter)\r\nredirected the output to \"airflow.processor\" logger - which in\r\nturn (as last resort) redirected everything to sys.stderr which\r\nin turn redirected everything to \"airflow.processor\" logger etc.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in:\r\n\r\n* OOM condition in Public GitHub Runners\r\n* DagFileProcessor failing with exceeded recursion depth when\r\n  there was enough memory to get there.\r\n\r\nThe condition was triggered by two preceding tests:\r\n\r\n1) First test_plugins_manger.py initialized logging for\r\n   `airflow.processor` and stored it in logging manager\r\n2) The TestStandardTaskRunner test applied simpler configuration\r\n   but the way configure() works - it did not remove the\r\n   \"airflow.processor\" logger, but it REMOVED all handlers\r\n   registered for it - and never restored the default configuration\r\n3) The DagFileProcessor logs caused infinite recursion\r\n\r\nThe fix is two-fold:\r\n\r\n* the TestStandardTaskRunner restores default config after test\r\n* the DagFileProcessor sets default config before starting\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis pull request represents a significant increment in the functionality of the PSRP provider.\r\n\r\n## Hook\r\n\r\nA method `invoke_cmdlet` has been added in addition to the existing `invoke_powershell` to `PsrpHook` – but it also provides a more general `invoke` method which works as a context manager such that you can build up your own command pipelines.\r\n```python\r\nwith PsrpHook(...) as hook, hook.invoke() as ps:\r\n    # Use `ps` to build up commands; upon exiting the context,\r\n    # the commands will be sent to the host for execution.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe hook now logs records arriving in all six streams (see `pypsrp.powershell.PSDataStreams`).\r\n\r\n- DEBUG\r\n- ERROR\r\n- INFORMATION\r\n- PROGRESS\r\n- VERBOSE\r\n- WARNING\r\n\r\n## Operator\r\n\r\nA \"cmdlet\" parameter has also been added to `PsrpOperator` for convenience.\r\n\r\nThis is useful in particular when the session type is \"RestrictedRemoteServer\" (i.e., \"NoLanguage\" mode) where typically only a constrained et of cmdlets (e.g., \"Restart-Server\") are configured as _visible_.\r\n\r\n### JSON result\r\n\r\nWhen using XComs (and for PowerShell commands only, i.e., `cmdlet` and `script`), the operator always pipes the result via `ConvertTo-Json` in order to return a result that is compatible with XCom serialization.\r\n\r\nIf not using XComs, the output is just logged like any of the other streams.\r\n\r\n### Template support for secure string\r\n\r\nA template filter `securestring` has been added to the operator to conveniently tag a secret value for serialization into the `System.SecureString` PowerShell native type. Note that this works only with the native environment – see [rendering fields as native Python objects](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/operators.html#rendering-fields-as-native-python-objects).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\n{{ conn.test_conn.password |

Updating `default_args` values to more relevant examples.\r\n- Replace `DummyOperator` with another operator to make some other `default_args` updates relevant and applicable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add
