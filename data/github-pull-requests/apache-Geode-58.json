Augment various collections to use generics\r\n* Inline some iterator loops that were trivially \"foreach\" loops\r\n* remove unused code\r\n* Inline some redundant local variables\r\n* make some

previous synchronization looked quite wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn particular, there are some (I'm pretty sure more correct) functional changes to  `ThrottlingMemLinkedQueueWithDMStats`.

test appears like it was trying to test what happens if a put\r\nhappens when data store creation is at a particular point.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it failed to do so correctly because it just spun off the\r\ndata store creation in separate threads and then did the put. The wait\r\ncriterion used was also completely wrong, so the test would always wait\r\nfor 1 minute.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were some race conditions caused by passing the same\r\narray list to multiple async task.\r\n\r\nChanged the code to wait until the data stores are at the given point in\r\nregion creation and then do the put.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache
