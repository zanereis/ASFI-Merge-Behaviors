- Processor Details no longer appears when clicking 'View Processor Details'\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nfixes bug NIFI-7032 Processor Details no longer appears when clicking 'View Processor Details',\r\n\r\n**Root cause:** nf-canvas-utils module will not be loaded in case of NiFi Summary Window (summary window is loaded inside an iframe), so nfCanvasUtil  is undefined and it causes an exception when trying to get the parameter context which is called which creating the processor info dialog, it was induced while fixing, NIFI-6630\r\n\r\n**Fix done:** added a check when the nfCanvasUtil is undefined, in such case, the context is not required the porpoerties are non-editable.(the parmeter context is being used in the property table to check whether the user can edit the data etc. as in case of summary dialog, the table is just for display of processor data).\r\n\r\n**Tested in:** Chrome 79, Safari 13\r\n\r\n**Before Fix:** \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"Before Fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16460179/72541787-2505ff80-38a9-11ea-84c4-49ea298f5849.png\">\r\n\r\n**After

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR is 2 commits, the first is a patch from the original contributor (see NIFI-6902 for more details), the second is mine adding a unit test for regression purposes. Running with my commit and not his causes the test to fail, running with both causes the test to pass.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-14T15:52:46Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T17:58:52Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T17:58:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff77bef512e81e0b7c18893d41d40856ee2e0612","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/d68c8c6b284f060bde76eb3919c65bbf4978c3b3","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-6902","ref":"NIFI-6902","sha":"d68c8c6b284f060bde76eb3919c65bbf4978c3b3","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

activeQueue, swapQueue. activeQueue is intended to be pulled from for processing. swapQueue is intended to hold FlowFiles that are waiting to be swapped out. SinWe want to ensure that we first swap in any data that has already been swapped out before processing the swap queue, in order to ensure that we process the data in the correct order. This fix ddresses an issue where data was being swapped out by writing the lowest priority data to a swap file, then adding the highest priority data to activeQueue and the 'middle' priority data back to swapQueue. As a result, when polling from the queue we got highest priority data, followed by lowest priority data, followed by middle priority data. This is addressed by avoiding putting anything back on swapQueue when we swap out. Instead, write data to the swap file, then push everything else to activeQueue. This way, any new data that comes in will still go to the swapQueue, as it should, but all data that didn't get written to the Swap file will be processed before the low priority data in the swap file.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nEnables xz-lzma2 compression format of the CompressContent processor to use the compression level property in addition to the gzip format which already could use compression level; adds functionality requested in NIFI-6964.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ X ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ X ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ X ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes? There were no specific tests for the xz-lzma2 format. Apologies I didn't backfill initial tests for this format and then test the compression level. In fact, there were no tests at all for gzip compression level either.\r\n- [ X ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ n/a ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ n/a ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ n/a ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ n/a ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ n/a ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

NIFI-4834 enhancement for durable non shared consumers only. \r\n\r\nUpdated also AbstractJMSProcessor class to be public.

of publishing all attributes as headers to the JMS broker, I've added an option to REGEX the headers the user wants to send.\r\n\r\nI've also added an option to allow illegal characters in header

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nFor the new connection pool properties, I added `evaluateAttributeExpressions()` as their doc suggests they support Variable Registry EL. Also when those properties were added, the DBCP version was upgraded to 2.6.0 so I updated the Javadoc for those properties as well\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

ProvenanceReporter\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds two new methods to `ProvenanceReporter` enabling a way to capture how FlowFiles were `fetch()`ed or `receive()`ed in provenance events. Also updated provenance event persistence to include the new `FlowFileAcquisitionMethod`. See [NIFI-6851](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6851) for additional rationale behind this change.\r\n\r\nI have not updated any anything to use these new methods other than unit tests. This PR is just to contribute the feature. Processors can be updated either in this PR based on feedback or separately in another JIRA.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-12T19:21:08Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a979400c82a3df16c52585edb76a0efebc4ebd22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2915399856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE1Mzk5ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/7ae9906d5761a3314bac75267de3f4d4b0d37698","head":{"label":"m-hogue:NIFI-6851","ref":"NIFI-6851","sha":"7ae9906d5761a3314bac75267de3f4d4b0d37698","user":{"login":"m-hogue","id":7054178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7054178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue","html_url":"https://github.com/m-hogue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"be34767c8a0670bce564f6aac4490e3250817675","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27911088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkxMTA4OA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"apache/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi","description":"Apache

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdded functionality to read and write from samba shares with GetSmbFile and PutSmbFile processors. The advantage is to not have to manage cifs mounts on the server/nodes. Also the processors supports windows style share locks on the files during read and write.\r\nIt's using [SMBJ client library](https://github.com/hierynomus/smbj) for the samba connection.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nFor RecordReader implementations that don't close the underlying input stream when nextRecord() returns no records, JoltTransformRecord fails the flowfile instead of sending the input flowfile to the \"original\" relationship. Unit tests didn't catch it because MockProcessSession wasn't keeping track of the open stream counts.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

to `trigger()` may be called concurrently from different threads,\r\nhowever the PutKudu processor is storing the `kuduSession`\r\nin a class level field. This can result in the logging issue reported in\r\nNIFI-6895 and likely other unusual anomolies including performace\r\nissues depending on the processor configuration.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the `operationType` was also stored in a class level field\r\nand could be set concurrently resulting in the incorrect operation type\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by moving both kuduSession and operationType\r\nto be local. Additionaly some minor code cleanup was included.\r\n\r\nAn integration test, ITPutKudu, was added and used to manual verify the\r\nlogging issue existed and is fixed by this patch.

on non-primary nodes.\r\nPrevent non-primary nodes to connect Twitter API when running in primary node only mode. This Fixes bug NIFI-6905:\r\n\r\nI updated the GetTwitter processor `onScheduled()` method to only create a `clientBuilder` without connecting it to the Twitter API.\r\nConnection is now initialized by the `onTrigger()` method when it needs it (in primary node only mode `onTrigger()` never run on non primary nodes....).\r\nAdded `onPrimaryNodeChange()` to close connection on `PRIMARY_NODE_REVOKED` events.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
