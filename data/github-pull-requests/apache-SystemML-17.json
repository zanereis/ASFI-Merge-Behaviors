PR adds conditions to the fusion plan enumerator to stop costing a plan when its partially computed cost exceeds the cost of the best plan found so far (an upper bound).\r\n\r\nThe Statistics class reports the number of partially costed plans separately from the number of fully costed plans. I attempted to count the number of Hops costed per plan in order to measure the effectiveness of stopping costing early at a more fine-grained level, but this count was inaccurate for some reason.  On StratStats, 2301 out of 3742 plans can be stopped costed early.\r\n\r\nThere are a few changes to nearby code, such as computing `2^n` as `1L << n`, rather than using `Math.pow`.  I marked a segment in the outer product fusion template as having a bug; the bug appears during the StratStats experiment. I added a try-catch loop in order to not fail the program when this occurs; instead, the compiler simply does not generate a fused spoof operator. This bug should be fixed in a future patch.","created_at":"2017-08-09T07:08:22Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T10:46:55Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T04:14:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7aeb182b1732663ca37caf942b56a2af83eef072","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/9ede26f23206f316505dc09faf32a9f2ed566120","head":{"label":"dhutchis:codegen_search_prune","ref":"codegen_search_prune","sha":"9ede26f23206f316505dc09faf32a9f2ed566120","user":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93704957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MzcwNDk1Nw==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dhutchis/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis/systemml","description":"Mirror

the `rangeReIndex` operation, it needs to read the whole input matrix into memory first and then do the subsetting in the memory. It is not efficient because it needs to read a lot of unnecessary data, and even will be out of memory if the size of input matrix exceeds the available memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes the data pipeline of matrix subsetting. It reads the keys in the Hadoop sequence file, and identify the keys overlapped with the input range index. Then the values specified by the identified keys will be

anticipation of near-future algorithmic improvements to the\r\npreprocessing to improve model training, this simplifies and cleans up\r\nthe preprocessing code as follows.\r\n\r\n- Previously, we were processing all slides into one large saved\r\nDataFrame, and then splitting that DataFrame into train and validation\r\nDataFrames.  This commit simplifies this by splitting the slide numbers\r\ninto train and validation sets, and then processing those slides\r\nseparately.  This effectively skips the creation of the large DataFrame,\r\nand removes the need to split that large DataFrame into train/val ones,\r\nwhich should provide a large performance benefit.  The DataFrame `union`\r\nmethod can be used to combine two DataFrames row-wise.\r\n- Previously, we maintained a list of \"broken\" slides that were manually\r\nremoved.  This commit removes that manual list, and instead adds a\r\ntry/except filtering step to automatically remove problematic slides.\r\n- This commit moves ad-hoc sampling code into a new `sample` function.\r\n- This commit moves code to add row indices to a DataFrame into a new\r\n`add_row_indices` function.\r\n\r\nThe benefit is that near-future algorithmic improvements to the\r\npreprocessing code will be much easier to

PR is a proposal for providing fine-grained statistics using the existing Statistics infrastructure and minimizing any additional overhead. If we don't agree on this approach, I am OK with closing the PR without merging :)\r\n\r\nThough SystemML provides explain and statistics tooling functionality to understand the execution plan and the performance, most users (even committers) are not able to explain why SystemML's performance is so good or bad. This is likely because SystemML's optimizer performs sophisticated dataflow analysis, cost optimization as well as static and dynamic rewrites. New features/backends such as code generation, automatic fusion, compression and GPU backend adds additional level of complexity to the optimizer. This PR is a small step in the direction of explaining SystemML's behavior. \r\n\r\nInstead of examining statistics output (like the one given below) and then trying to correlate with the explain plan, this PR provides instruction-level statistics with the corresponding DML snippet (file beginLine:beginCol-endLine-endCol).\r\n\r\nCurrent output:\r\n```bash\r\nHeavy hitter instructions:\r\n  #  Instruction               Time(s)   Count\r\n  1  forward                   134.884     516\r\n  2  leftIndex                 102.870   66650\r\n  3  write                      77.799     172\r\n  4  gpu_conv2d_backward_data   26.467   66564\r\n  5  gpu_conv2d_bias_add        17.225    2322\r\n  6  rangeReIndex               12.987  133214\r\n  7  rand                       10.785     517\r\n  8  gpu_bias_add               10.615     516\r\n  9  rmvar                       4.405  953146\r\n 10  rshape                      3.849   38528\r\n 11  gpu_sel+                    2.871    2752\r\n 12  gpu_append                  1.206     516\r\n 13  gpu_ba+*                    1.192     172\r\n 14  gpu_r'                      0.563     344\r\n 15  gpu_uarmax                  0.544      86\r\n 16  gpu_uark+                   0.461      86\r\n 17  gpu_uak+                    0.363       1\r\n 18  createvar                   0.339  314140\r\n 19  *                           0.189  666846\r\n 20  gpu_/                       0.152      86\r\n 21  gpu_-                       0.150      86\r\n 22  gpu_maxpooling              0.087     516\r\n 23  -

The script we ran had three left indexing operations: two in the file `conv2d_transpose_depthwise.dml` and one in the main script at line 270. However the information `  2  leftIndex                 102.870   66650` is not sufficient to help the DML script writer understand where exactly is the bottleneck. Separating the different instances of `leftIndex` instructions provides much better picture:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  2  leftIndex [270:4-270:17]                                                            37.469      86\r\n  4  leftIndex [106:4-106:42]                                                            29.836   28552\r\n 10  leftIndex [./nn/layers/conv2d_transpose_depthwise.dml 106:4-106:42]                 11.250   38012\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, there are additional TODO items which may have to be addressed in a separate PR. For example: certain line numbers correspond to the parent expression `4  leftIndex [106:4-106:42]`  corresponds to the variable initialized in line 106 of the main script, but the leftIndex operation was actually performed in the file `conv2d_transpose_depthwise.dml`.\r\n\r\n@bertholdreinwald @mboehm7 @dusenberrymw @nakul02 @deroneriksson Please review this PR and provide your suggestions and

PR adjusts the element-wise multiply chain rewrite rule. \r\nIt now groups inputs into (1) unknowns/frames/objects, (2) non-vector matrices, (3) row vectors, and (4) column vectors and scalars. Each group is multiplied among all its inputs, in order of increasing nnz. Then, we multiply across groups as `(((other)*matrices)*row_vectors)*col_vectors_and_scalars`. The resulting order looks like the following:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    (((unknown * object * frame) * ([least-nnz-matrix * matrix] * most-nnz-matrix))\r\n     * ([least-nnz-row-vector * row-vector] * most-nnz-row-vector))\r\n    * ([[scalars * least-nnz-col-vector] * col-vector] * most-nnz-col-vector)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAdds a test that tests all these different kinds of inputs.\r\n\r\nMoves the rewrite to dynamic rewrites.

functions compute the top k values (i.e. probabilities) and associated indices (i.e. classes) from the input matrix X. A typical use case is that in which X is the output of a softmax layer, and values and indices will contain rows with the top k probabilities and class indices. For the 2D case, top_k will operate on the channels dimension. A typical use case here is that in which X is the output of a softmax2d layer, so each channel contains a set of normalized class probabilities, and values and indices will contain the top k probabilities and indices along the channel axis. The scenario will be common in an image segmentation

adds (1) a new 2D depthwise convolution layer, and (2) a new 2D depthwise transpose convolution layer.\r\n\r\nA depthwise convolution (1) applies a different set of M filters to each input channel separately, thus expanding each input channel to M output channels, and (2) concatenates the results into a single volume with C*M output channels.  This is in contrast to a regular 2D convolution, in which all of the filters would be applied to all of the input channels at once.\r\n\r\nA depthwise transpose convolution (1) applies a different filter to each unique group of M input channels separately, thus condensing each group of M input channels to 1 output channel, and (2) concatenates the results into a single volume with C/M output channels.  This is in contrast to a regular 2D transpose convolution, in which all of the filters would be applied to all of the input channels at once.\r\n\r\nThese layers use for loop implementations for now, and I'll work on possible vectorized updates at a later date.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new layers, this also adds the associated unit and gradient

the transpose conv2d layer (`nn/layers/conv2d_tranpose.dml`)\r\nhas a bug in which the filters tensor `W` has an incorrect shape, and\r\nthe `conv2d_backward_data` op has an incorrect input shape argument.\r\nThis results in an exception when the number of input channels `C` is\r\nnot equal to the number of filters `F` (i.e. number of output channels).\r\nSince the transpose conv2d op is the gradient of the conv2d op, the\r\nfilter tensor needs to have the shape `(C, F, Hf, Wf)` for `F` filters,\r\nrather than `(F, C, Hf, Wf)`, in order to map from an input with `C`\r\nchannels to an output with `F` channels during the input data gradient\r\nfunction (`conv2d_backward_data`) that is used in the forward pass.\r\nAdditionally, the `input_shape` argument for `conv2d_backward_data`\r\nneeds to be `(N, F, Hout, Wout)`, rather than `(N, C, Hout, Wout)` in\r\norder to map from an input with `C` channels to an output with `F`\r\nchannels.  Our previous test cases did not catch this issue because\r\nthe tests used `C = F = 1`.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes these issues, and improves the robustness of the\r\nassociated

PR adds the rule `RewriteEMult`. It operates on sub-dags of Hops composed of BinaryOps that do multiplication, re-ordering the multiplicands (by the commutative and associative properties of multiplication) and collapsing identical multiplicands into element-wise powers. For example, it simplifies `A * B * A` to `(A^2) * B`.  Here is a more general example: Hop tree\r\n\r\n    ((((A * v) * c) * v) * c) * B\r\n\r\nis rewritten to\r\n\r\n    A * (B * ((v^2) * (c^2)))\r\n\r\nNotice that the matrices were grouped together (they are actually ordered so that the sparsest matrix appears first, which later sparsity-driving fusion can take advantage of), then the vectors are grouped together (more precisely, row vectors then column vectors), and then the scalars. Whenever a multiplicand appears more than once, it is consolidated into a power, to the number of times it appears.\r\n\r\nThis rule interacts with a few other rules. I modified them as follows.\r\n\r\n1. In `AggUnaryOp`, I added conditions to the `TernaryAggregate` detection method to act on expressions of the form `sum(A^2 * B)`. Since I was knee-deep in this method anyway, I also added a condition to detect `sum(A^3)`. These changes were necessary since prior to RewriteEMult, they would have been `sum(A * B * A)` or `sum(A * A * A)`, both of which are converted into TernaryAggregates which is a faster, fused operator (i.e., it is faster because it produces fewer intermediates).\r\n\r\n2. In the dynamic algebraic rewrite `simplifyDotProductSum`, I added a condition to make it play nicely with the `TernaryAggregate` rewrite described above.\r\n\r\nThe following new tests verify these rewrites:\r\n\r\n1. `RewriteEMultChainTest` tests rewriting the expression `2*X*3*Y*4*X`. The constants in the expression group together and are constant folded into 24.  The resulting expression is `Y*(X^2)*24`.\r\n2. `ABATernaryAggregateTest` ensures that TernaryAggregate plays nicely with RewriteEMult.","created_at":"2017-06-10T08:50:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T18:48:14Z","closed_at":"2017-06-19T04:49:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"078557e01cd5680fe17120b38b5306afe01a49fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/04f692dfcb25a032044dabb7064241073f959300","head":{"label":"dhutchis:rewrite-emult","ref":"rewrite-emult","sha":"04f692dfcb25a032044dabb7064241073f959300","user":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93704957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MzcwNDk1Nw==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dhutchis/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis/systemml","description":"Mirror

Adds a `checkArity()` method to Hop and implements it in every Hop.\r\n* Matrix data type Hops must have a Double value type\r\n* Visit flag must be properly reset via `Hop.resetVisitStatus()`. Uses an external Set to track which Hops have been seen and compares this to the visit flag of each Hop.\r\n* Add related Javadoc \r\n\r\nThere is a CHECK flag in `ProgramRewriter` that enables the validator after applying rewrites. It is currently set to true.\r\n\r\nThere are several tests that fail with this validator in place.

This PR only extends Caffe2DML to support image segmentation problem.\r\n- I will add support for depthwise deconvolution (when number of filters = number of groups) in a a separate PR.\r\n- I have also added couple of bugfixes for loading of Caffe model using Caffe2DML (for the case when Caffe is not installed).\r\n- This PR also fixes few bugs related to loading a caffemodel.\r\n- Additionally, I have added a summary() method to Caffe2DML to print network:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>>
