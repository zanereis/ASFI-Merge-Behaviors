In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

think that LocaclTaskJob should control which tasks are to be executed.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5945\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe inbuilt Operator links were not working when using DAG Serialization (which was 1 of the limitations of DAG Serialization). The work-around previously was adding those OperatorLinks using Airflow Plugin.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it so we inbuilt links work out of the box. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6153\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe would want to allow fields like `sql` (in BigQueryOperator) and `qubole_conn_id` (in QuboleOperator) to be serialized and saved in DB. This is needed for OperatorLinks to work for both the respective operators as they rely on this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6155\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe GCP Bigtable Hook, a wrapper about the GCP Client functionality for Bigtable, has only a few methods currently, all addressing administrative tasks. I would like to add the ability to read and write Bigtable data in rows using the Hook.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/gcp/hooks/test_bigtable/test_create_rowkey_regex_filter\r\ntests/gcp/hooks/test_bigtable/test_delete_row\r\ntests/gcp/hooks/test_bigtable/test_check_and_mutate_row\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T19:32:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T15:57:39Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T15:57:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fdd5a3a1383e2613b138d99218e54b488b4b071","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6144\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`[2019-12-02 14:33:56,384] {dag_processing.py:760} ERROR - Cannot use more than 1 thread when using sqlite.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T07:54:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T12:17:33Z","closed_at":"2019-12-02T12:16:45Z","merged_at":"2019-12-02T12:16:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"7616d7eaffc4fe87be188e8051290718ae962af4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fa9734e1f523e53656c0b466149df80fb3482542","head":{"label":"seii-saintway:improve/AIRFLOW-6144","ref":"improve/AIRFLOW-6144","sha":"fa9734e1f523e53656c0b466149df80fb3482542","user":{"login":"seii-saintway","id":3340161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3340161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway","html_url":"https://github.com/seii-saintway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225311737,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjUzMTE3Mzc=","name":"airflow","full_name":"seii-saintway/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seii-saintway","id":3340161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDAxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3340161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway","html_url":"https://github.com/seii-saintway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seii-saintway/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seii-saintway/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) i\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5834\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Adding an option to skip serve logs process starting with workers. With the advent of K8s, serving logs from workers isn't useful anymore. Also, fundamentally it feels wrong to serve two entirely diff processes from one command. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T05:37:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T19:33:01Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T19:33:01Z","merged_at":"2019-12-03T19:33:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"fac365323891fe33a4e8c5d1f29d11985f65f85b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/42e45f961d3ad0a5ac985cc689a113ddb3ec05a7","head":{"label":"msumit:AIRFLOW_5834","ref":"AIRFLOW_5834","sha":"42e45f961d3ad0a5ac985cc689a113ddb3ec05a7","user":{"login":"msumit","id":2018407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2018407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit","html_url":"https://github.com/msumit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48538838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODUzODgzOA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"msumit/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"msumit","id":2018407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2018407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit","html_url":"https://github.com/msumit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/msumit/airflow","description":"Airflow

We\r\nwould like to have it exactly identical when run locally and in CI so in case\r\nof static checks we should rather use\r\nAIRFLOW_MOUNT_HOST_VOLUMES_FOR_STATIC_CHECKS=\"true\" for all checks but the\r\nChecklicence one - same as used locally.\r\n\r\nThis way running:\r\n\r\npre-commit run pylint --all-files\r\n\r\nShould always give the same results locally and in Travis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6135\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6128\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhile adding type annotations, it was apparent that the code for\r\nplugin manager and webserver initialisation was rather convoluted\r\nand complex. This change fixes it as follow up after untangling\r\ncyclic dependnencies.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect - it turned out that the test plugin view\r\nin airflow RBAC implementation was not working since 1.10.1 - it threw \"render\r\nis not an attribute\" error - this has been fixed in this commit\r\nas well. The Plugins/TestView now works as expected. See\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/53701030/airflow-plugins-rbac-enabled-blueprint-not-working?answertab=active#tab-top\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-30T19:14:01Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T07:29:54Z","closed_at":"2020-02-17T07:29:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6a24813aa74aebb48ee351bc2283b1948022ae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-6072 and AIRFLOW-6075\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdditional capabilities on aws_hook with documentation to match. These capabilities allow for more complex scenarios such as:\r\n\r\n1. Specifying boto3.client config, used eg when connecting behind http_proxy\r\n1. Additional logging to help understand how credentials are found and used\r\n1. kwargs for assume_role provide more flexibility\r\n1. Allow to specify boto3.session parameters such as 'profile' which thereby supports ~/.aws/config files\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI manually tested the new capabilities against my AWS account\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\nModernised the aws hook documentation and linked it up to the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6091\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMy PR addresses issue with results buffer and reading flags not being cleaned in some cases what ends up in returning no data or even data from previous job in case of executing many queries with one cursor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nMy PR does not add any functionality to test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6083) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6083\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nMy PR adds ability to provide Lambda client with custom configuration.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: \r\nIt does not need testing as the functionality that was already implemented in function get_client_type was defaulting config param to None, which I also do in case no config is provided to AwsLambdaHook constructor. If config is provided, then the only thing I do is pass it to the client creation function, which already has everything else implemented.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all errors reported by new version of mypy and updates CI to run mypy 0.740.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDescription on JIRA\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNot a major change\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\nThere are code comments for users who need to go down the proxy rabbit hole. However the whole AWS Hook should be documented better as the code is quite confusing and I often resorted to adding logging/debug statements just to figure out what was going on. I'll create a new JIRA for that.","created_at":"2019-11-26T13:23:56Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T06:56:48Z","closed_at":"2019-11-29T06:56:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b69da962e03eb1a4908ee453cb9c8fae2ffedd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6063\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe issue https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3123 has been fixed. So we can remove this dependency from our setup.py.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6057\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAllow passing Jinja templated arguments to the python_callable of the PythonSensor (just like in PythonOperator) by adding op_args and op_kwargs to the template_fields of the PythonSensor.\r\nAlso fix the test_python_callable_keyword_arguments_are_templatized test of the PythonOperator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - test_python_callable_arguments_are_templatized for op_args,\r\n  - test_python_callable_keyword_arguments_are_templatized for op_kwargs\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

] Added a couple of unit tests around the new function\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5548\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5550\r\n\r\nI have added five new endpoints to the experimental REST API to allow for clients to pull information about dags and the tasks that compose them. This is useful for remote monitoring and execution. These endpoints include:\r\n\r\nGET - DAG Info\r\nGET - Dags in dagbag\r\nGET - Tasks in a DAG\r\nGET - Upstream Tasks\r\nGET - Downstream Tasks\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe REST API is experimental, howeverI will write unit tests if necessary\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\nAll methods contains docstrings\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-23T23:11:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T05:26:33Z","closed_at":"2020-04-18T05:26:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d247f26e97384b16ca34811b8057295bbe5e0bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @bolkedebruin

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6051\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-23T15:10:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T18:14:59Z","closed_at":"2019-11-26T18:14:58Z","merged_at":"2019-11-26T18:14:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8d47718183865500a6926615934d858db8ffd0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

airflow.task handlers don't have StreamHandler\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6049\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen the log handler of `airflow.task` is already a subclass of `StreamHandler`, the `propagate = True` will double log.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested in the CLI run.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n@KevinYang21 @saguziel

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6045\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, if someone runs `python setup.py compile_assets sdist` and if they don't have npm install or if for some reason the script called by compile_assets function fail, the function does nothing as it uses `subprocess.call`. We should use `subprocess.check_call` to fix it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6044\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe `execute` method is before `_init_`. The order doesn't matter but for the sake of consistency across Airflow codebase, it would be ideal to standardize this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAlready covered\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6043\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nOriginal issue:\r\n```\r\nt1 = DummyOperator(task_id=\"t1\", dag=DAG)\r\nt2 = DummyOperator(task_id=\"t2\", dag=DAG)\r\nt3 = DummyOperator(task_id=\"t3\", dag=DAG)\r\nt1 >> t2\r\nt2 >> t3\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1607\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-22 at 17 04 00\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3982146/69432179-41266e00-0d4a-11ea-8caa-3f8c793b4f19.png\">\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6042\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Adding our company to _\"Who uses Apache Airflow?\"_\r\n\r\nHello everyone, is it possible that our company appears on **_\"Who uses Apache Airflow?\"_** section? We are a small team working in [Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/), a big spanish electric distributor and part of [Enel](https://www.enel.com/). I wrote some pipelines to automate the ETLs processes we use with Hadoop / Spark, so I believe it would be great for our team.\r\n\r\n[Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/) [@drexpp]\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n___\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Airflow Jira Issue [AIRFLOW-6033](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6033) and references them in the PR title.\r\n \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\n\r\nAirflow UI will crash in the browser returning \"Oops\" message and the Traceback of the crashing error.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by modifying a task_id with a capital/small letter, I will point out some examples that will cause airflow to crash:\r\n\r\ntask_id = \"DUMMY_TASK\" to task_id = \"dUMMY_TASK\"\r\ntask_id = \"Dummy_Task\" to task_id = \"dummy_Task\" or \"Dummy_task\",...\r\ntask_id = \"Dummy_task\" to task_id = \"Dummy_tASk\"\r\n___\r\n#### File causing the problem:  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/www/views.py (lines 1643 - 1654)\r\n```\r\nfor task in dag.tasks:\r\n    y[task.task_id] = []\r\n    x[task.task_id] = []\r\n\r\n    for ti in task.get_task_instances(start_date=min_date, end_date=base_date):\r\n\r\n        ts = ti.execution_date\r\n        if dag.schedule_interval and dag.following_schedule(ts):\r\n            ts = dag.following_schedule(ts)\r\n        if ti.end_date:\r\n            dttm = wwwutils.epoch(ti.execution_date)\r\n            secs = (ti.end_date - ts).total_seconds()\r\n            x[ti.task_id].append(dttm)\r\n            y[ti.task_id].append(secs)\r\n```\r\n___\r\n\r\nWe can see in first two lines inside the first for loop, how the dictionary x and y is being filled with tasks_id attributes which comes from the actual DAG.\r\n\r\nThe problem actually comes in the second for loop when you get the task instances from a DAG, I am not sure about this next part and I wish someone to clarify my question about this.\r\n\r\nI think that the task instances (ti) received from get_task_instances() function comes from the information stored into the database, that is the reason of crash when you access to \"Landing Times\" page, is that the x and y where filled with the actual name of the task_id in the DAG and the task_instances' task_id has different name stored causing this problem access to the dictionary.\r\n\r\nOne of my main questions is how having a different task name (such as changing from \"run\" to \"Run\") the function get_task_instances() keeps returning past task instances with different name, such asking instances of Run but returns task instances (ti) with task_id \"run\"?\r\n\r\n### Error screeshot\r\n\r\nHow to replicate: \r\n\r\n  - Launch airflow webserver -p 8080\r\n  - Go to the Airflow-UI\r\n  - Create an example DAG with a task_id name up to your choice in small letters (ex. \"run\")\r\n  - Launch the DAG and wait its execution to finish\r\n  - Modify the task_id inside the DAG with the first letter to capital letter (ex. \"Run\")\r\n  - Refresh the DAG\r\n  - Go to \"Landing Times\" inside the DAG menu in the UI\r\n  - You will get an \"oops\" message with the Traceback.\r\n\r\n![error_img](https://i.imgur.com/0tXRDuH.png)\r\n____\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n  - I didn't know exactly how to unit test this, if you have any advice I will do a test for it. Other than that, I did test checking that the behaviour was as expected:\r\n    \r\n    - [X] Create DAG and access to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Modify a task from the created DAG to a completly new name and access to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Modifying a task with capital/lower letters and accessing to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Switch to the original name and access to Landing Times\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

Adding our company to _\"Who uses Apache Airflow?\"_\r\n\r\nHello everyone, is it possible that our company appears on **_\"Who uses Apache Airflow?\"_** section? We are a small team working in [Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/), a big spanish electric distributor and part of [Enel](https://www.enel.com/). I wrote some pipelines to automate the ETLs processes we use with Hadoop / Spark, so I believe it would be great for our team.\r\n\r\n[Endesa](https://www.endesa.com/) [@drexpp]\r\n___\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Airflow Jira Issue [AIRFLOW-6033](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6033) and references them in the PR title.\r\n \r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI targeted to v1-10-stable since I think is what @ashb recommended to me in my last PR.\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\n\r\nAirflow UI will crash in the browser returning \"Oops\" message and the Traceback of the crashing error.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by modifying a task_id with a capital/small letter, I will point out some examples that will cause airflow to crash:\r\n\r\ntask_id = \"DUMMY_TASK\" to task_id = \"dUMMY_TASK\"\r\ntask_id = \"Dummy_Task\" to task_id = \"dummy_Task\" or \"Dummy_task\",...\r\ntask_id = \"Dummy_task\" to task_id = \"Dummy_tASk\"\r\n___\r\n#### File causing the problem:  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/www/views.py (lines 1643 - 1654)\r\n```\r\nfor task in dag.tasks:\r\n    y[task.task_id] = []\r\n    x[task.task_id] = []\r\n\r\n    for ti in task.get_task_instances(start_date=min_date, end_date=base_date):\r\n\r\n        ts = ti.execution_date\r\n        if dag.schedule_interval and dag.following_schedule(ts):\r\n            ts = dag.following_schedule(ts)\r\n        if ti.end_date:\r\n            dttm = wwwutils.epoch(ti.execution_date)\r\n            secs = (ti.end_date - ts).total_seconds()\r\n            x[ti.task_id].append(dttm)\r\n            y[ti.task_id].append(secs)\r\n```\r\n___\r\n\r\nWe can see in first two lines inside the first for loop, how the dictionary x and y is being filled with tasks_id attributes which comes from the actual DAG.\r\n\r\nThe problem actually comes in the second for loop when you get the task instances from a DAG, I am not sure about this next part and I wish someone to clarify my question about this.\r\n\r\nI think that the task instances (ti) received from get_task_instances() function comes from the information stored into the database, that is the reason of crash when you access to \"Landing Times\" page, is that the x and y where filled with the actual name of the task_id in the DAG and the task_instances' task_id has different name stored causing this problem access to the dictionary.\r\n\r\nOne of my main questions is how having a different task name (such as changing from \"run\" to \"Run\") the function get_task_instances() keeps returning past task instances with different name, such asking instances of Run but returns task instances (ti) with task_id \"run\"?\r\n\r\n### Error screeshot\r\n\r\nHow to replicate: \r\n\r\n  - Launch airflow webserver -p 8080\r\n  - Go to the Airflow-UI\r\n  - Create an example DAG with a task_id name up to your choice in small letters (ex. \"run\")\r\n  - Launch the DAG and wait its execution to finish\r\n  - Modify the task_id inside the DAG with the first letter to capital letter (ex. \"Run\")\r\n  - Refresh the DAG\r\n  - Go to \"Landing Times\" inside the DAG menu in the UI\r\n  - You will get an \"oops\" message with the Traceback.\r\n\r\n![error_img](https://i.imgur.com/0tXRDuH.png)\r\n____\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n  - I didn't know exactly how to unit test this, if you have any advice I will do a test for it. Other than that, I did test checking that the behaviour was as expected:\r\n    \r\n    - [X] Create DAG and access to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Modify a task from the created DAG to a completly new name and access to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Modifying a task with capital/lower letters and accessing to Landing Times\r\n    - [X] Switch to the original name and access to Landing Times\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-22T10:01:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T11:57:42Z","closed_at":"2019-11-22T11:57:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdcb56d40dec519055ae523f0c86e6ec8478b37c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/db730048f757d44b2ebb1fb9d623165d88767556","head":{"label":"drexpp:v1-10-stable","ref":"v1-10-stable","sha":"db730048f757d44b2ebb1fb9d623165d88767556","user":{"login":"drexpp","id":13250238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjUwMjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13250238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp","html_url":"https://github.com/drexpp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drexpp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b40140939304fc4d867bf4a2eefddb6e08cff846","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2279\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere's an apparent need for a way to clear tasks across DAGs when there are dependencies set up by `ExternalTaskSensor`. This PR adds an `ExternalTaskMarker` to indicate such a need. When `ExternalTaskMarker` is used, the \"Clear\" action by the user will look for the external tasks recursively and clear them. There's no need to change the UI because the \"Recursive\" option in the Clear form fits this nicely. \r\n\r\nThis is primarily addressing AIRFLOW-2279. However, there are various other users in the community using `ExternalTaskSensor` to set up cross-DAG dependencies. Many of them asked for this feature. \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2279\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1414\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1446\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4005\r\nhttps://www.mikulskibartosz.name/using-sensors-in-airflow/\r\nhttps://forum.astronomer.io/t/dependencies-across-dags/332\r\nhttps://geoffruddock.com/how-to-use-external-task-sensor-in-airflow/\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38022323/how-to-set-dependencies-between-dags-in-airflow\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1825\r\n\r\nThere was an inactive PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2444 trying to implement this feature. However it was abandoned. And I feel my approach is simpler and more flexible. And it does not need UI changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests added to test_external_task_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5931\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] Rather than running a fresh python interpreter which then has to re-load\n  all of Airflow and its dependencies we should use os.fork when it is\n  available/suitable which should speed up task running, espeically for\n  short lived tasks.\n\n  I've profiled this and it took the task duration (as measured by the\n  `duration` column in the TI table) from an average of 14.063s down to\n  just 0.932s!\n\n  I _could_ make this change deeper and bypass the `CLIFactory`/go directly to `_run_raw_task`, but this makes the change the minimum needed to work.\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] No unit tests added. Hopefully existing tests good enough. Manual testing shows this working\n\nOther tests I need to perform:\n\n- [x] Check if `os._exit` is right (this doesn't run atexit callbacks) - so I need to check if logging in the subprocess istidied up properly.\n- [x] Test if this leaves \"dangling\"/broken DB connections.\n- [x] Check remote log uploading\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release","created_at":"2019-11-21T15:12:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T12:44:47Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T10:47:38Z","merged_at":"2019-12-10T10:47:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f69aa14a021a6160ecdb75678fd40cf00a404525","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/115139507326548b6bcc8be799b2d0029690ca55","head":{"label":"ashb:task-performance-only-exec-when-needed","ref":"task-performance-only-exec-when-needed","sha":"115139507326548b6bcc8be799b2d0029690ca55","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache
