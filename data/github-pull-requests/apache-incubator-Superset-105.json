SUMMARY\r\n- Adds tests to `URLShortLinkButton` component\r\n- Moves `URLShortLinkButton` component to its own folder\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to [augment our custom render function](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests#connected-components) with the Redux provider. Currently, our custom render function injects the `ThemeProvider`. If we set the option `useRedux` to `true`, the redux `Provider` will be added automatically with all the reducers in `spec/helpers/reducerIndex` and an empty state. We can override these with `initialState` and `reducers` options. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n`render(<Component />);`  // only theme provider\r\n`render(<Component />, { useRedux: true });`  // theme and redux provider\r\n`render(<Component />, { useRedux: true, reducers: { messageToasts }, initialState: { ... });`  // theme and redux provider with overridden reducers and state.\r\n\r\n@rusackas @junlincc \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute all tests to verify `URLShortLinkButton` component and custom render function\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-24T14:40:47Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:44:24Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T18:59:36Z","merged_at":"2021-02-25T18:59:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"72721845e1e0c23956df51fd849539a61cb3e4ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2746846622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ2ODQ2NjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/test:component","name":"test:component","color":"93DEE0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nSince the query mutator can change the query in arbitrary ways, I think we should always recalculate the extra cache keys when it exists.\r\n\r\nThat said, i'm not familiar with this code at all, so would really appreciate other eyes on this\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI: ensure the sql query mutator runs on cached charts\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\n- Moving the `OmniContainer.tsx` file  to `OmniContainer` folder\r\n- Split into different files\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNo change in behavior, all tests must pass.\r\n\r\nNotes: In the type of `omnibar` there are no props `id` or `className`. However, in the original javascript implementation, the prop `className` were being used. I checked that in execution both attributes were send to `<input />`.\r\nSo to be able to change the file to typescript and implement the tests I split `Ominibar` in another file, with the same interface that was being used in `OminiContainer`.\r\nI marked component `Omnibar` as `@deprecated` and create a test to ensuring that the input will have the id that was sent...\r\nTo work correctly, I had to use the \"// @ts-ignore\" tag before the id attribute.\r\n\r\nI believe that the correct fix for this is a PR in `omnibar` types or find some other lib that does the same and can meet the implementation requirements.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-23T20:17:24Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:44:20Z","closed_at":"2021-02-26T19:21:52Z","merged_at":"2021-02-26T19:21:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f706e6e7a2c9ddbff29ea5fa7c57d5fb556dbb9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hughhhh","id":27827808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODI3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27827808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh","html_url":"https://github.com/hughhhh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329338104,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MzM4MTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XL","name":"size/XL","color":"5C3BBc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2746846622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ2ODQ2NjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/test:component","name":"test:component","color":"93DEE0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nJust a small handful of styles I noticed while touching the `.ResultSetButtons` class in #13254. This just moves a few lines out of LESS and into Emotion styled components using `gridUnit`. I was on the fence about using the `css` prop vs the `styled` approach, but went with the latter since if we're to open a hundred of these PRs, I figured it makes sense to go with the one that's easier to review, by migrating a unique class to a unique styled component. If others prefer the `css` approach, I'll re-jigger this one, and follow that pattern going forward.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Cleaning up tech debt in Welcome recents cards and add proper typing.\r\n- Fixes missing React children key and invalid dates bug (PR #12227 seems to have brought back Bug #12893

Let Recent activity cards use backend humanized relative dates, too.\r\n- Change the copy from \"Last modified\" to \"Last viewed\" for `Viewed` cards because that's what they are.\r\n\r\nAlternative

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently the state of whether we should show the left bar in SQL Lab is **global**, not per tab. Since this is configured separately in each tab menu, it makes sense to track the state individually.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the state of the left bar to the query editor, using the redux store to toggle its display. If the `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` is enabled the visibility is stored on the backend as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n0. `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` set to off.\r\n1. Created a few tabs, changed their visibility, verified that visibility is defined per tabs and persists on page refresh.\r\n2. Turn `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` on, reload SQL Lab, verified that tabs' state was migrated to the backend.\r\n3. Toggle visibility, verified state is persisted in the backend and loaded correctly on page refresh and tab switch.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFollowup from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13246\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13087 made some change to the menu links, trying to standardize routes to always end in an `/`, which should make matching between frontend routes and backend routes easier. When a route is `@expose`d, and ends in a `/`, flask automatically redirects urls that do not end in a `/` to the correct endpoint. This behavior does not happen when the route is `@expose`d without the trailing `/`. It looks like FAB `@expose`s most endpoints to end in a `/`, except for the `/form` route, which has resulted in some 404s for the menu links. This PR addresses the issue by changing the `@expose`d routes to end in a `/`, except for the case of the FAB `form` route, where this is not possible, the trailing `/` is removed from the menu links.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Menu link

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds some features to `/api/v1/chart/data` needed for native filters, namely:\r\n- support for retrieval of the total row count of a query (needed for calculating page count when doing server side pagination; see related PR [here](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/959))\r\n- support for retrieval of time grains\r\n- support for retrieval of datasource columns\r\n- support for retrieving data from multiple datasources in the same request (not needed quite yet, but this adds support for the feature as it will come up later)\r\n\r\nTo avoid adding more clutter to `QueryContext`, the result actions have been moved to a separate module `superset/common/actions.py` to avoid having `query_context.py` grow further in size. In addition, some general refactoring has been done.\r\n\r\nGoing forward I believe we should consier splitting up `/api/v1/chart/data` into multiple endpoints (e.g. `api/v1/chart/data/annotation`, `api/v1/chart/data/query`, `api/v1/chart/data/metadata` etc), or consider moving certain endpoints to GraphQL to make it easier to retrieve nested data in one request.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + added tests. I have also tested this with `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag, and it works fine for all request types.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR only includes tests for the FormLabel component but no storybook. The FormLabel is a React Bootstrap component that we aim to deprecate asap, so the goal of this PR is only to contribute to the stability of the system as it currently stands with no additional investment. \r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the FormLabel component to a dedicated

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe `Button` component had some styles to adjust margins of consecutive sibling buttons. This wasn't working in all cases since some were rendered as different element types (`button` or `a`). This PR adds a (library agnostic) class to the `Button` elements, so that they can be spaced more reliably using an Adjascent Sibling Selector (`+`).\r\n\r\nI also pulled out the `grid-gap` from `.ResultSetButtons` since the above adjustments take care of the spacing.\r\n\r\n~~This also includes a little bycatch of a seemingly unnecessary `React.Fragment`~~\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

SUMMARY\r\nAccess policies might be stored or obtained externally from Superset (e.g. by a sidecar with Open Policy Agent or Apache Ranger). `raise_for_dashboard_access` was located in \"dashboard\" so it could not be overridden by a security manager implementation. This aligns the implementation with other security features.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nThis has the same logic as before so same tests apply.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n- Creation of a `componentDidMount` hook. The reason for this hook is so that there are fewer lint errors and there is no need to put ``// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`` throughout the project\r\n- Updated the ``useEffect(effect, [])`` to use the new hook (remove some lint errors and improve reading)\r\n- Switched FlashProvider to function component and created tests for it (Also simplify the props he receives)\r\n- I separated the creation of the Store from the App file. To facilitate the maintenance and creation of new reducers. And also to facilitate the testing of some components that need to perform dispatches.\r\n\r\nDespite the change in the FlashProvider interface, no change in behavior should occur in the application.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAll tests must pass","created_at":"2021-02-18T18:46:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:43:43Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T16:46:12Z","merged_at":"2021-02-23T16:46:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"6297ad7c8b7e5850863ecd8349bfe6b69cff5b9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2746846622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ2ODQ2NjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/test:component","name":"test:component","color":"93DEE0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new hook `useApiV1Resource`, which I want to put forward as an example of a new state management pattern. This lets a functional component fetch arbitrary api data with just a couple lines of code, with the entire async request lifecycle and component lifecycle taken care of. For now it uses local state, but we can change it to use any other form of storage without changing how the hook is called.\r\n\r\nAs a micro-POC, I've used the hook to refactor some code to lazy load chart owners instead of depending on bootstrap data. This will save quite a few joins in future stages of the Single Page App project.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nUnit tests to be written before merge - seeking feedback on hook design first.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe migration script `b56500de1855_add_uuid_column_to_import_mixin.py` has a try/except block when adding the `uuid` column to tables; if the operation fails the script might succeed depending on the error. Because of this, people who have ran the migration are having problems running Superset because of missing columns.\r\n\r\nI fixed the script by removing the try/except block, and adding a new script that adds the column wherever necessary.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n1. Ran migration, nothing happened as expected (since all my tables have the uuid column)\r\n2. Downgraded to 070c043f2fdb and deleted the `uuid` column from the `dashboards` table\r\n3. Ran migration, and verified that `uuid` was added to `dashboards` and populated.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nFix for issue https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11359, https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9406\r\n\r\nWhen using LDAP authentication with presto/trino, the current behavior is just to modify the URL to replace the username which will result in an unauthorized exception. This PR will fix this by updating the connection argument with the effective user. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nStep 1: Setup database connection to presto without credentials in URL.\r\nStep 2: Provide admin(who can impersonate as any other user in presto) credentials in connection properties via extras  \r\n```\r\n\"engine_params\": {\r\n           \"connect_args\":{\r\n              \"protocol\": \"https\",\r\n              \"username\":\"<admin>\",\r\n              \"password\":\"<admin_password>\"\r\n           }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 3: Enable impersonation for the database connection. \r\nStep 4: Log in with a different user and run the query via SQL lab and you will see the **principal user** as admin and **user** as the logged-in user in presto UI.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nCreates a new REST API endpoint to fetch the CSRF token from.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to deprecate the old API `/superset/csrf_token` in favour of this new endpoint.\r\nBefore making the old endpoint issue a deprecation log message, we need to migrate the front-end client to this new endpoint.\r\n\r\nBy using this new endpoint, it's now easier to use the new API programatically by using JWT tokens to authenticate (only available to Auth DB and Auth LDAP, yet can work with other configurations by creating a username/password on the DB) \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1158\" alt=\"Screenshot

SUMMARY\r\nDue to recent changes in #12782 regarding resetting control values when datasource changes, debounce in TextControl component stopped working properly. This was caused by comparing `props.value` with `state.value` and setting `state.value` to `props.value` if they were not equal. Because of using 0.5s debounce, props and state values were always unequal when user typed a new value. This PR fixes the issue by adding a comparison of props and state datasource and updating value only when datasources are not equal.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13191\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/108376726-8ebab080-7203-11eb-8ef2-f3ef73aab2f3.mov\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13191\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nCC: @villebro @junlincc \r\n@nikolagigic @mayurnewase please help review this PR, thanks!

SUMMARY\r\nGithub Actions that provide the ability to create an ephemeral environment running a PR's latest merge commit via a command executed via PR comment. The Docker build is run in a virtual environment created via [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), using the [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container runtime. This functionality is sponsored by @preset-io.\r\n\r\n- Adds an additional Docker build target (**ci**) which includes additional scripts to initialize and run the container instance\r\n- Builds the Docker **ci** target on `pull_request` events (utilizing the cache from previous `docker build` runs) and saves the build as a [workflow artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts).\r\n- Adds a **Push ephmereral env image** (`workflow_run`) workflow to tag and push the Docker **ci** image to [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).\r\n- Adds an **Ephemeral env workflow** (`issue_comment`) workflow to evaluate PR comments for the `/testenv up` or `/testenv down` commands and deploy ECS services accordingly.\r\n- Adds new secrets to the repo: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. These credentials correspond to an AWS IAM user with appropriate ECS privileges. An Apache INFRA ticket is pending to add these secrets to the repo.\r\n\r\n![Github Actions_ Ephemeral Environments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/296227/108271620-eb479e00-7125-11eb-9bc5-0ec1bd7e6871.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n- When a PR is opened or updated, a Docker **ci** build of the merge commit will be saved and uploaded to ECR.\r\n- Posting a comment on the PR containing `/testenv up` (and nothing else) will trigger the ephemeral environment creation or update. _Note: this functionality is currently restricted to members of the **apache** Github organization._\r\n- When the environment is created, a comment will be posted to the PR with the relevant details:\r\n<img width=\"926\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-17 at 12 34 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/296227/108267592-4080b100-7120-11eb-8de6-35f6e452af49.png\">\r\n\r\n- Note that the environment will take several minutes to become available, as all DB migrations and example data loading is performed upon startup.\r\n- If the environment fails to startup, for example, if the Docker image is not yet built and pushed to ECR, a comment will also be posted to the PR:\r\n<img width=\"925\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-17 at 1 04 21 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/296227/108267928-b08f3700-7120-11eb-8c9b-99ed915ce095.png\">\r\n\r\n### Security\r\nThe enclosed workflows follow [Github's security guidelines](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests) for builds. Docker images are built via the read-only `pull_request` event, preventing malicious code from accessing tokens with repo write access. `workflow_run` and `issue_comment` privileged workflows are limited to uploading and interacting with the AWS API, not building or running any of the untrusted code.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- Follow the procedure in [Running](#Running), above. _Note that the `workflow_run` and `issue_comment` workflows will not run until they are merged to `master`._\r\n- These workflows have been tested pretty extensively on [my fork of Superset](https://github.com/robdiciuccio/incubator-superset/pulls).\r\n\r\n### TODO (in future PRs)\r\n- Add handler for `/testenv down` command to manually shutdown environments\r\n- Automate shutting down server resources after ~48h\r\n- Shutdown and cleanup on PR close\r\n- Add support for celery and async jobs\r\n- Add support for feature flag and configuration overrides\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n[shillelagh](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/) is a Python module that provides a SQLAlchemy dialect and DB API 2.0 implementation to a variety of non-SQL resources. For example, it can be used to query CSV files or fetch weather data from https://www.weatherapi.com/ via SQL. The library has 100% unit test coverage and uses SQLite virtual tables to allow efficiently accessing the resources as if they were tables in a database.\r\n\r\nThe current module that we use to access Google Spreadsheets is [gsheetsdb](https://github.com/betodealmeida/gsheets-db-api/), which depends on the unmaintained [moz-sql-parser](https://github.com/mozilla/moz-sql-parser). In addition to the dependency, `gsheetsdb` implements a code transpiler, and uses pre and post-processors to fetch data from the spreadsheet, making the code somewhat brittle.\r\n\r\nThis week I implemented [a Google Spreadsheets adapter in shillelagh](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/blob/master/src/shillelagh/adapters/api/gsheets.py), aiming to deprecate the `gsheetsdb` module. The implementation is a drop-in replacement, and users should be able to uninstall the `gsheetsdb` module and install the `shillelagh` module to have existing queries, datasets and charts continue working.\r\n\r\nThis works because `shillelagh` [registers a SQLAlchemy dialect called \"gsheets\"](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/blob/master/setup.cfg#L83). This way SQLAlchemy will use `shillelagh` for all engines with the URL \"gsheets://\". This is an [in-memory only backend](https://github.com/betodealmeida/shillelagh/blob/e53bd116d5ffb2f8a99f29ad3913ab50300d373e/src/shillelagh/backends/apsw/dialect.py#L146), without access to the filesystem, so it's safe to use.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `shillelagh` also registers its own dialect (aptly named \"shillelagh\", with an alias called \"shillelagh+apsw\"). That dialect is unsafe, as a malicious user could use it to read data from the filesystem by enabling the CSV adapter. For security reasons, I disabled the \"shillelagh\" dialect unless `PREVENT_UNSAFE_DB_CONNECTIONS` is on.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nDue to Mapbox controls being loaded from different origin, it was impossible to convert Mapbox canvas to base64 encoded image due to CORS policy of `HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL` method (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL#exceptions). This PR fixes it by filtering out div that contains control elements (such as Mapbox logo).\r\nThis PR needs https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins-deckgl/pull/25 and https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/965 to be merged and respective packages to be bumped to work properly. Mapbox and DeckGL components need to have `preserveDrawingBuffer` prop set to true - otherwise only a gray background is getting captured. This change may affect performance of MapBox and DeckGL charts - I'd appreciate some stress tests and verifying if performance is acceptable when compared to current version\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nReported in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13087#issuecomment-780497250. An update was made to all menu links in order to standardize superset urls (always ending in a `/`) to facilitate matching against frontend routes. SQL Lab was exposed as `/sqllab` which was causing a 404. This PR standardizes the SQL Lab url. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is for improving code coverage.\r\nInside the folder `/superset-frontend/src/component`  there is the `Loading.tsx` component, which had no tests or storybook.\r\nIn this PR, I am making the following changes:\r\n- Moving the file to the \"Loading/index\" folder to maintain compatibility with imports that already exist.\r\n- Creating the storybook for the component\r\n- Creating unit tests for the component. Ensuring that it is working properly\r\n\r\nIn order to make the storybook work properly, it was necessary to insert a new prop (optional), which receives the path of the loading image.\r\nWhen creating the build, the images are placed in the folder `/static/assets/images/` while in the storybook it is not possible to make this mapping and the images are in the \"/images/\" folder. The prop \"image\" has been inserted to make it possible to display the image correctly. However, the default value of this prop remains the original value, not changing the current behavior","created_at":"2021-02-17T16:40:36Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:43:19Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T08:43:10Z","merged_at":"2021-02-18T08:43:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"f85497e69bb37ea6847cd6640062fdc1e145037a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ktmud","id":335541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud","html_url":"https://github.com/ktmud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"etr2460","id":7409244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7409244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460","html_url":"https://github.com/etr2460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2746846622,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ2ODQ2NjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/test:component","name":"test:component","color":"93DEE0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nFix for issue https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11359, https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9406\r\n\r\nWhen using LDAP authentication with presto/trino, the current behavior is just to modify the URL to replace the username which will result in an unauthorized exception. This PR will fix this by updating the connection argument with the effective user. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nStep 1: Setup database connection to presto without credentials in URL.\r\nStep 2: Provide admin(who can impersonate as any other user in presto) credentials in connection properties via extras  \r\n```\r\n\"engine_params\": {\r\n           \"connect_args\":{\r\n              \"protocol\": \"https\",\r\n              \"username\":\"<admin>\",\r\n              \"password\":\"<admin_password>\"\r\n           }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 3: Enable impersonation for the database connection. \r\nStep 4: Log in with a different user and run the query via SQL lab and you will see the **principal user** as admin and **user** as the logged-in user in presto UI.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nSome databases return sets in the dict payload (they should be lists according to the [docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/reflection.html#sqlalchemy.engine.reflection.Inspector.get_pk_constraint)) when calling `inspector.get_pk_constraint` which doesn't serialize to JSON. In addition, an empty set evaluates to truthy vs lists that evaluate to falsy, causing trouble downstream. By normalizing to JSON serializable datatypes we ensure that the response for the external metadata endpoint will return a valid response.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAfter some back and forth on https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9880, I think it makes sense to provide a docker-compose workflow for non-dev use cases. Waiting for assets to build is a common pain point for users who just want to try out superset and I image we're losing quite a few adopters along the way. \r\n\r\nWith this new workflow, I was able to get superset up an running in < 1 minute. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up` in the base of repo\r\n- after a few seconds, superset is up and running at `localhost:8088`\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFixes an issue with dynamic plugin state if there are no registered plugins. The state previously would get stuck in \"loading\" mode.\r\n\r\nA more refined future solution will be to distinguish between plugins that are \"fetched\" aka their metadata is known, and plugins that have been \"mounted\" aka their bundle is imported and their code has run. That will be a bigger PR than this one :)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to
