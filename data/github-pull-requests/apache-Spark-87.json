What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `SparkSession.addArtifact(s)`. The logic is basically translated from Scala (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40256) to Python here.\r\n\r\nOne difference is that, it does not support `class` files and `cache` (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40827) because it's not realistic for Python client to add `class` files. For `cache`, this implementation will be used as a base work.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a base work to implement sending py-files and archive files\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor feature parity w/ Scala client. In addition, this is also base work for `cache` implementation, and Python dependency management (https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this exposes an API `SparkSession.addArtifact(s)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added. Also manually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-22T05:07:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:39Z","closed_at":"2023-05-23T03:56:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82c692e7511ef91511b1f296dbc9757a3904ea20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update K8s doc to recommend K8s 1.24+.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**1. Default K8s Version in Public Cloud environments**\r\n\r\nAs of today (2023 May), the default K8s versions of public cloud providers moved on to K8s 1.24+ already.\r\n\r\n- EKS: v1.26 (Default)\r\n- GKE: v1.24 (Stable), v1.25 (Regular), v1.27 (Rapid)\r\n\r\n**2. End Of Support**\r\n\r\nIn addition, K8s 1.23 and olders are going to reach EOL when Apache Spark 3.5.0 arrives. K8s 1.24 also will reach EOL in some cloud providers.\r\n\r\n| K8s  |   AKS   |   GKE   |   EKS   |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| 1.23 | 2023-03 | 2023-07 | 2023-10 |\r\n| 1.24 |

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a documentation-only change about K8s versions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases, bug fixed as follow:\r\n- Fix issue in buf build and buf generate where the use of type filtering (via --type flags) would cause the resulting image to have no source code info, even when --exclude-source-info was not specified. The main impact of the bug was that\r\ngenerated code would be missing comments.\r\n- Fix issue in buf curl when using --user or --netrc that would cause a malformed Authorization header to be sent.\r\n\r\n2.https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/compare/v1.18.0...v1.19.0\r\n\r\n3.Manually test: dev/connect-gen-protos.sh, this upgrade will not change the generated files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test and Pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `cannotBroadcastTableOverMaxTableBytesError` to use `bytesToString` instead of shift operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid user confusion by giving more accurate values. For example, `maxBroadcastTableBytes` is 1GB and `dataSize` is `2GB - 1 byte`.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\nCannot broadcast the table that is larger than 1GB: 1 GB.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\nCannot broadcast the table that is larger than 1024.0 MiB: 2048.0 MiB.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate all tags in a `Project` while resolving of expressions and missing columns in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41064 . `LocalRelaton` is heavily used in tests and it's better to not report row count in tests to avoid the query being optimized too well which may hurt test coverage.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `LocalRelaton` to not report row count in tests, and adds a test-only config to still enable it in tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nkeep test coverage\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new configuration `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.python` that sets the Python executable on worker nodes.\r\n\r\nNote that, if the Python executable is different from the one previously ran, it will creates a new Python worker processes because we reuse Python workers but they are unique by both executable path and env variables as a key:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d7a8b852eaa6cc04df1eea0018a9b9de29b1c4fe/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkEnv.scala#L123-L124\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a basework for Spark Connect to support a different set of dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis can be useful especially when you want to run your Python with a different set of dependencies during runtime (see also https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this PR adds a configuration but that's internal for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nspark.range(1).select(udf(lambda x: sys.executable)(\"id\")).show(truncate=False)\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pyspark.python\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark provides the `GenTPCDSData` to generates TPCDS table data by using tpcds-kit: https://github.com/databricks/tpcds-kit.\r\n\r\nIf users want generates TPCDS table data, we can run:\r\n`build/sbt \"sql/Test/runMain <this class> --dsdgenDir <path> --location <path> --scaleFactor 1\"`\r\n\r\nIf the scale factor is smaller, such as: scaleFactor < 100, `GenTPCDSData` works good. otherwise, OOM issues prevent generating data.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] 16:43:41.618 ERROR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix [Supported pandas API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/supported_pandas_api.html#supported-pandas-api)  page to point out the proper pandas version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we're supporting pandas 1.5, but it says we support latest pandas which is 2.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's document change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.","created_at":"2023-05-18T01:40:26Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:35:00Z","closed_at":"2023-05-18T03:05:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ea8762d7dd5928f0722fc7beca75c1d6d519840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

We're not fully support the pandas 2.0.0, so the information \"Pandas API on Spark follows for the pandas 2.0\" is not correct.\r\n- We should list all the APIs that no longer support `inplace` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCorrectness for migration notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, only updating migration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate all tags in a `Project` while resolving of expressions and missing columns in `ColumnResolutionHelper.resolveExprsAndAddMissingAttrs()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the bug reproduced by the query below:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> WITH\r\n                   >   t1 AS (select key from values ('a') t(key)),\r\n                   >   t2 AS (select key from values ('a') t(key))\r\n                   > SELECT t1.key\r\n                   > FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 USING (key)\r\n                   > WHERE t1.key NOT LIKE 'bb.%';\r\n[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name `t1`.`key` cannot be resolved. Did you mean one of the following? [`key`].; line 4 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. It fixes a bug, and outputs the expected result: `a`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy new test added to `using-join.sql`:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z using-join.sql\"\r\n```\r\nand the related test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a null pointer thrown when non-foldable values are provided to the lgConfigK or allowDifferentLgConfigK arguments of the hll_sketch_agg, hll_union_agg, or hll_union functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe should be handling this error gracefully, rather than throwing a null pointer exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR introduces two new error messages, replacing what would be null pointer exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThree new negative test cases have been added to the 'SPARK-16484: hll_*_agg + hll_union negative tests' test of the DataframeAggregateSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-17T16:31:53Z","updated_at":"2023-09-16T00:16:35Z","closed_at":"2023-09-16T00:16:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30790622a0690312153c0761887b6c786d413566","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a169cec7118f3e3e4c9584d2b45e37a402d38dfc","head":{"label":"RyanBerti:SPARK-16484_check_for_non_foldable_inputs","ref":"SPARK-16484_check_for_non_foldable_inputs","sha":"a169cec7118f3e3e4c9584d2b45e37a402d38dfc","user":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":583148820,"node_id":"R_kgDOIsIlFA","name":"spark","full_name":"RyanBerti/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RyanBerti","id":17288675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg4Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17288675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanBerti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RyanBerti/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding working directory into classpath on the driver in K8S cluster mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter #37417, the spark.files, spark.jars are placed  in the working directory.\r\nBut seems that the spark context classloader can not access them because they are not in the classpath by default.\r\nThis pr adds the current working directory into classpath, so that the spark.files, spark.jars placed in the working directory can be accessible by the classloader.\r\nFor example, the `hive-site.xml` uploaded by `spark.files`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, users do not need to add the working directory into spark classpath manually.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT.","created_at":"2023-05-17T14:42:49Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T02:39:02Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T22:38:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bcffd3699ac471e9fa2d33c971ddbd71c6d0a51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11b5288de0bcd2ef3f67c2c347e50a451e440d45","head":{"label":"turboFei:work_dir_classpath","ref":"work_dir_classpath","sha":"11b5288de0bcd2ef3f67c2c347e50a451e440d45","user":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77131854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzEzMTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"turboFei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe metrics type for spark counter metrics exported to statsD are mapped to gauge instead of counter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDue to spark counter metrics being cumulative and statsD counter metrics being delta, there is a contract mismatch between them. This leads to aggregation both on client(spark) and server(statsD) side, which results in the value of the metrics being wrong. Since StatsD does not do aggregation on gauge metric, spark should send its cumulative metrics as gauge too, to obtain correct value of the metric.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe counter metrics that are exported by statsD to any backends will be changed to gauge metrics instead of counter metrics. Any application that processes gauge and counter metrics differently will need to account for this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT has been

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims upgrade ASM related dependencies in the `tools` module from version 7.1 to version 9.4 to make `GenerateMIMAIgnore` can process Java 17+ compiled code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pr defines `asm.version` to manage versions of ASM.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe classpath processed by `GenerateMIMAIgnore` cannot contain Java 17+ compiled code now due to the ASM version use by `tools` module is too low, but https://github.com/bmc/classutil has not been updated for a long time, we can't solve the problem by upgrading `classutil`, so this pr make the `tools` module explicitly rely on ASM 9.4 for workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. add a new feature step to handle special environment variables, such as `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`\r\n   * pull these special env variables and reorder them in a new config map\r\n   * mount the config map in driver and/or executor's container\r\n   * export these env variables by leverage sh/bash's `.` capability in the `entrypoint.sh`\r\n   * update original container's env list with special envs excluded\r\n2. support `spark.executor.exraLibraryPath` on K8S by leveraging the new feature step\r\n3. update `spark-rbac.yaml` to including more permissions, which was found when add integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. support `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath` on k8s\r\n2. feature parity with spark on yarn. Spark on yarn handles this environment variables that need to be substituted correctly.\r\n3. K8S itself cannot substitute variables in the container spec, we have to do some extra work at the entrypoint.sh\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before this PR, for spark running on K8S, `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath` doesn't take effect and cannot support \r\nvariable substitution.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. added new UTs\r\n2. added new integration test\r\n3. [WIP] verifing in the real prod

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `log4j-1.2-api` and `log4j-slf4j2-impl` to classpath if active `hadoop-provided`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix log issue.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce this issue:\r\n1. Build Spark:\r\n   ```\r\n   ./dev/make-distribution.sh --name provided --tgz -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn -Phadoop-provided\r\n   tar -zxf spark-3.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-provided.tgz \r\n   ```\r\n2. Copy the following jars to spark-3.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-provided/jars:\r\n   ```\r\n   guava-14.0.1.jar\r\n   hadoop-client-api-3.3.5.jar\r\n   hadoop-client-runtime-3.3.5.jar\r\n   hadoop-shaded-guava-1.1.1.jar\r\n   hadoop-yarn-server-web-proxy-3.3.5.jar\r\n   slf4j-api-2.0.7.jar\r\n   ```\r\n3. Add a new log4j2.properties to spark-3.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-provided/conf:\r\n   ```\r\n   rootLogger.level = info\r\n   rootLogger.appenderRef.file.ref = File\r\n   rootLogger.appenderRef.stderr.ref = console\r\n   \r\n   appender.console.type = Console\r\n   appender.console.name = console\r\n   appender.console.target = SYSTEM_ERR\r\n   appender.console.layout.type = PatternLayout\r\n   appender.console.layout.pattern = %d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} %p [%t] %c{2}:%L : %m%n\r\n   \r\n   appender.file.type = RollingFile\r\n   appender.file.name = File\r\n   appender.file.fileName = /tmp/spark/logs/spark.log\r\n   appender.file.filePattern = /tmp/spark/logs/spark.%d{yyyyMMdd-HH}.log\r\n   appender.file.append = true\r\n   appender.file.layout.type = PatternLayout\r\n   appender.file.layout.pattern = %d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} %p [%t] %c{2}:%L : %m%n\r\n   appender.file.policies.type = Policies\r\n   appender.file.policies.time.type = TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy\r\n   appender.file.policies.time.interval = 1\r\n   appender.file.policies.time.modulate = true\r\n   appender.file.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy\r\n   appender.file.policies.size.size = 256M\r\n   appender.file.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy\r\n   appender.file.strategy.max = 100\r\n   ```\r\n4. Start Spark thriftserver: `sbin/start-thriftserver.sh`.\r\n\r\n5. The log file is empty: `cat /tmp/spark/logs/spark.log`.\r\n\r\n6. Copy the following jars to spark-3.5.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-provided/jars:\r\n   ```\r\n   log4j-1.2-api-2.20.0.jar\r\n   log4j-slf4j2-impl-2.20.0.jar\r\n   ```\r\n7. Restart Spark thriftserver: `sbin/start-thriftserver.sh`.\r\n\r\n8. The log file is not empty: `cat /tmp/spark/logs/spark.log`.\r\n\r\nThis is because hadoop classpath does not contain these jars. So these jars are needed even if `hadoop-provided` is activated\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/5399861/d53ff28c-05d7-40d7-891f-069449315217)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProtobuf functions (`from_protobuf()` & `to_protobuf()`) take file path of a descriptor file and use that for constructing Protobuf descriptors. \r\nMain problem with how this is that the file is read many times (e.g. at each executor). This is unnecessary and error prone. E.g. file contents may be updated couple of days after a streaming query starts. That could lead to various errors. \r\n\r\n**The fix**: Use the byte content (which is serialized `FileDescritptorSet` proto). We read the content from the file once and carry the byte buffer. \r\n\r\nThis also adds new API where we can pass the byte buffer directly. This is useful when the users fetch the content themselves and passes it to Protobuf functions. E.g. they could fetch it from S3, or extract it Python Protobuf classes. \r\n\r\n**Note to reviewers**: This includes a lot of updates to test files, mainly because the interface change to pass the buffer. I have left a few PR comments to help with the review.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this adds two new versions for `from_protobuf()` and `to_protobuf()` API that take Protobuf bytes rather than file path. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-16T23:19:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-27T15:20:03Z","closed_at":"2023-05-27T15:19:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55097710e90686df06672e33f8351240dd47bb46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13d5e720f794e2a426375507599ec64607d8d923","head":{"label":"rangadi:proto-file-buffer","ref":"proto-file-buffer","sha":"13d5e720f794e2a426375507599ec64607d8d923","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the SQL compiler to support general constnat expressions in the syntax for CREATE/REPLACE TABLE OPTIONS values, rather than restricting to a few types of literals only.\r\n\r\n* The analyzer now checks that the provided expressions are in fact `foldable`, and throws an error message otherwise.\r\n* This error message that users encounter in these cases improves from a general \"syntax error at or near <location>\" to instead indicate that the syntax is valid, but only constant expressions are supported in these contexts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to provide OPTIONS lists in SQL, supporting use cases like concatenating strings with `||`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the SQL syntax changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit test coverage.","created_at":"2023-05-16T22:29:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T04:31:17Z","closed_at":"2023-06-12T04:31:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"364855896d44c3b8b57cd990285584b5093f64f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gerashegalov","id":3187938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3187938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov","html_url":"https://github.com/gerashegalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerashegalov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport duplicated field names in `createDataFrame` with pandas DataFrame.\r\n\r\nFor with Arrow, without Arrow, and Spark Connect:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show()\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n|struct_0|       struct_1|\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n|  {a, 1}|{2, 3, b, 4, c}|\r\n|  {x, 6}|{7, 8, y, 9, z}|\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf there are duplicated field names, `createDataFrame` with pandas DataFrame fallbacks to without Arrow, or fails in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>>\r\n>>> schema = (\r\n...     StructType()\r\n...     .add(\"struct_0\", StructType().add(\"x\", StringType()).add(\"x\", IntegerType()))\r\n...     .add(\r\n...         \"struct_1\",\r\n...         StructType()\r\n...         .add(\"a\", IntegerType())\r\n...         .add(\"x\", IntegerType())\r\n...         .add(\"x\", StringType())\r\n...         .add(\"y\", IntegerType())\r\n...         .add(\"y\", StringType()),\r\n...     )\r\n... )\r\n>>>\r\n>>> data = [Row(Row(\"a\", 1), Row(2, 3, \"b\", 4, \"c\")), Row(Row(\"x\", 6), Row(7, 8, \"y\", 9, \"z\"))]\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame.from_records(data, columns=schema.names)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Without Arrow:\r\n\r\nWorks fine.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show()\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n|struct_0|       struct_1|\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n|  {a, 1}|{2, 3, b, 4, c}|\r\n|  {x, 6}|{7, 8, y, 9, z}|\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n- With Arrow:\r\n\r\nWorks with fallback.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show()\r\n/.../pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py:347: UserWarning: createDataFrame attempted Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled' is set to true; however, failed by the reason below:\r\n  [DUPLICATED_FIELD_NAME_IN_ARROW_STRUCT] Duplicated field names in Arrow Struct are not allowed, got [x, x].\r\nAttempting non-optimization as

c}|\r\n|  {x, 6}|{7, 8, y, 9, z}|\r\n+--------+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spark Connect\r\n\r\nFails.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show()\r\n...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.IllegalArgumentException: not all nodes and buffers were consumed. ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe duplicated field names will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- The pr aims to add check rules, importing in `collection`(instead with `scala.collection`) format is not allowed.\r\n- Adjust the code import according to the above rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI found that some developers sometimes write `collection.JavaConverters._` when import `JavaConverters._`, while others write `scala.JavaConverters._`\r\nActually, they all belong to the `scala group`, so it is necessary for us to specify a clearer rule to make the code style more consistent\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade mysql-connector-java from 8.0.32 to 8.0.33\r\n`Version 8.0.33 is the latest General Availability release of the 8.0 series of MySQL Connector/J. It is suitable for use with MySQL Server versions 8.0 and 5.7. It supports the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) 4.2 API, and implements the X DevAPI.`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.This version brings some bugs fixes, the release note as follows:\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/8.0/en/news-8-0-33.html\r\n\r\n2.Bugs Fixed(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/connector-j/8.0/en/news-8-0-33.html#connector-j-8-0-33-bug), eg:\r\n\r\n- When connecting to MySQL Server 5.7 and earlier with Connector/J 8.0.32, Connector/J sometimes hung after the prepare phase of a server-side prepared statement. (Bug #109864, Bug #35034666)\r\nReferences: This issue is a regression of: Bug #33968169.\r\n\r\n- Results returned by the getPrimaryKeys() method of the DatabaseMetadata interface were not sorted by COLUMN_NAME as required by the JDBC specification. (Bug #109808, Bug #35021038)\r\n\r\n- Results returned by the getTypeInfo() method of the DatabaseMetadata interface were not sorted by DATA_TYPE as required by the JDBC specification. (Bug #109807, Bug #35021014)\r\n\r\n- Rewriting of batched statements failed when a closing parenthesis was found within a VALUES clause. It was because QueryInfo failed to parse the prepared statement properly in that case. With this fix, the parser of VALUES clauses is improved, so that Connector/J is now able to recognize rewritability of statements that contain function calls or multiple VALUES lists, and it also handles well the cases when the string \"value\" is part of a table name, a column name, or a keyword. (Bug #109377, Bug #34900156, Bug #107577, Bug #34325361)\r\n\r\n- Before executing a query with Statement.executeQuery(query), Connector/J checks if the query is going to produce results and rejects it if it cannot. The check wrongly rejected queries that had a WITH clause in which there was no space after the comma between two common table expressions. (Bug #109243, Bug #34852047)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.","created_at":"2023-05-16T04:29:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T16:48:38Z","closed_at":"2023-05-16T16:47:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6144e8253ab15ebb78bf7a93fb7c5da5cc6ac194","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8c4f5ee362f61bf4344002091c86c852cc845b9","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-43520","ref":"SPARK-43520","sha":"e8c4f5ee362f61bf4344002091c86c852cc845b9","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this pr, for spark on k8s, the hadoop config map will be mounted in executor side as well.\r\nBefore, the  hadoop config map is only mounted in driver side.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-25815](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25815) [,](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22911,) the hadoop config map will not be mounted in executor side.\r\n\r\nPer the  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22911 description:\r\n\r\n> The main two things that don't need to happen in executors anymore are:\r\n> 1. adding the Hadoop config to the executor pods: this is not needed\r\n> since the Spark driver will serialize the Hadoop config and send\r\n> it to executors when running tasks. \r\n\r\nBut in fact, the executor still need the hadoop configuration.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/6757692/ff6374c9-7ebd-4472-a85c-99c75a737e2a)\r\n\r\nAs shown in above picture, the driver can resolve `hdfs://zeus`, but the executor can not.\r\n\r\nso we still need to mount the hadoop config map in executor side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users do not need to take workarounds to make executors load the hadoop configuration.\r\nSuch as:\r\n- including hadoop conf in executor image\r\n- placing hadoop conf files under `SPARK_CONF_DIR`.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to convert _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2029 to INTERNAL_ERROR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. I found that it can only be triggered it with the parameter value: UP,DOWN,HALF_DOWN,UNNECESSARY, but from a user's perspective, it is impossible (the internal code limits its value to only: HALF_UP,HALF_EVEN,CEILING,FLOOR), so we should convert it to an internal error.\r\n2. The changes improve the error framework.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Update existed UT.\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKeep track of completed container ids in YarnAllocator and don't update internal state of a container if it's already completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nYarnAllocator updates internal state adding running executors after executor launch in a separate thread. That can happen after the containers are already completed (e.g. preempted) and processed by YarnAllocator. Then YarnAllocator mistakenly thinks there are still running executors which are already lost. As a result, application hangs without any running executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-15T16:07:23Z","updated_at":"2023-06-06T13:29:49Z","closed_at":"2023-06-06T13:29:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35eb89343beeb8c00eb637c4bc96731f17c66885","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14b50f303dc2c934397c10e3f2b98b3974c258ad","head":{"label":"manuzhang:spark-43510","ref":"spark-43510","sha":"14b50f303dc2c934397c10e3f2b98b3974c258ad","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132739917,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI3Mzk5MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"manuzhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add a max distance argument to the levenshtein() function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Spark's levenshtein(str1, str2) function can be very inefficient for long strings. Many other databases which support this type of built-in function also take a third argument which signifies a maximum distance after which it is okay to terminate the algorithm.\r\n\r\nFor example something like:\r\n`levenshtein(str1, str2[, max_distance])`\r\n\r\nthe function stops computing the distant once the max values is reached.\r\nSee postgresql for an example of a 3 argument [levenshtein](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fuzzystrmatch.html#id-1.11.7.26.7).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. sparkConf's getOption/get supports substitution for raw keys\r\n2. sparkConf's getAllWithPrefix supports substitution for values\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be consistent between `sparkConf.get(CONFIG_ENTRY_A)` and `sparkConf.get(CONFIG_ENTRY_A.key)`. \r\nIt's also a todo left for: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18394#discussion_r126241078\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Some values contain env/sys variables, such as `${env:xxx}`, `${sys:yyy}` might be substituted by the real one. \r\nHowever I doubt that's rarely possibel\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.","created_at":"2023-05-15T04:04:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-03T00:18:07Z","closed_at":"2023-09-03T00:18:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f646307bd508b91131e812dd4b67d04ee622e2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82ced575c88d0eac146f5480f77e28b8d474bdb6","head":{"label":"advancedxy:SPARK-43454","ref":"SPARK-43454","sha":"82ced575c88d0eac146f5480f77e28b8d474bdb6","user":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18693947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODY5Mzk0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"advancedxy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow expression lineage through partial aggregation (AggregatePart) and Window operators. This enables optimizations such as DFP, bloom filters to trace down expression lineage and do necessary optimizations.\r\n\r\nAlso, enhanced the logic to accept the following additional parameters to be able to customize lineage logic.\r\n\r\nnoLineageOnNullPaddingSide: If true, lineage is not tracked down through the null padding side of the outer joins.\r\n\r\nstopAtSubPlan: If specified, lineage tracking stops at this specified operator.\r\n\r\nCode changes include delegating the core logic to findExpressionAndTrackLineageDownBase() and the current signature findExpressionAndTrackLineageDown() would become wrapper to avoid changes to the existing callers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support optimizations such as bloom filters, DFP, etc. which depend on the expression lineage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

Spark SQL calculates `0 in ('00') ` as false in 3.1.1, which act different from `=` keyword, but Hive calculates true in 3.1.0 and false in 2.3.3. Hive has fixed the `in` keyword in 3.1.0, but SparkSQL does not.\r\nfor example, this two query sql should have same result, how ever, the query result is different:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1 as test where 0 in ('00')\").show;\r\n+----+\r\n|test|\r\n+----+\r\n+----+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1 as test where 0 = '00'\").show;\r\n+----+                                                                          \r\n|test|\r\n+----+\r\n|   1|\r\n+----+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nhive 2.3.3\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/132866841/417768c8-3dda-49a4-9629-aba5fca39e3e)\r\n\r\nhive 3.1.0\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/132866841/65edf7fd-0c1c-457b-97f3-c2fb399156b3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWe add a switch to support `In` expression compatible with `EqualTo` expression with false as default value, to make sure it will not change default behavior of Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy set spark.sql.legacy.inExpressionCompatibleWithEqualTo.enabled=true/false, to check whether the analyzed logical plan will cast expression as expected. For true, it will generate same Cast logical plan as EqualTo, and false will keep the old Cast logical plan solution.","created_at":"2023-05-13T09:01:29Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T00:17:55Z","closed_at":"2023-10-17T00:17:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac3ba57a377c789ad1dc7cec7b8eaec241e2ef0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12656bc5bb5f58b880e85af171504c04affa5989","head":{"label":"liukuijian8040:In_Expression_Compatible_With_EqualTo","ref":"In_Expression_Compatible_With_EqualTo","sha":"12656bc5bb5f58b880e85af171504c04affa5989","user":{"login":"liukuijian8040","id":132866841,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-tjGQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132866841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040","html_url":"https://github.com/liukuijian8040","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":640096639,"node_id":"R_kgDOJicZfw","name":"spark","full_name":"liukuijian8040/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liukuijian8040","id":132866841,"node_id":"U_kgDOB-tjGQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132866841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040","html_url":"https://github.com/liukuijian8040","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukuijian8040/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liukuijian8040/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #40988.\r\n\r\nFixes `df.toPandas` to support empty columns.\r\n\r\nThe result will be no-column, same-length

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the rules of `primaryExpression` in `SqlBaseParser.g4`, and two more functions `DATE_ADD` and `DATE_DIFF` that accept 3-args in the same way as the existing expressions `DATEADD` and `DATEDIFF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo do not confuse users and improve user experience with Spark SQL. There are the `DATE_ADD` and `DATE_DIFF` aliases for 2-args functions: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/46332d985e52f76887c139f67d1471b82e85d5ca/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/FunctionRegistry.scala#L606-L607\r\n\r\nbut Spark SQL doesn't provide 3-args `DATE_ADD` and `DATE_DIFF`. And Spark SQL outputs the confusing error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select date_add(MONTH, 1, date'2023-05-13');\r\n[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name `MONTH` cannot be resolved. ; line 1 pos 16;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only if user code depends on the error class. After the changes, Spark SQL outputs an result similar to `DATEADD`/`DATEDIFF`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select date_add(MONTH, 1, date'2023-05-13');\r\n2023-06-13 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe example here is multiplying Decimal(38, 10) by another Decimal(38, 10), but I think it can be reproduced with other number combinations, and possibly with divide too.\r\n```scala\r\nSeq(\"9173594185998001607642838421.5479932913\").toDF.selectExpr(\"CAST(value as DECIMAL(38,10)) as a\").selectExpr(\"a * CAST(-12 as DECIMAL(38,10))\").show(truncate=false)\r\n```\r\nThis produces an answer in Spark of `-110083130231976019291714061058.575920` But if I do the calculation in regular java BigDecimal I get `-110083130231976019291714061058.575919`\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBigDecimal l = new BigDecimal(\"9173594185998001607642838421.5479932913\");\r\nBigDecimal r = new BigDecimal(\"-12.0000000000\");\r\nBigDecimal prod = l.multiply(r);\r\nBigDecimal rounded_prod = prod.setScale(6, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark does essentially all of the same operations, but it used Decimal to do it instead of java's BigDecimal directly. Spark, by way of Decimal, will set a `MathContext` for the multiply operation that has a max precision of 38 and will do half up rounding. That means that the result of the multiply operation in Spark is `-110083130231976019291714061058.57591950`, but for the java BigDecimal code the result is `-110083130231976019291714061058.57591949560000000000`. Then Spark will call `toPrecision` to round up again. So Spark round up result twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR change the code-gen and `nullSafeEval` of `Arithmetic`. To make sure when use multiply method will set custom `MathContext` with precision of 39 (meaning one more scale). Then round up twice will not affect result.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTrigger `committer.setupJob` before plan execute in `FileFormatWriter#write`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this issue, the case where `outputOrdering` might not work if AQE is enabled has been resolved.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38358\r\n\r\nHowever, since it materializes the AQE plan in advance (triggers getFinalPhysicalPlan) , it may cause the committer.setupJob(job) to not execute When `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec#getFinalPhysicalPlan()` is executed with an error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd
