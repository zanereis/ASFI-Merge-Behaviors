SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the [4.0 approved initiatives](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/292/views/1), this PR removes the `REMOVE_SLICE_LEVEL_LABEL_COLORS` feature flag. The feature flag was used to remove color-related attributes from a chart's form data to reduce payload when the chart was loaded as part of the dashboard initialization. These attributes are not loaded anymore making this optimization obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe previous value of the feature flag was `False` and now the feature is permanently removed.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient for merging this PR. We'll do a complete testing of 4.0 after all approved proposals are merged.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATIO\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-22T13:05:24Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T15:34:29Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T19:29:09Z","merged_at":"2024-01-17T19:29:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8d25612ba6c7a6ce61ba97c2c52d372c0dc870e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1157173956,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTU3MTczOTU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:breaking-change","name":"risk:breaking-change","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"Issues

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user performed an action that caused `directPathToChild` to point to an element outside of `DashboardContainer` (such as clicking on applied native filter's name in chart's header to highlight the native filter), it caused the tabs to switch to the first tab.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour to instead remain on current tab.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/0ff04c0c-c3ed-43d9-a061-438c72a7dd61\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/90e25fa9-0203-4c7a-867b-1578a3310753\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with tabs\r\n2. Apply some native filters, go to a chart in 2nd tab and click on filter's name in filters badge\r\n3. Verify that the native filter got highlighted, but the tab didn't switch\r\n4. Sometimes we _do_ expect the tabs to switch. For example, apply a cross filter to a chart in 2nd tab from a chart in 1st tab.\r\n5. Click on cross filter's name in filters badge in 2nd tab.\r\n6. Verify that the tab switched and the source chart is highlighted\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFor filter-box charts whenever the chart filters are changed we [log an event](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/5e85f5c81f66b2da6fa11d9112216004f35170c8/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/gridComponents/Chart.jsx#L275-L278) per the `LOG_ACTIONS_CHANGE_DASHBOARD_FILTER` action‚Äîcontaining the filter-box chart ID and the associated filtered dataset columns‚Äîwhich is useful for performance logging.\r\n\r\nThe native dashboard filters log no such event and thus this PR simply logs the same action whenever anyone clicks the `APPLY FILTERS` button. I omitted both the chart ID and columns from the payload. The former is obsolete and the later is somewhat irrelevant as (unlike a filter-box chart) there are multiple datasets/columns impacted. Simply logging the event is suffice for tracking when the filters were updated resulting in a re-render of the dashboard.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nVerified the action was logged to the `logs` table when the `APPLY FILTERS` button was clicked:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlite> SELECT json FROM logs WHERE

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is aimed to solve problem where guest user cannot view an embedded dashboard when async queries feature flag is turned on.\r\nAsync queries first cache query_context into cache. Then later on the query_context is re-constructed from cache which contains original access context in form_data and queries to fetch actual data for chart.\r\nBefore this PR, the form_data is never set into cache so that we lost the original access context(which embedded dashboard original request is accessing), thus security_manager will always raise for access.\r\nThe second part of this PR set guest_token temporarily into job_metadata so that when job_metadata passes to celery task, the task can use it to set the current user context so as to load rls properly, which fix the consistency issue between sync and async invoke of the cache key(cache key is calculated with rls and rls is based on current guest user context)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n<img width=\"714\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 2 15 46‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5824221/0f3c8640-f1a9-417f-b682-f6d603c42b30\">\r\n<img width=\"971\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 2 18 48‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5824221/d95fb376-ddcc-4431-b09a-e6b526687611\">\r\n<img width=\"1075\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 2 16 05‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5824221/7647c36b-7399-4f64-ab7b-e6ba160052d7\">\r\n<img width=\"1040\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 2 16 28‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5824221/9545dac2-56e6-46e8-bd44-d29910c936f0\">\r\n<img width=\"975\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 2 17 13‚ÄØPM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5824221/3249b914-f7c1-4d6d-a633-948b678079e7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. turn on `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag.\r\n2. go to a dashboard and make it embedded.\r\n3. view the embedded dashboard as a guest user(to logged in as guest user, you will need to call guest token API first and include the jwt in following API calls)\r\n4. notice that API calls to the dashboard e.g. `/api/v1/chart/data`, `/superset/explore_json`, `/api/v1/async_event/`(if polling mode), `/api/v1/chart/data/{key}` will all succeed and charts get rendered.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThis feature allows users to customize the email subject when creating a report or an alert within Superset. This is driven by a need to include specific parameters within the email subject line, enhancing the specificity and resonance of alert or report notifications. \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Implementation of a new text input field within the 'create alert/report' interface, through which users can specify their desired email subject line.\r\n- If the text field is left blank, a default email subject line will be generated by the system.\r\n- The user interface will show the new text field solely when the email sending method is selected by a user.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been tested with Superset master branch.\r\nThis proposed feature has already been discussed in the Superset Improvement Proposal (see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25945)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `LOG_ACTIONS_CHANGE_DASHBOARD_FILTER` action logs the chart ID and columns which a filter impacts. The issue is if one were to clear a filter the key still persists in the `newSelectedValues` object, i.e., `{'country_name': null}`, resulting in a misleading log entry.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply filters out any key in which the associated value is `null`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nVerified that when clearing the `COUNTRY_NAME` filter on the \"World Bank's Data\" dashboard the `country_name` column was not logged, i.e., the following SQL statement,\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n    json_extract(json, '$.columns')\r\nFROM \r\n    logs\r\nWHERE \r\n    json_extract(json, '$.event_name') = 'change_dashboard_filter' \r\nORDER BY\r\n    dttm DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturned:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[]\r\n[\"country_name\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nDashboard filter combinations are persisted in Superset through a URL parameter. This functionality is currently not compatible with Embedded (the dashboard doesn't emit a generated filter key up to the application that could be re-used in a refresh) so this PR removes the logic to write a filter key for embedded users.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Load a dashboard that contains filters in embedded mode.\r\n2. Validate that the embedded user is still able to apply filter combinations.\r\n3. Inspect the browser and validate through the Network tab that a request to `/api/v1/dashboard/{{DashboardID}}/filter_state?tab_id={{TabID}}` isn't being fired. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR follows the same standard defined by ECharts and disables [minor ticks](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#xAxis.minorTick.show) by default for ECharts charts. From a data visualization point of view, they only add visual noise/don‚Äôt facilitate reading the chart better for the majority of cases. For the specific cases where they might help with data interpretation, I added a new control that allows users to enable them. This will also help with consistency given that legacy charts also have minor ticks disabled by default. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1458\" alt=\"Screenshot

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nOk, so our little world of maps is a a heterogenous mess :) Time to clean house! This PR does the following:\r\n\r\n* Makes various updates to the Jupyter notebook to make it run reliably (there were some deprecated method and whatnot)\r\n* Adds a few countries (Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria) as a test\r\n* Takes stock of the maps in Superset that were NOT part of the notebook, and adds them\r\n  * many countries, like Austria, existed in geojson, but were not part of the notebook. Now they're generated by the notebook (which _might_ have unintended consequences)\r\n  * a couple of countries (france_regions and italy_regions, namely) can't be made by the notebook. These are now copied over by the notebook from a new directory of \"custom\" geojson files at run time\r\n*  geojson files now consistently use underscores instead of spaces in filenames\r\n* The typescript file that creates the select menu is now generated automatically. You can pretty much just add a country name to the notebook and let it rip to open a new country PR.\r\n* Some countries updated by the notebook (e.g. Sri Lanka) have notably different characteristics - these might generate some breaking changes unintentionally, but seem more correct, and better fit Superset's patterns.\r\n* Note: The `france_regions` map seems to be causing a browser meltdown before or after this PR. I'm not sure what's up with that.\r\n\r\nTODO (in this PR or subsequent ones)\r\n‚Ä¢ Figure out what's broken with the france_regions map \r\n‚Ä¢ Add documentation about this notebook to the CONTRIBUTING file\r\n‚Ä¢ Add codeowners to the relevant files to prevent more diverging maps\r\n‚Ä¢ Add more countries!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nI built a dataset of every airport in the world, and went through most, if not all, of the new maps. All work well except Sri Lanka, which I haven't gotten working with any dataset... there's something strange about their region codes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nAdd \"% Calculation\" field to Funnel chart's control panel. Currently, the % of each level of funnel chart is calculated as % of total. This PR allows user to also display % of each level as % of the first step or % of previous step.\r\n\r\nExample of calculations:\r\n\r\n| Value | Percent of total | Calculate from first step | Calculate from previous step |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | \r\n| 100 | 57% | 100% | 100% | \r\n| 50 | 28% | 50% | 50% | \r\n| 25 | 14% | 25% | 50% |\r\n\r\nThe default value for new charts is \"Calculate from first step\". For existing charts, a migration was added to keep \"Percent of total\" as selected option.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1721\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/f695bfd1-aa80-486a-9159-323b62bc6582\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1720\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/cc5a8279-d417-4d40-b3d7-ae047c13c067\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1724\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/7b581695-7685-4bf3-b6f1-142492ee590b\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

Friday afternoon PR. Whilst reviewing PRs earlier today I realized there were instances where the class ordering was incorrect, i.e., the [following](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/django-design-patterns/9781788831345/27a5a0c6-e477-4255-b8bb-3f21df30f761.xhtml) wasn't being adhered to:\r\n\r\n> Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines how they should be arranged. In a nutshell, mixins come first and base classes come last.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that, per Python's MRO the class inheritance is correctly defined. Potential problematic classes were identified by running `git grep Mixin)`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nDuckDB supports multiple databases. This means schemas can be specified as `<db name>.<schema name>`, e.g., `\"my db\".main`. However, when such a schema name is specified, it gets quoted as `\"my db.main\"` instead of `\"my db\".\"main\"`. This PR fixes that by using the `quote_schema` method of the `identifier_preparer` instead of `quote`. This method defaults to `identifier_preparer.quote` is overridden in the DuckDB sqlalchemy driver to parse the string and add quotes in the right places.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nValidating releases to check SHA-512 checksum and RSA signature against the apache KEYS file is a bit... tedious. \r\n\r\nThis adds a python script to the RELEASING folder (and documentation about it) so you can just run the script and check if the release is valid.\r\n\r\nOnce releases _contain_ this script, you can also run a bash script or npm script to validate the release from the scripts within.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up on #26215 by playing whack-a-mole on the numerical x-axis truncation problem. Move from using `dataMin`/`dataMax` to `scale: true` when truncating x-axis for bar charts. This applies automatic truncation by ECharts, which is able to handle truncation more gracefully. For other than bar charts, we'll retain the `dataMin`/`dataMax` logic without the `scale` parameter.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow there is a proper margin on the x-axis to not overlap y-axis.\r\n<img width=\"1213\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/ed17a87b-53de-461e-ab16-1255efd188d4\">\r\n\r\nNow also mixed series chart has the same functionality:\r\n<img width=\"1225\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/dbe2714b-9331-4f48-98a0-6dbfedf1b29a\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the smallest and largest bars would \r\n<img width=\"1223\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/c6294ba6-855a-4638-98e0-22e26ca1fdb6\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26087 added support for numerical x-axis but ended up introducing https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26255 and https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26256 because ECharts does not support stacked charts with numerical x-axis. This PR converts the x-axis to type `category` when a chart is stacked.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26255\r\nFixes:

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRequest to add support to enable annotations to secret resources. We have a specific use case as we use a secrets management tool to manage our Kubernetes secrets, but that requires annotations to be added to the secrets.\r\n\r\nI think others could benefit from this as common use cases for annotating secrets include:\r\n\r\n**Providing Additional Context:** Annotations can store additional information about the secret, such as a description of its contents, the purpose of the secret, or information about how it was generated.\r\n\r\n**Integration with Tools:** Many tools and systems that integrate with Kubernetes use annotations to store configuration or state information. For example, a tool that manages secret rotation might use annotations to store the last rotation date.\r\n\r\n**Versioning Information:** Annotations can be used to hold versioning information, especially if the secret is part of a CI/CD pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Security Markings:** In some cases, annotations might be used to hold security-related metadata, like compliance tags or access policies. However, it's important to remember that annotations are not a substitute for proper access control.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new entry in the values.yaml file called secretAnnotations and updates the secrets templates to support annotations. If users add custom annotations in the values.yaml file, they will be added to the secret resources and vice versa.\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRun `helm template` with custom annotations in the values.yaml file.  This will generate the template yaml files with annotations in kind secret resources.\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR that added support for numerical x-axes caused unintuitive results when the x-axis contained a highly constrained interval, e.g. the years 1980-2017. In this case, the x-axis was bounded between [0, 7000], causing a highly spiked appearance. This is in contrast with other visualization tools, that default automatically truncating the x-axis.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new x-axis truncation controls, similar to the existing ones for the y-axis. With this change, the x-axis will be truncated by default. If the lower and/or upper bounds are left undefined, they will default to the min and max values from the dataset (calculated automatically by ECharts). This ensures that the data is bounded correctly.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the x-axis is automatically truncated (see the new \"TRUNCATE X AXIS\" control, which defaults to being checked):\r\n<img width=\"1208\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/a84185fa-6cac-4e8f-ac5e-5ca0447f2859\">\r\n\r\nBy defining the lower and/or upper bound, the x-axis is updated accordingly:\r\n<img width=\"1216\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/7db264f8-f91a-475e-afd5-3b6ed7d938c4\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nWhen disabling x-axis truncation, the current \"dirac delta\"-like behavior is reproduced on the Video Game example chart:\r\n<img width=\"1222\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/650368e0-9cb8-464a-a0a0-0ba4c4300805\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's not possible to use links to custom protocols, despite adding them to `HTML_SANITIZATION_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS[\"protocols\"]` in `superset_config.py`. This is due to the fact that `ReactMarkdown` has built-in link sanitization functionality that's overlapping with the `rehypePlugins` that we're using.\r\n\r\nAs we're already using `rehype` to sanitize the markdown, it makes sense to disable the built-in sanitization. This can be done by setting `transformLinkUri={null}`. Here's what ChatGPT said about the change:\r\n\r\nMe:\r\n> So if I'm already sanitizing links using `rehype-sanitize`, I can safely set `transformLinkUri` to `null`? \r\n\r\nChatGPT:\r\n> Yes, if you're already using rehype-sanitize effectively to sanitize links, you can set transformLinkUri to null in react-markdown. Here's why:\r\n>\r\n> Role of transformLinkUri: In react-markdown, transformLinkUri is a function used for transforming or validating URLs in links. By default, it applies some basic security checks to URLs. Setting it to null disables these default transformations.\r\n> \r\n> Role of rehype-sanitize: If you're using rehype-sanitize, it sanitizes the HTML output of the Markdown conversion, including URLs in links. With a proper configuration, rehype-sanitize can ensure that only safe URLs are allowed, effectively preventing XSS attacks and other security vulnerabilities associated with links.\r\n> \r\n> Ensuring Adequate Sanitization: Before setting transformLinkUri to null, make sure that your rehype-sanitize configuration adequately covers your security needs. This includes specifying allowed protocols, attributes, and other elements. Your configuration should be strict enough to prevent unsafe URLs but flexible enough to allow your required content.\r\n> \r\n> Testing and Validation: After making this change, thoroughly test your application to ensure that no unsafe links are allowed. This should include testing with various types of links, especially edge cases, to confirm that the sanitizer works as expected.\r\n> \r\n> Security Best Practices: Always stay informed about security best practices and be prepared to update your sanitization strategy as new threats emerge. Regularly review and update your rehype-sanitize configuration to maintain robust security.\r\n> \r\n> In conclusion, setting transformLinkUri to null is safe as long as you're confident in your rehype-sanitize configuration and its ability to effectively sanitize links. Always ensure through testing and validation that your implementation maintains the security integrity of your application.\r\n\r\nOriginally, I wanted to add a RTL test that ensures the links render correctly with this change. However, we've had to disable `react-markdown` and the `rehype` libraries in our test suites due to ESM incompatibility with Jest:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b4a35e624b1bb37774aa290018383bbd2bf73ac2/superset-frontend/spec/helpers/shim.tsx#L87-L90\r\n\r\nFor this reason we're unable to add proper tests for `react-markdown` before it either adds CJS, or Jest fully supports ESM. I'm bumping Jest in the following PR to a more recent version: #26182 However, unfortunately this version doesn't yet work correctly with ESM, so it seems we may need to wait a while longer before this test can be added.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Checkout master branch\r\n2. Add the following to your `superset_config.py`: `HTML_SANITIZATION_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS = {\"protocols\": {\"href\": [\"foo\"] } }`\r\n3. Create a markdown component on a dashboard with a link to `foo://bar` and another one with `xyz://qwerty`\r\n4. Notice that both links point to `javascript:void()`\r\n5. Checkout this PR\r\n6. Notice that the first link now points to `foo://bar` as expected, and the other one is completely missing a `href` thanks to our rehype sanitization\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\n[26034](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26034) fixed a problem where numeric x-axis were being treated as categorical values. As a consequence of that, the way labels are displayed might change given that ECharts has a different treatment for numerical and categorical values. This PR adds a note to `UPDATING.md` explaining the changes to users and guiding them on how to restore the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ]

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26186 (though for non-Celery related workflows) this PR ensures that the remainder of the codebase (excluding tests and Alembic migrations) leverage the Flask-SQLAlchemy session (`db.session`).\r\n\r\nThis refactor helps to reduce the code complexity and ensures we're not generating any rouge sessions which are often not explicitly closed and can lead to connection pooling issues.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nAvoid de-normalizing column names in case the engine supports it **but column normalization is enabled in the dataset level**. This is enabled by default to datasets created prior to this feature, to make sure that syncing columns wouldn't break existing charts/etc.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/f30e8688-81c8-4019-b10d-4e4aaef932f6\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/31909ae1-91b7-4710-9c9e-3f531a344821\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dataset powered by an engine that supports column de-normalization (such as Snowflake). Note that:\r\n a. All columns are **uppercase**.\r\n b. Column normalization is disabled (under the **SETTINGS** tab).\r\n2. Modify the dataset, and enable column normalization.\r\n3. Save changes.\r\n4. Modify the dataset again, and sync columns. Note that all columns are now **lowercase**.\r\n5. Save changes.\r\n6. Create a new chart using this dataset, and drop any column in the FILTERS section.\r\n7. Validate the filter is showing available options in the dropdown.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26198\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-06T20:54:00Z","updated_at":"2025-02-04T19:14:37Z","closed_at":"2023-12-08T01:24:48Z","merged_at":"2023-12-08T01:24:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"05d7060d838271ae46176040bcdd02b6fa359c72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5111009119,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABMKPPXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v3.0","name":"v3.0","color":"0070C9","default":false,"description":"Label

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe goal of this PR is to eliminate unnecessary error logs.  The `retry_call` function uses the `backoff` lib to decorate functions we want to retry.  After the retry limit is reached, the `backoff` decorator generates a log saying that it's giving up.  This log defaults to the error level, which isn't necessary here since the exception raised by the wrapped function gets bubbled up and logged at the appropriate level already.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the issue by lowering the log from the `backoff` decorator to a warning\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs part of SIP-99 (specifically [SIP-99A](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25107) and [SIP-99B](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25108)) in order to ensure a consistent \"unit of work\"‚Äîvia a single atomic unit‚Äîall operations should be associated with the same Flask-SQLAlchemy session.\r\n\r\nThe Flask-SQLAlchemy extension provides a scoped session (on a per request basis) with the necessary oversight, i.e., the session is closed after the request is complete which aids with connection pool management. \r\n\r\nHistorically Celery tasks have defined their own scoped session (with the option to use connection pooling) which needed to managed independently which added unnecessary code bloat and complexity and likely violated the \"unit of work\" construct if operations were leveraging both the Flask-SQLAlchemy and Celery sessions. Per [this](https://gist.github.com/twolfson/a1b329e9353f9b575131) post it seems like Celery can piggyback off of the Flask-SQLAlchemy session so long as setup/teardown is handled correctly.  There is actually an example of this in the official Flask documentation per the [Celery with Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/celery/) document where it references the use of the Flask-SQLAlchemy session (`db.session`).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the need for a Celery specific session which is a step towards the goal of having all database operations (outside of the Alembic migrations) handled by the global `db.session` which is a necessary requirement in order for us to achieve the goal of an atomic unit of work.\r\n\r\nThe one wrinkle with this approach is https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/10819 which explicitly leveraged a `NullPool` (as opposed to `QueuePool`‚Äîif defined via the `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS ` configuration) to avoid using same session across multiple celery workers, however since we're tearing down the session a per task basis where, per [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12044776/how-to-use-flask-sqlalchemy-in-a-celery-task/14146403#14146403), it states,\r\n\r\n> Flask SQLAlchemy will automatically create new sessions for you from scoped session factory, given that we are maintaining the same app context, this ensures tasks have a fresh session (e.g. session errors won't propagate across tasks).\r\n\r\ni.e., we should no longer be experiencing the connection bleeding issue and thus can leverage the efficiency of connection pooling which standardizing the code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26186 (though for Alembic migrations) this PR ensures that the remainder of the codebase (excluding tests and Alembic migrations) leverage the Flask-SQLAlchemy session (`db.session`).\r\n\r\nThis refactor helps to reduce the code complexity and ensures we're not generating any rouge sessions which are often not explicitly closed and can lead to connection
