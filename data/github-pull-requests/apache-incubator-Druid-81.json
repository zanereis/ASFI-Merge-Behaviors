console that leverages system tables via SQL. This console queries both the overlord and the coordinator meaning that is has to run on a node that can route requests to both. In this PR it is expected to run on the router node (part 1) of the proposal. In part (2) this console will also be placed on the coordinator.\r\n\r\nThis console utilises TypeScript and React and is built in such a way as to be maximally simple and maintainable by non web developers while still being slick and powerful.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to consolidate this PR also pulls into itself the legacy consoles. Their functionality is still fully available for anyone to use.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/51812414-40c26100-2266-11e9-804a-c33dcacafb51.png)\r\n\r\nThere is also

https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6714.  Rather than having users download the Kinesis Client Library jar, this change adds the capability to perform deaggregation on Kinesis Producer Library-aggregated messages without the KCL dependency.  These changes were all written without any knowledge of how KCL implements deaggregation.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1) Messages are checked to see if they are aggregations based on whether they have the magic numbers and their checksum is valid (see https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/aggregation-format.md for protobuf schema).  If so, they are deaggregated using the Google protobuf library.  If not, they are processed in the same manner as before.\r\n\r\n2) The deaggregation config value was removed.  The new deaggregation method can handle both aggregated and non-aggregated messages.\r\n\r\n3) A maven step was added to generate a Java file that matches the KPL protobuf schema.\r\n\r\nI know my doc changes were minimal so if anyone has any suggestions about what else to write about, feel free to lmk.","created_at":"2019-01-26T00:14:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T23:42:54Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T22:15:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6d3080fd2e778f01edc49ac567cc8e7a12398cc","assignee":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/63a065666fe24e8943712d4be3eeac9ee21b9462","head":{"label":"justinborromeo:6714-Implement-KCL-Deaggregation","ref":"6714-Implement-KCL-Deaggregation","sha":"63a065666fe24e8943712d4be3eeac9ee21b9462","user":{"login":"justinborromeo","id":9417701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9417701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/justinborromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166004087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYwMDQwODc=","name":"incubator-druid","full_name":"justinborromeo/incubator-druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinborromeo","id":9417701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9417701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/justinborromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinborromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinborromeo/incubator-druid","description":"Apache

to #6443, moves `CompressionUtils.java` of the former `java-util` to the place of `CompressionUtils.java` of the former `druid-api` (since it is marked `@PublicApi`). \r\nThe latter was a wrapper around the former, with the exception of this method:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void gunzip(File pulledFile, File outDir)\t\r\n```\r\nwhich mentioned in it's javadoc:\r\n\r\n>Unlike `org.apache.druid.java.util.common.CompressionUtils.gunzip`, this function takes an\r\n output *DIRECTORY* and tries to guess the file name. It is recommended that the caller use `org.apache.druid.java.util.common.CompressionUtils.gunzip` and specify the output file themselves to ensure names are as expected\r\n\r\nI don't think it's likely a big deal, as far as I can tell this method has been marked deprecated since before `druid-api` was moved into the main repo (over 3 years ago), but we should probably call out in release notes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `makeEvilZip`, which sounds way too scary to be in the core library and was only used by tests has been moved out of `CompressionUtils` and into `CompressionUtilsTest`. `druid-hadoop-indexing` was also using this method, so it now includes a test reference to `druid-core` for test jar.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is showing up in github as deleting the `java-util` version instead of moving it to the previously same named files location, but the only change to the `java-util` version is the addition of `@PublicApi` and moving the `makeEvilZip` to the test. \r\n\r\nI would like to move the other assortment of `*Utils.java` classes scattered around `druid-core` to `org.apache.druid.utils` package as well, but thought it conservative to split this out first since it's not _totally_ cosmetic.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-24T11:15:54Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T21:52:38Z","closed_at":"2019-03-13T15:02:45Z","merged_at":"2019-03-13T15:02:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"3895914aa2ad6eb69b547ab2b8ee1206e52d6b4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/30/labels","id":4033477,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDAzMzQ3Nw==","number":30,"title":"0.15.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":279,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-02-05T23:16:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T22:40:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-07-04T01:16:31Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/54e4726fb7907007cd765594ac2a501706573d81","head":{"label":"clintropolis:one-true-compressionutils","ref":"one-true-compressionutils","sha":"54e4726fb7907007cd765594ac2a501706573d81","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122282812,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIyODI4MTI=","name":"druid","full_name":"clintropolis/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis/druid","description":"Column

PR introduces a published segments cache on broker, as proposed in #6834 . This implements the \"phase 1\" of the proposal. Added a new class `MetadataSegmentView` which polls coordinator periodically to get published segments and maintains a synced copy of same in cache. Another change is to use `DataSegmentInterner#INTERNER` while storing `DataSegment` object  in `ServerSelector` and `MetadataSegmentView` in order reuse the reference for overlapping segments.\r\n\r\nTesting on our test cluster shows sub-second execution time for `sys.segments` queries which were taking multiple seconds without this patch.\r\n\r\nThis feature is optional, it is turned off by default. It can be turned on by adding this config to broker `druid.sql.planner.metadataSegmentCacheEnable=true`. To get better sys tables query performance, it should be turned on.\r\n\r\nAdding some memory comparison charts with and without the patch to compare broker heap, gc activity etc. These are one day's compares with more than 67K segments in our test cluster. Grey is without patch and blue line is with this patch. We can see that this patch causes slightly more used memory and higher GC activity, which is expected as it's collecting published segments from coordinator and as `DataSegment` objects are deserialized in broker and destroyed, so more GC activity is caused, but the overall used memory in broker heap is not much bigger than before.\r\n<img width=\"1066\" alt=\"broker-used-heap\"

maps (i. e. `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ConcurrentSkipListMap`) should be assigned into variables of their respective type or `ConcurrentMap`, but not just `Map`.\r\n\r\nWhy this is important could be seen in `CoordinatorRuleManager`, where it's pretty obvious that code\r\n```java\r\nConcurrentMap<String, List<Rule>> theRules = rules.get();\r\nif (theRules.get(dataSource) != null) {\r\n  retVal.addAll(theRules.get(dataSource));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhas a race condition, but previously when the type of the variable was `Map` it was not obvious.\r\n\r\nThis race condition in `CoordinatorRuleManager` is fixed in this PR. Also, improved logic in `DirectDruidClient` and `ResourcePool`.","created_at":"2019-01-22T05:54:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T02:57:20Z","closed_at":"2019-02-04T17:18:13Z","merged_at":"2019-02-04T17:18:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e926e865276f892ddc5b62685d331b822104022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1169814386,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTY5ODE0Mzg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Automation/Static%20Analysis","name":"Area

GRANT SQL command in the Mysql Metadata Store setup section (http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/mysql.html) does not work with MySQL v8+ due to changes in the GRANT syntax.  Specifically, the ability to create a user with GRANT and the IDENTIFIED BY keywords was removed.  Running the command in the MySQL v8.0.13 shell resulted in the following output:\r\n\r\nGRANT ALL ON druid.* TO 'druid'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'diurd';\r\n> ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'IDENTIFIED BY 'diurd'' at line 1\r\n\r\nThis doc change breaks the command into two separate commands: CREATE USER and GRANT.

filed in [druid-io.github.io](https://github.com/druid-io/druid-io.github.io/issues/558)\r\n\r\nOn this page in the documentation for the PostgreSQL Metadata Store (http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/postgresql.html), the settings table at the bottom uses incorrect properties that do not work in the latest (0.13.0-incubating) version of Druid.\r\n\r\nAccording to the code here [(PostgreSQLMetadataStorageModule.java)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/0.13.0-incubating/extensions-core/postgresql-metadata-storage/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/metadata/storage/postgresql/PostgreSQLMetadataStorageModule.java), the SSL related settings are all prefixed with `druid.metadata.postgres.ssl` NOT `druid.metadata.postgres` as indicated on this documentation page.  For example, you would enable SSL for PostgreSQL using the something like the following in runtime.properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n# ALL THESE PROPERTIES ARE PREFIXED with \"druid.metadata.postgres.ssl\"\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.ssl.enableSSL=true\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.ssl.sslMode=verify-full\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.ssl.sslRootCert=<path-to-ca.crt>\r\n...\r\n```\r\ninstead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n# NONE OF THESE ARE READ BY THE POSTGRES METADATA STORAGE EXTENSION\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.enableSSL=true\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.sslMode=verify-full\r\ndruid.metadata.postgres.sslRootCert=<path-to-ca.crt>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have updated the options to reflect the updated logic in the code.

represents a single partition in a timeChunk. It's basically same with other shardSpecs with total number of partitions = 1 without details of the partition scheme. I think we're using it because mergeTask is able to merge segments only if they have `NoneShardSpec` (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/3241). However, now, we have a compactionTask which can merge any segments.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to deprecate `NoneShardSpec`. Also, I moved all `ShardSpec` implementations to `druid-core`. Other changes are:\r\n\r\n- All task types no long use `NoneShardSpec`. Realtime tasks use `NumberedShardSpec`. Batch tasks can use `NumberedShardSpec`, `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` or `SingleDimensionShardSpec`. \r\n- IndexTask doesn't support `forceExtendableShardSpecs` anymore. The way it worked is, when `forceGuaranteedRollup` = true and `forceExtendableShardSpecs` = false, `NoneShardSpec` was used for a single partition while `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` was used for others. This is inconsistent because `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` is extendable but `NoneShardSpec` is not. If `forceExtendableShardSpecs` is set, `NumberedShardSpec` is used when publishing segments. Now, IndexTask only uses either `NumberedShardSpec` or `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec`. Both of them are extendable, so there's no point for `forceExtendableShardSpecs`.\r\n- HadoopIndexTask still supports `forceExtendableShardSpecs`. It can be set to use `NumberedShardSpec` for range partitioned segments.\r\n\r\nThis is an incompatible change since mergeTask cannot be used for new segments.","created_at":"2019-01-17T22:51:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T06:29:27Z","closed_at":"2019-03-16T06:29:26Z","merged_at":"2019-03-16T06:29:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"892d1d35d6cc00487d583f05f1cc138782180ef9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

legacy druid HLL module assumes the buffers are dense when doing a fold operation. This is not always the case and can lead to a BufferOverfloException. This PR checks to see if any densification needs to happen.\r\n\r\nWe had an upstream data producer who was sampling data. The sampling algorithm seemed to be based on Murmur3_128, or at least a related algorithm where the hash collisions were similar. When doing a HLL sketch of the dimension values, we were getting really weird results where all the HLL buckets would end up with values that were not good sketches of the input data (every bucket nibble with a `1` for example). `testCanFillUpOnMod` demonstrates such a scenario.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate side effect of this was that the folding operation can easily cause corrupt buffers if the buffer folding in is sparse. `testRegisterSwapWithSparse` will fail against master at `folded.toByteBuffer()` similar to how the jackson serialization of the collector fails on historicals in the error mode we found. \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.nio.BufferOverflowException\r\n\tat java.nio.Buffer.nextPutIndex(Buffer.java:527)\r\n\tat java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.putShort(HeapByteBuffer.java:321)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.hll.HyperLogLogCollector.toByteBuffer(HyperLogLogCollector.java:488)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this PR applied, the query result does not crash, but does return as sketch that is

PR introduces an additional lifecycle stage, `Lifecycle.Stage.INIT` which runs first on startup and last on shutdown. The primary reason for this is to put `Log4jShutterDownerModule` in the `INIT` level to ensure it runs last on shutdown, fixing errors similar to those reported in #5568, which was caused by log4j shutdown running late, but not last, with `LoggingEmitter`, `DiscoveryModule`, `Announcer`\r\n`CuratorModule` commonly shutting down after log4j shutdown. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, ties 'task-master' lifecycle to `LifecycleModule` lifecycle in order to gracefully stop being leader when task master is stopping.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a `name` field to `Lifecycle` which helps with additional logging around lifecycle stage startup and stops and which lifecycle they belong to.\r\n\r\non startup:\r\n```\r\n2019-01-15T10:20:20,157 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.java.util.common.lifecycle.Lifecycle -

a cluster gets to sufficient size, it can take a while for the coordinator to finish its segment balancing rules. This PR adds a coordinator dynamic config option to allow a limit to the number of nodes which are considered for targets.

It currently finds like below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final NavigableSet<Interval> dsLockbox = dsRunning.navigableKeySet();\r\n        final Iterable<Interval> searchIntervals = Iterables.concat(\r\n            // Single interval that starts at or before ours\r\n            Collections.singletonList(dsLockbox.floor(new Interval(interval.getStart(), DateTimes.MAX))),\r\n\r\n            // All intervals that start somewhere between our start instant (exclusive) and end instant (exclusive)\r\n            dsLockbox.subSet(\r\n                new Interval(interval.getStart(), DateTimes.MAX),\r\n                false,\r\n                new Interval(interval.getEnd(), interval.getEnd()),\r\n                false\r\n            )\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        return StreamSupport.stream(searchIntervals.spliterator(), false)\r\n                            .filter(searchInterval -> searchInterval != null && searchInterval.overlaps(interval))\r\n                            .flatMap(searchInterval -> dsRunning.get(searchInterval).stream())\r\n                            .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, it's calling `floor()` to find the first entry to start searching. However, `dsRunning` is a `TreeMap` which is initialized with `Comparators.intervalsByStartThenEnd()`. As a result, if there're two or more intervals of the same start but different end, `floor` returns the interval of the greatest end.\r\n\r\nIf this error happens, the overlord prints `Cannot find locks for task[%s] and interval[%s]` or `There are multiple lockPosses for task[%s] and interval[%s]?` in its log.\r\n\r\nTo fix this bug, I changed `running` map to `private final Map<String, NavigableMap<DateTime, SortedMap<Interval, List<TaskLockPosse>>>> running = new HashMap<>();` I also added some codes to get/release `giant` lock. It should be fine without this code, but it's for just in case.

extension is a self-contained new service which tracks the \"watermark\" progression of data through a Druid deployment. The original author was @clintropolis . \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1267\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-01-02 at 3 25 46 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8213081/50620166-ddd1ea00-0eb2-11e9-9149-ddd1ace496fd.png\">\r\n\r\nA \"watermark\" is some indicator for how far along or complete data is in event time. This particular implementation comes with a few interesting ways to be able to monitor when data processing has progressed along certain stages.\r\n\r\n- [x] Watermarks self-contained extension\r\n- [ ] Determine if watermarks should be part of core Druid with extension points\r\n- [x] Docker file for web frontend to api\r\n- [x]  Basic README files\r\n- [ ] Website helper files and examples\r\n- [ ] Fixup tests. They are failing to register the api paths correctly.\r\n\r\nI'll add website friendly files if the community thinks this one would be handy to adopt. I also would like to know if this is handy enough to be in core druid, or if it should just stay as an extension.\r\n\r\n# stable\r\n\r\nThe `stable_*` series of watermarks indicate when data is believed to be contiguous for a set of time. An example of which is when real-time tasks have handed off all segments to historical nodes for a particular series of time.\r\n\r\n# batch\r\n\r\nThe `batch_*` series of watermarks indicate when data has been filled by a batch job. The detector for this watermark series is kind of hacky since it just looks for partition specs which are commonly created from batch jobs.\r\n\r\n# low\r\n\r\nThe `*_low` series of watermarks indicates the lowest *contiguous* timestamp. It will not skip over gaps in data unless manually overridden.\r\n\r\n# high\r\n\r\nthe `*_high` series of watermarks indicates the *furthest along in time* timestamp. So looking in history behind a `*_low` should yield contiguous data until `mintime`, and any split between `*_low` and `*_high` is a good indicator for missing data.\r\n\r\nWe've been using this extension in production for quite a while now and it has worked pretty

is a patch which replaces the `IntIterator` implementation with one that wraps a `BatchIterator` - an iterator which extracts values from the bitmap into a buffer in batches, and can be a lot faster. This relies on a space time tradeoff, so probably requires heuristics or a configurable cardinality threshold to choose when the new kind of iterator is used. These iterators are also more expensive to clone, which seems to be done extensively in druid.\r\n\r\nAt b5df73ebf4598d8d2eff3daf7102a37adaa3abd4 (with batch iterators) I get\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

Druid offers the ability by nested group by query.\r\nIts logic can be described as follows:\r\n\r\nFor a sql like:\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(distinct pid) from DATASOURCE where col=\"val\"\r\n```\r\nthe exactly query will be like:\r\n```sql\r\nselect count(*) from (\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical1 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical2 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  select pid from DATASOURCE_segments_in_historical3 where col=\"val\" group by pid\r\n  ...\r\n) group by pid\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor high cardinality case, the size of result transfered from historical node to broker node can be really large and leads to poor performance.\r\nSo this extension try to use bitmap(64bit RoaringBitmap) as the container for the result data from the historical.\r\nThe performance can be 10 times better the nested group by method.\r\n\r\nWelcome suggestions to this MR.","created_at":"2018-12-21T08:40:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T07:41:29Z","closed_at":"2019-04-15T11:07:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ab3994c30d2b8fb8ac5abc2e5045f896144bd25","assignee":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/c5d332afdf0c8ef24a1d38ef62b0ad5f994c8ec7","head":{"label":"elloooooo:feature_accurate_distinctcount","ref":"feature_accurate_distinctcount","sha":"c5d332afdf0c8ef24a1d38ef62b0ad5f994c8ec7","user":{"login":"elloooooo","id":4433949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4433949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo","html_url":"https://github.com/elloooooo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107643732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDc2NDM3MzI=","name":"druid","full_name":"elloooooo/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elloooooo","id":4433949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4433949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo","html_url":"https://github.com/elloooooo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elloooooo/received

noticed you are investigating using RoaringBitmap 0.7.30. If you do so, it is worth considering a different mechanism to build your bitmaps which favours ordered insertions by buffering them into a container and appending to the bitmap as late as possible (just before the bitmap is queried, or when the next multiple of 2^16 is crossed). There is no need to manually run optimise bitmaps built this way, because they are run optimised at the container level whenever it is appended to the bitmap.\r\n\r\nI am not a druid user and am

currently supports `keepSegmentGranularity`. It's true by default and if it's false, the compactionTask can merge segments across time chunk. This option was introduced for some people who wants the maximal optimization in terms of the segment size, but I think it's not much useful.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I deprecated that option and added a new parameter to set a different segmentGranularity from that of input segments. Also, I added unit tests for verifying that the compactionTask runs as expected.","created_at":"2018-12-19T02:05:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T01:49:41Z","closed_at":"2019-01-04T01:50:46Z","merged_at":"2019-01-04T01:50:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ad6a733a58e81ef2e0dee067b1df8477af1dab4","assignee":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
