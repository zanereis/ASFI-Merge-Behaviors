What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to disallow using binary inequality collation column in the key schema of stateful operator. Worth noting that changing the collation for the same string column during the query restart was already disallowed at the time of introduction of collation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nstate store API is heavily relying on the fact that provider implementation performs O(1)-like get and put operation. While the actual implementation would be dependent on the state store provider, it is intuitive to assume that these providers only do lookup of the key based on binary format (implying binary equality).\r\n\r\nThat said, even though the column spec is case insensitive, state store API wouldn't take this into consideration, and could lead to produce the wrong result. e.g. Determiniing 'a' and 'A' differently while the column is case insensitive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as it wasn't released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-09T07:37:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T04:38:13Z","closed_at":"2024-04-10T04:38:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ee23998b239bd4cad855bfd4efc5a6ed1bec978","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the remaining scalar types defined in the variant spec (DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP_NTZ, FLOAT, BINARY). The current `parse_json` expression doesn't produce these types, but we need them when we support casting a corresponding Spark type into the variant type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR can be considered as a preparation for the cast-to-variant feature and will make the latter PR smaller.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.  Existing variant expressions can decode more variant scalar types.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. We manually construct variant values with these new scalar types and test the existing variant expressions on them.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-09T05:39:23Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T14:51:26Z","closed_at":"2024-04-10T14:51:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa25ea07dc4c6ac04673a32bc0b834a287bea380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ca973ea88117780311a8c92e7b5b224e4dc8d50","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:support_atomic_types","ref":"support_atomic_types","sha":"8ca973ea88117780311a8c92e7b5b224e4dc8d50","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake the critical path like RpcUtils$.askRpcTimeout less fragile\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's observed that our Spark apps occasionally got stuck with an unexpected stack trace when reading/parsing a legitimate time string. Note that we manually killed the stuck app instances and the retry goes thru on the same cluster (without requiring any app code change). For detailed stack traces, please refer to [SPARK-47759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47759). \r\n\r\nUnder the circumstance where a caller can fall back to a default value of a given time unit (e.g., second, ms), we should swallow runtime exceptions triggered by the regex logic and unit conversion, especially for the critical path like RpcUtils$.askRpcTimeout where it might result in a hanging app.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$build/mvn package -DskipTests -Djava.version=17 -pl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `GenerateMIMAIgnore.isPackagePrivateModule` to work correctly.\r\n\r\nFor example, `Metadata` is a case class inside package private `DefaultParamsReader` class. Currently, MIMA fails at this class analysis.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f8e652e88320528a70e605a6a3cf986725e153a5/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/util/ReadWrite.scala#L474-L485\r\n\r\nThe root cause is `isPackagePrivateModule` fails due to `scala.ScalaReflectionException`. We can simply make `isPackagePrivateModule` return `false`  instead of failing.\r\n```\r\nError instrumenting class:org.apache.spark.ml.util.DefaultParamsReader$Metadata\r\nException in thread

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the  CacheLookup relies on the fragment ( sub plan of incoming query)  matching exactly the analyzed Logical Plan in CacheManager for which InMemoryRelation exists.\r\nThis limits efficiency of the lookup.. for eg  \r\nconsider a simple case\r\nwe have an InMemoryRelation available for a plan as\r\n\r\n Project(a, b, c, d)                                                ->  Cached IMR\r\n      |\r\nProject( x as a, b,  b+a as c, b - c as d) \r\n\r\nand the incoming plan is say\r\n  Project( a, b, c)\r\n  |\r\nProject( x as a, b,  b+a as c, b - c as d) \r\n\r\nCurrently the incoming look up will not be able to use Cached IMR, as top level Projects do not match.\r\nBut it is possible to use the IMR by putting a projection of   (a, b c)\r\ni.e Project( a, b, c)\r\n         |\r\n    Cached IMR\r\n\r\nBelow describes how more complex plans can use cache IMR , with filters present in between Projects.\r\n**The main idea is : for each incoming fragment of incoming subplan, check if there is an exact match plan in the cache data. ( this is the current code).  If matches use that, else  look for a partial match ** \r\n\r\n** A partial match, among other requirements, also mandates that incoming_plan.child  is canonically same as cachePlan.child **\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that why only 1  level depth equality is needed, as it is possible that the cache plan is usable even if the child do not match, but grand child match.\r\n\r\n i.e incoming_plan.child.child == cachePlan.child .child\r\nand in that sense the argument can be extended to the leaf..\r\n\r\nSo we limit to 1 child level check for partial match for following reasons:\r\n1) Reduce the complexity \r\n2) Keep lookup time in reasonable limit\r\n3) Hopefully the next PR in line [PR-SPARK-45959](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43854), which aggresively collapses two adjacents Projects or 2 Projects interspersed with Filters, into a single project in analyzer phase, if possible, means that in most cases, the child match would be good enough for partial match requirement..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCase 1: using InMemoryRelation in a plan having 2 consecutive Projects.\r\n\r\nWe start with a DataFrame df1 with plan = Project2 -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as Project2 -> X)\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 =  Some Project -> X \r\nClearly Project may no longer be same as Project2, so a direct check with CacheManager will not result in matching IMR.\r\nBut clearly X are same .\r\nSo the criteria is : an IMR can be used IFF following conditions are met\r\n\r\nX for both is same ( i.e incoming Project's child and CachedPlan's Project's child are same)\r\nAll the NamedExpressions of Incoming Project are expressable in terms of output of Project2 ( which is what IMR's output is )\r\nTo do the check for above point 2, we consider following logic\r\nNow given that X for both are same, which means their outputs are equivalent, so we remap the cached plan's Project2 in terms of output attribute ( Expr IDs) of X of incoming Project Plan\r\nThis will help us find out following\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are directly same as NamedExpressions of Project 2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are some functions of output of Project 2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are sort of Literal Constants and independent of output of Project2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are functions of some attributes but those attributes are unavailable in the output of Project2\r\nSo so long as above # 4 types of NamedExpressions are empty, it means that InMemoryRelation of the CachedPlan is usable.\r\nand this above logic is coded in CacheManager. The logic involves modifying the NamedExpressions in incoming Project, in terms of the Seq[Attributes] which will be forced on the IMR.\r\n\r\nCase 2: using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of Projects interspersed with Filters.\r\n\r\nWe start with a DataFrame df1 with plan = Filter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X )\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = Project -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 -> Filter4  -> X \r\n\r\nClearly here the cached plan chain\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\nis no longer directly similar to\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nBut it is still possible to use IMR as actually the cached plan's LogicalPlan can be used as a subtree of the incoming Plan.\r\n\r\nThe logic for such check is partly the same as above for 2 consecutive Projects, with some handling for filters.\r\nThe algo for this is as follows\r\n\r\nIdentify the \"child\" X from the incoming plan and the Cached Plan 's Logical Plan. for similarity check.\r\nFor incoming Plan, we reach X, and store all the consecutive Filter Chain.\r\nFor the Cached Plan, we identify the first encountered Project , which is Project 2, and its child which is X.\r\n\r\nso we have X from both incoming and cached plan, and we identify the incoming project \"Project\" and the CachedPlan's \"Project2\".\r\nNow we can apply the Rule of case 1 of two consecutive Projects, and correctly modify the NamedExpressions of incoming Project , in terms of Seq[Attributes] which will be enforced upon the IMR.\r\n\r\nBut we also need to ensure that the filter chain present in Cached Plan i.e Filter3 -> Filter4 is a subset of filter chain in the incoming Plan , which is Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4.\r\nNow thing to note is that\r\nfor incoming plan it is\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nIn the above chain, the filters are expressed in terms of output of X\r\nBut for cached plan the filters are expressed in terms of output of Project2.\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\n\r\nSo for comparison we need to express the filter chain of Cached Plan in terms of X, by pulling up the P2 above filters such that\r\nit is now\r\nProject2 -> Filter3' -> Filter4' -> -> X\r\n\r\nNow we can see that if we compare\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n\r\nand find that Filter3' -> Filter4' is a subset of Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4\r\nand as the Project and Project2 are already compatible ( by case point 1)\r\nwe can use cached IMR , with a modified Project with partial filter chain.\r\n\r\ni.e we should be able to get a plan like\r\n\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> IMR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR attempts to make cache look up more robust to make use of existing IMR as much as possible.\r\nAnd this change is a neccessary requirement for another opened PR which collapses projects aggresively

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `schema_of_variant_agg` expression. It returns the merged schema in the SQL format of a variant column. Compared to `schema_of_variant`, which is a scalar expression and returns one schema for one row, the `schema_of_variant_agg` expression merges the schema of all rows.\r\n\r\nUsage examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT schema_of_variant_agg(parse_json(j)) FROM VALUES ('1'), ('2'), ('3') AS tab(j);\r\n BIGINT\r\n> SELECT schema_of_variant_agg(parse_json(j)) FROM VALUES ('{\"a\": 1}'), ('{\"b\": true}'), ('{\"c\": 1.23}') AS tab(j);\r\n STRUCT<a: BIGINT, b: BOOLEAN, c: DECIMAL(3,2)>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis expression can help the user explore the content of variant values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.  A new SQL expression is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for expiring state based on TTL for ListState. Using this functionality, Spark users can specify a TTL Mode for transformWithState operator, and provide a ttlDuration for each value in ListState. TTL support for Map State will be added in future PRs. Once the ttlDuration has expired, the value will not be returned as part of get() and would be cleaned up at the end of the micro-batch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed to support TTL for ListState. The PR supports specifying ttl for processing time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, modifies the ListState interface for specifying ttlDuration\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded the TransformWithListStateTTLSuite, ListStateSuite, StatefulProcessorHandleSuite\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a new trait, `ShuffleCleanupMode` under `QueryExecution`, and two new configs, `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.skipMigration.enabled` and `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.fileCleanup.enabled`.\r\n\r\nFor Spark Connect query executions, `ShuffleCleanupMode` is controlled by the two new configs, and shuffle dependency cleanup are performed accordingly. \r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.fileCleanup.enabled` is `true`, shuffle dependency files will be cleaned up at the end of query executions. \r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.skipMigration.enabled` is `true`, shuffle dependencies will be skipped at the shuffle data migration for node decommissions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to: 1. speed up shuffle data migration at decommissions and 2. possibly (when file cleanup mode is enabled) release disk space occupied by unused shuffle files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This change adds two new configs, `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.skipMigration.enabled` and `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.fileCleanup.enabled` to control the cleanup behaviors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I proposed to add support for reading well-defined ANSI interval types from Oracle databases.\r\n\r\n- NTERVAL YEAR [(year_precision)] TO MONTH\r\n  - Stores a period of time in years and months, where year_precision is the number of digits in the YEAR datetime field. Accepted values are 0 to 9. The default is 2. The size is fixed at 5 bytes.\r\n- INTERVAL DAY [(day_precision)] TO SECOND [(fractional_seconds_precision)]\r\n  - Stores a period of time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, where\r\n    - day_precision is the maximum number of digits in the DAY datetime field. Accepted values are 0 to 9. The default is 2.\r\n    - fractional_seconds_precision is the number of digits in the fractional part of the SECOND field. Accepted values are 0 to 9. The default is 6. The size is fixed at 11 bytes.\r\n\r\nBoth of them are mapped to the defaults of AnsiIntervalTypes.\r\n\r\nWe also add two developer APIs that convert interval strings to underlying representations of YearMonthIntervalType and DaytimeIntervalType. The default implementations assume that the inputs are compatible with the ANSI style, incompatible values will fail to be parsed. However, it shall fail much earlier at the data type mapping step because of undefined mapping rules\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove the Oracle accessibility, as tt's safe to read Oracle external intervals \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, reading Oracle intervals are available now\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause the ResultSetMetadata cannot distinguish a single-dimensional array from multidimensional arrays. Thus, we always read multidimensional arrays as single-dimensional ones, For example, `text[][]` is mapping to `ArrayType(StringType)` and `int[][][]` is `ArrayType(IntegerType)`, this result in errors when converting a ResultSet with multidimensional arrays to InternalRows.\r\n\r\nThis PR supports reading multidimensional arrays from PostgreSQL data sources. To achieve this, the simplest way is to add a new developer API to retrieve it from the information schema of Postgres.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/catalog-pg-attribute.html#CATALOG-PG-ATTRIBUTE\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use functions like `array_dims` to retrieve the dimension of an array column, but it is not easy to inject without causing breaking changes or to determine the dimension based on the actual data.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe have supported writing multidimensional arrays to Postgres, so we shall improve postgres reading abilities too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `pyspark.testing` compatible with `pyspark-connect` by using noop context manager `contextlib.nullcontext` instead of `QuietTest` which requires JVM access.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for `pyspark-connect` to work without classic PySpark packages and dependencies. Also, the logs are hidden as it's written to the separate file so it is actually already quiet.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nYes, at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45870. Once CI is setup there, it will be tested there properly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45885.\r\n\r\nThis PR deflakes the `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream` doctest.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45298 aimed to fix that test but misdiagnosed the root issue. The problem is not that concurrent tests were colliding on a temporary directory. Rather, the issue is specific to the `DataFrame.writeStream` test's logic: that test is starting a streaming query that writes files to the temporary directory, the exits the temp directory context manager without first stopping the streaming query. That creates a race condition where the context manager might be deleting the directory while the streaming query is writing new files into it, leading to the following type of error during cleanup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/__w/spark/spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line ?, in pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream\r\nFailed example:\r\n    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\r\n        # Create a table with Rate source.\r\n        df.writeStream.toTable(\r\n            \"my_table\", checkpointLocation=d)\r\nException raised:\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/doctest.py\", line 1353, in __run\r\n        exec(compile(example.source, filename, \"single\",\r\n      File \"<doctest pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream[3]>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1043, in __exit__\r\n        self.cleanup()\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1047, in cleanup\r\n        self._rmtree(self.name, ignore_errors=self._ignore_cleanup_errors)\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1029, in _rmtree\r\n        _rmtree(name, onerror=onerror)\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/shutil.py\", line 738, in rmtree\r\n        onerror(os.rmdir, path, sys.exc_info())\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/shutil.py\", line 736, in rmtree\r\n        os.rmdir(path, dir_fd=dir_fd)\r\n    OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: '/__w/spark/spark/python/target/4f062b09-213f-4ac2-a10a-2d704990141b/tmp29irqweq'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I update the doctest to properly stop the streaming query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch improves the usability of the progress handler by making sure that an update to the client is sent on every wakeup interval from the server (and not only when a task is finished). The class managing the progress is now usable as a context manager and I've added the progress reporting to more RPC calls to the server.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it adds the operation ID to the progress handler notify message so that the callback can differentiate between multiple concurrent queries.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef progress_handler(stages, inflight_tasks, operation_id):\r\n  print(f\"Operation {operation_id}: {inflight_tasks} inflight tasks\")\r\n\r\nspark.registerProgressHandler(progress_handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsability\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe RocksDBStateEncoder now implements range projection by reading a list of ordering ordinals, and using that to project certain columns, in big-endian, to the front of the `Array[Byte]` encoded rows returned by the encoder.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nStateV2 implementations (and other state-related operators) project certain columns to the front of `UnsafeRow`s, and then rely on the RocksDBStateEncoder to range-encode those columns. We can avoid the initial projection by just passing the RocksDBStateEncoder the ordinals to encode at the front. This should avoid any GC or codegen overheads associated with projection.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs. All existing UTs should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-06T00:08:20Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T08:39:23Z","closed_at":"2024-04-08T08:39:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cc37b69c4156ea50de18d4ea6b8723c506e9da7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMigrate logWarning with variables of the Catalyst module to structured logging framework. This transforms the logWarning entries of the following API\r\n```\r\ndef logWarning(msg: => String): Unit\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ndef logWarning(entry: LogEntry): Unit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, Spark core logs will contain additional MDC\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCompiler and scala style checks, as well as code review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-04-05T23:31:41Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T17:41:15Z","closed_at":"2024-04-09T05:56:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7df54b99403bc266ffa25967fe2178e88106ab3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f5fb4fd2efb5294f9347b9f03f65eecad6c1a054","head":{"label":"dtenedor:log-warn-catalyst","ref":"log-warn-catalyst","sha":"f5fb4fd2efb5294f9347b9f03f65eecad6c1a054","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen we try to add some expressions to equivalent expressions it fail\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions.DslExpression\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.{EquivalentExpressions, If, Literal}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col\r\n\r\nval one = Literal(1.0)\r\nval y = col(\"y\").expr\r\nval e1 = If(\r\n  Literal(true),\r\n  y * one * one + one * one * y,\r\n  y * one * one + one * one * y\r\n)\r\n(new EquivalentExpressions).addExprTree(e1)\r\n\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot update expression: (1.0 * 1.0) in map: Map(ExpressionEquals(('y * 1.0)) -> ExpressionStats(('y * 1.0))) with use count: -1\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.EquivalentExpressions.updateExprInMap(EquivalentExpressions.scala:85)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.EquivalentExpressions.updateExprTree(EquivalentExpressions.scala:198)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.EquivalentExpressions.$anonfun$updateExprTree$1(EquivalentExpressions.scala:200)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.EquivalentExpressions.$anonfun$updateExprTree$1$adapted(EquivalentExpressions.scala:200)\r\n  at scala.collection.Iterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:943)\r\n  at scala.collection.Iterator.foreach$(Iterator.scala:943)\r\n  at scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1431)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main problem is when updateExprTree is used with useCount = 1 it iterates through the children of an expression in a certain order. When in updateExprInMap an equivalent (but not equal) expression is found, it does not iterate over its children. Therefore to be able to perform the inverse operation (useCount = -1) it is necessary to traverse the children in inverse order how they were added because the children of two equivalent expressions are not necessarily equal, as the example that we have `(y + 1) + 1` is equivalent to `(1 + 1) + y` but `(y + 1)` is not equal to `(1 + 1)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix an issue with some type of expressions\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR deflakes the `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream` doctest.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45298 aimed to fix that test but misdiagnosed the root issue. The problem is not that concurrent tests were colliding on a temporary directory. Rather, the issue is specific to the `DataFrame.writeStream` test's logic: that test is starting a streaming query that writes files to the temporary directory, the exits the temp directory context manager without first stopping the streaming query. That creates a race condition where the context manager might be deleting the directory while the streaming query is writing new files into it, leading to the following type of error during cleanup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/__w/spark/spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line ?, in pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream\r\nFailed example:\r\n    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\r\n        # Create a table with Rate source.\r\n        df.writeStream.toTable(\r\n            \"my_table\", checkpointLocation=d)\r\nException raised:\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/doctest.py\", line 1353, in __run\r\n        exec(compile(example.source, filename, \"single\",\r\n      File \"<doctest pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame.writeStream[3]>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1043, in __exit__\r\n        self.cleanup()\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1047, in cleanup\r\n        self._rmtree(self.name, ignore_errors=self._ignore_cleanup_errors)\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/tempfile.py\", line 1029, in _rmtree\r\n        _rmtree(name, onerror=onerror)\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/shutil.py\", line 738, in rmtree\r\n        onerror(os.rmdir, path, sys.exc_info())\r\n      File \"/usr/lib/python3.11/shutil.py\", line 736, in rmtree\r\n        os.rmdir(path, dir_fd=dir_fd)\r\n    OSError: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: '/__w/spark/spark/python/target/4f062b09-213f-4ac2-a10a-2d704990141b/tmp29irqweq'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I update the doctest to properly stop the streaming query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.

co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-05T00:03:05Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T18:28:25Z","closed_at":"2024-04-05T02:14:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4683d05d2063de8037a63601070db99bd42430e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/960208539526a8451d672ec85c7a15dd039c6b6f","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fix-flaky-writestream-doctest","ref":"fix-flaky-writestream-doctest","sha":"960208539526a8451d672ec85c7a15dd039c6b6f","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357, #36889, #38209, #39755, #41120, #42684 and #44315.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-04T23:49:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T00:21:52Z","closed_at":"2024-07-15T00:21:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"187a0bbc82f9a0c030a9b4ac9a09fb4a847b8371","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c37fed4d2596bb1201cc7b1a06790ffd0a4dd99d","head":{"label":"robert3005:rk/lazy-registries","ref":"rk/lazy-registries","sha":"c37fed4d2596bb1201cc7b1a06790ffd0a4dd99d","user":{"login":"robert3005","id":512084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005","html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47656892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzY1Njg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"robert3005/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robert3005","id":512084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005","html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a race condition between the maintenance thread and task thread when change-log checkpointing is enabled, and ensure all snapshots are valid.\r\n\r\n1. The maintenance thread currently relies on class variable lastSnapshot to find the latest checkpoint and uploads it to DFS. This checkpoint can be modified at commit time by Task thread if a new snapshot is created.\r\n2. The task thread was not resetting the lastSnapshot at load time, which can result in newer snapshots (if a old version is loaded) being considered valid and uploaded to DFS. This results in VersionIdMismatch errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese are logical bugs which can cause `VersionIdMismatch` errors causing user to discard the snapshot and restart the query. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test cases. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to get the proper default port for `pyspark-connect` testcases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`pyspark-connect` cannot access to the JVM, so cannot get the randomized port assigned from JVM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, `pyspark-connect` is not published yet, and this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-04T07:25:45Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T14:33:28Z","closed_at":"2024-04-04T14:33:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e1ffaef6095b034749b327b9b379c8f73311e66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45875/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45875/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45875/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03df6dac25be51e06f8e5c4264b267e17419cdca","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-47729","ref":"SPARK-47729","sha":"03df6dac25be51e06f8e5c4264b267e17419cdca","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make SparkConf to root level to for both `SparkSession` and `SparkContext`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`SparkConf` is special. `SparkSession.builder.options` can take it as an option, and this instance can be created without JVM access. So it can be shared with pure Python `pysaprk-connect` package.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should
