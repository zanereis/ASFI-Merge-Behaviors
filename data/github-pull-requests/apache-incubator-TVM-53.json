`floordiv(floormod(x * 360, 16) + 359, 16)` with x in [0, 2) can finally reduce to constant `22`, since the rule could eliminate the multiply factor `360` to `360 % 16`, activating more available

Optional specify block by name, rather than needing a separate call to `Schedule.get_block`.\r\n* Enable `*args` in the index mapping function.\r\n* Allow `AXIS_SEPARATOR` in the index mapping

adds `/opt/sccache` to the PATH of each of the CI docker images so when cmake looks for a C compiler it will pick up the sccache wrapper by default.

goal of this PR is to allow `IndexMap` to express transformations that introduce padding in the transformed shape.  For an arbitrary input shape, the new method `IndexMap.non_surjective_inverse` determines the inverse transformation, along with a predicate specifying which coordinates in the transformed index space do not contain an inverse in the original index space.  The previous behavior of `IndexMap.inverse`, requiring transformations to be bijective over the range given, is maintained.\r\n\r\nThis functionality will be used in the future to allow buffer transformations (see #9727 and #10538) to introduce padding to the buffer.","created_at":"2022-05-06T21:12:57Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T19:54:28Z","closed_at":"2022-05-13T18:36:50Z","merged_at":"2022-05-13T18:36:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e8107bfc7740015a96e44b98950e536de54866d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"spectrometerHBH","id":32121147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32121147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH","html_url":"https://github.com/spectrometerHBH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7708d9eee37b4067d41dc01f0c2309483f200aad","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:padded_index_mapping","ref":"padded_index_mapping","sha":"7708d9eee37b4067d41dc01f0c2309483f200aad","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR is an attempt to revive [PR#9164](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9164) . It enables folding of constants for QNN operations. Motivation to have this feature is BYOC use cases. For some BYOC it can help to avoid weights converting at runtime and thus to improve performance.\r\n\r\nOne important thing: for the case when we call `FoldConstant` before `FakeQuantizationToInteger` pass, we can prevent `FQ2I` from converting some ops to qnn equivalent. To avoid this, folding of QNN constants is disabled by default. To enable use fold_qnn=True flag in `FoldConstant` pass.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alexander Peskov

is a latent bug in the CMSIS-NN demo app where the input and output tensors generated by the `create_image.py` script are not 16-byte aligned in memory. Although this does not cause an issue in the demo using the current `person_detect` model, if a different model is substituted with a larger output tensor, it causes the FVP to hang in certain

PR is an attempt to revive [PR#9164](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9164) . It enables folding of constants for QNN operations. Motivation to have this feature is BYOC use cases.\r\n\r\nOne important thing: for the case when we call `FoldConstant` before `FakeQuantizationToInteger` pass, we can prevent FQ2I from converting some ops to qnn equivalent. To avoid this, callback argument was added in `FoldConstant` pass that allows to skip expressions from folding.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alexander Peskov

I can now do so elegantly as follows:\r\n```\r\nshape_dict = {'data': [1, 3, 224, 224]}\r\nmodel_bs1 = tvmc.load('my_model.onnx', shape_dict=shape_dict)\r\ntvmc.tune(model, log_file='batch_1.logs')\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'data': [4, 3, 224, 224]}\r\nmodel_bs4 = tvmc.load('my_model.onnx', shape_dict=shape_dict)\r\ntvmc.tune(model, log_file='batch_4.logs')\r\n\r\n# Create dispatcher for multiple batch sizes.\r\nflex_mod = relay.transform.FlexibleShapeDispatch(buckets=[1, 4])(model_bs1.mod)\r\n\r\nwith ApplyHistoryBest(['batch_1.logs', 'batch_4.logs']):\r\n    exe = relay.vm.compile(flex_mod, \"llvm\")\r\n\r\n# Now we can run inputs with either batch 1 or batch 4 and get the tuned performance!\r\nbatch_1 = np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224).astype(\"float32\")\r\nvm.benchmark(tvm.cpu(), batch_2, func_name=\"main\")\r\n\r\nbatch_4 = np.random.rand(4, 3, 224, 224).astype(\"float32\")\r\nvm.benchmark(tvm.cpu(), batch_4, func_name=\"main\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs seen above `FlexibleShapeDispatch` is a simple halfway point between fully static and fully dynamic graphs that allows us to leverage TVM tuning. If an input shape is not provided in `buckets`, it will either run fully dynamically using `relay.Any`, or if the `auto_pad` argument is set for `FlexibleShapeDispatch`, padding will be applied to match the closest bucket.\r\n\r\nThere are a few special cases that this pass handles. Multiple dynamic inputs (like those you might see in BERT) can be handled by setting `input_indices` to indicate which inputs have a dynamic axis. `affects_output` can be set to `False` for cases where the output shape is not dependent on input dynamism which could occur in dynamic resolution cases or something.\r\n\r\nTo make applying tuning logs more convenient, I also added the ability to load and merge multiple files to both autotvm and autoscheduler.\r\n\r\nThanks @jroesch for providing the backbone of this implementation.","created_at":"2022-05-03T02:28:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:06Z","closed_at":"2022-05-06T19:18:16Z","merged_at":"2022-05-06T19:18:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"98aa41e329c20a5b8b34a34387fcc9067db5f22a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/936a6befd72c2eeac4415d5469e882afea129e2c","head":{"label":"jwfromm:flexible_shape_pass","ref":"flexible_shape_pass","sha":"936a6befd72c2eeac4415d5469e882afea129e2c","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

we encounter some weird problem on llvm generated codes, seems caused by current llvm tbaa annotations.\r\n\r\nThe function `AddAliasInfo` will distinguish the index of scalar form and vectorized form. If we pass a scalar index but actually it is just the head of a ramp access, there is a possibility that overlapped accesses are infered as `NoAlias` by tbaa analysis unsafely.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure how to reproduce the problem on common target like X86 cpu. Glad to see any suggestions:)\r\ncc @Lunderberg
