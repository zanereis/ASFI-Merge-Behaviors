issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

The rnn operator produces zero gradients for bias when num_layers > 1. It is caused by a mistake in calculating the shift of bias pointer, where we used the size of fusion bias (i2h_bias + h2h_bias) but MXNet gives twice (i2h_bias, h2h_bias) as many as the fusion size.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Use the correct shift of bias pointer.\r\n- [x] Change the way of sharing the same values of parameters of the fused RNN layers and the stacked one.\r\n- [x] Add check for RNN output states.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAs title. together with some minor style fixes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] FFI for sum, std, var\r\n- [x] Change to outer's wrapper to avoid extra copying\r\n- [x] Performance benchmark\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nImplement Numpy operator rollaxis\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumpy Operator | Old FFI (ctypes) (us) | New FFI (cython)

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-16T09:30:51Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T18:37:30Z","closed_at":"2020-03-18T18:37:30Z","merged_at":"2020-03-18T18:37:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea2320a897bdadfe0127e487f7ac776a3667e771","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/298c019136e514dfb1c273059fb81e2fcf64a5f3","head":{"label":"DwwWxx:FFI_for_np_argmax_np_argmin_np_indices","ref":"FFI_for_np_argmax_np_argmin_np_indices","sha":"298c019136e514dfb1c273059fb81e2fcf64a5f3","user":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224129560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjk1NjA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is the implementation for proposal #17269\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nThe major components of this PR is:\r\n- c++ threaded dataloader with native support from the following datasets/batchify_functions\r\n- c++ native support for datasets covering `gluon.data.datasets` and `gluon.data.vision.datasets`\r\n- c++ batchify functions including `Stack`, `Pad`, `Groups`\r\n- Gluon version of transforms that can apply data augmentations to image/bboxes\r\n- Gluon version of data iterator substitutes of `mx.image.ImageIter` and `mx.image.ImageDetIter` for simplest interface for loading image classification and object detection datsets.\r\n\r\n### Code Review ###\r\nSince this PR involves lots of backend and frontend changes and can not be easily divided into multiple PRs, so I would like to suggest modular code reviews:\r\n\r\n| Modules | notes | suggested reviewers | \r\n| ------------| -------- | --------------------------- |\r\n| include/mxnet/c_api.h/cc,

Description ##\r\n[numpy] add new ffi for column_stack and hstack\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-14T06:10:42Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T02:05:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T02:05:51Z","merged_at":"2020-04-16T02:05:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"94f235d5385773ce8a4f21957d9946deed15b7f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5d730333d7d18d4e93080a96080d199aea7b256a","head":{"label":"vexilligera:colstk_ffi","ref":"colstk_ffi","sha":"5d730333d7d18d4e93080a96080d199aea7b256a","user":{"login":"vexilligera","id":20215432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE1NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20215432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera","html_url":"https://github.com/vexilligera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241001829,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDEwMDE4Mjk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"vexilligera/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vexilligera","id":20215432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE1NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20215432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera","html_url":"https://github.com/vexilligera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vexilligera/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the slice operator export from MXNet into ONNX.\r\n\r\n@MoritzMaxeiner reported this problem already: **Incorrect ONNX export of SliceChannel** https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13061.\r\nThe corresponding pull request **ONNX export: Support equal length splits** https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14121 however, only partially solved the problem.\r\n\r\nThe output of the slice operator was corrected but it is still not properly handled in the `get_inputs()` function.\r\n\r\nThe following unit test demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass SplitConcatBlock(HybridBlock):\r\n    \"\"\"Block which creates two splits and later concatenates them\"\"\"\r\n    def __init__(self, name):\r\n        super(SplitConcatBlock, self).__init__(name)\r\n\r\n    def hybrid_forward(self, F, x):\r\n        splits = F.split(x, axis=1, num_outputs=2)\r\n        return F.concat(*splits)\r\n\r\ndef test_onnx_export_slice(self):\r\n     net = nn.HybridSequential(prefix='slice_net')\r\n     with net.name_scope():\r\n         net.add(nn.Dense(100, activation='relu'), SplitConcatBlock(\"splitConcat\"), nn.Dense(10))\r\n     _check_onnx_export(net)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the conversion of the model from MXNet into ONNX resulted in the following error:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mxnet_export_test.py\", line 134, in test_onnx_export_slice\r\n    _check_onnx_export(net)\r\n  File \"mxnet_export_test.py\",

\"slice_netsplitConcatconcat0\" op_type: \"Concat\" attribute { name: \"axis\" i: 1 type: INT }\r\n is not output of any previous nodes.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is resolved by replacing:\r\n```python\r\n        input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].name)\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```python\r\n        try:\r\n            # ip[1] defines which output index to use\r\n            input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].output[ip[1]])\r\n        except AttributeError:\r\n            # fallback to the name attribute as output if the output attribute does not exist (e.g. for data nodes)\r\n            input_nodes.append(proc_nodes[input_node_id].name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPing: @Roshrini @vandanavk @ChaiBapchya\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free

Description ##\r\nAs np.random.gamma adopts `scale` uses the scale parameterization, a chi2 distribution with `df=k` is equivalent to Gamma(k/2, 2) instead of Gamma(k/2, 1/2)\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-13T09:02:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-15T05:38:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-15T05:38:01Z","merged_at":"2020-03-15T05:38:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"d495f228eb6ef5ba144edbe160425da74e27b497","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/51d24df7968dd6fc544fc9eea3d21b331792439d","head":{"label":"xidulu:chi2_fix","ref":"chi2_fix","sha":"51d24df7968dd6fc544fc9eea3d21b331792439d","user":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195962165,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU5NjIxNjU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xidulu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFFI for np_where\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge,

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nadd magic methods\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nFix #17792 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Fix `npx.softmax` on zero-sized inputs\r\n- [ ] Extra unit tests for 0-sized inputs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-09T21:50:53Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T17:53:08Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T21:24:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc8b52e5ea408e108ba9d03ea2f1dc19f56e20a8","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ccb1a0a21d99027ba9f19b00803919575a84db99","head":{"label":"haojin2:softmax_0_size","ref":"softmax_0_size","sha":"ccb1a0a21d99027ba9f19b00803919575a84db99","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-09T17:40:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T06:40:05Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T06:39:54Z","merged_at":"2020-04-07T06:39:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"002d4f1d91aac28d28d3147ddd6479c4e7dce016","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17795/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17795/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17795/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c767ebb1d31ec63d4e01464dbce7725a67b943b0","head":{"label":"DwwWxx:FFI_linalg_op","ref":"FFI_linalg_op","sha":"c767ebb1d31ec63d4e01464dbce7725a67b943b0","user":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224129560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjk1NjA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DwwWxx","id":46704444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA0NDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46704444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx","html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DwwWxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DwwWxx/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-09T13:30:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T23:58:43Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T23:58:42Z","merged_at":"2020-04-08T23:58:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"178b98e91b136c5186eed11a1bed1480b3595420","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/51c6d777a7f9fd93cc6356a6f3a3ddfc63c40bce","head":{"label":"Tommliu:interp","ref":"interp","sha":"51c6d777a7f9fd93cc6356a6f3a3ddfc63c40bce","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gra

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-09T03:50:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:25:23Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T07:26:33Z","merged_at":"2020-03-24T07:26:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4052fde4a94c8a70f805fe9b44980125afa8686","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/299ae9ce5169fe91da43203749f1865bd3b6caf6","head":{"label":"Tommliu:ffi_diag","ref":"ffi_diag","sha":"299ae9ce5169fe91da43203749f1865bd3b6caf6","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4",

Description ##\r\nThe graph executor seems to be leaked when the graph cannot be recreated from unoptimized symbol.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd a benchmark file to compare ffi performance.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@reminisce

utilized.\r\n\r\nCurrently in MXNet we use vectorized loads and stores only for `half_t` type for a few operators (some elementwise binary operators and elementwise_sum). Unfortunately, the way it was done makes some assumptions about MXNet's NDArrays which do not hold true for all cases.\r\n\r\n - Failure 1:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nctx=mx.gpu()\r\na = mx.nd.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='float16', ctx=ctx)\r\nb = mx.nd.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='float16', ctx=ctx)\r\n\r\nc = a[1:3]\r\nd = b[1:3]\r\nmx.nd.elemwise_add(c, d, out=c)\r\n```\r\nResults in error:\r\n```\r\nCheck failed: e == cudaSuccess: CUDA: misaligned address\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Failure 2:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nctx=mx.gpu()\r\na = mx.nd.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='float16', ctx=ctx)\r\nb = mx.nd.array([1,2,3,4], dtype='float16', ctx=ctx)\r\n\r\nprint(a)\r\nc = a[0:3]\r\nd = b[0:3]\r\nmx.nd.elemwise_add(c, d, out=c)\r\nmx.nd.waitall()\r\nprint(c)\r\nprint(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives:\r\n```\r\n[1. 2. 3. 4.]\r\n<NDArray 4 @gpu(0)>\r\n\r\n[2. 4. 6.]\r\n<NDArray 3 @gpu(0)>\r\n\r\n[2. 4. 6. 8.]\r\n<NDArray 4 @gpu(0)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a silent data corruption (the last element of `a` should not have been changed).\r\n\r\nIt was not noticed before because `a + b` for NDArrays launches the `broadcast_add` instead of `elemwise_add` (and is not vectorized), whereas in the symbolic execution slices give new allocations, which do not exhibit those issues. \r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n - fixes those issues\r\n - introduces helpers for handling vectorization (for all types, not only `half_t`)\r\n - increases performance of vectorized kernels\r\n - introduces vectorization for all binary/unary/binary with scalar ops\r\n - (WIP) introduces vectorization for broadcast ops\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @sxjscience @haojin2 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nAdd random number generator support for custom operator libraries. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Design ###\r\nWe pass from MXNet the initialized and seeded states, located on CPU and GPU, to

Description ##\r\nChanging some parameters in test_loss to reduce the running time of tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete \r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Updated `test_bce_loss_with_pos_weight` and `test_ctc_loss_train`. Reduces the run time of each test from >2 seconds to less than 1.3 seconds locally. Tests pass with multiple seeds (>30).\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- There are multiple opportunities for reducing the running time of tests by tuning some parameters like iterations, learning rate, etc.\r\n- For these changes, I verified that the tests still pass with multiple seeds\r\n- Would you guys be interested in such optimizations? If yes, I can help contribute more and look at optimizing other *more expensive* tests in the test suite. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions or any necessary checks that I should do on these tests.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-04T15:54:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T05:55:56Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc1d87abaabfd962b1ca7a70bfe8a8c7ad29071d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/67e8411598661601c3d1495c6be822cf202c7672","head":{"label":"sleepy-owl:sleepy-owl-patch-1","ref":"sleepy-owl-patch-1","sha":"67e8411598661601c3d1495c6be822cf202c7672","user":{"login":"sleepy-owl","id":61391995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzkxOTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61391995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl","html_url":"https://github.com/sleepy-owl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":244933458,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDQ5MzM0NTg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"sleepy-owl/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sleepy-owl","id":61391995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzkxOTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61391995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl","html_url":"https://github.com/sleepy-owl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleepy-owl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sleepy-owl/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nMinimum, non-breaking change to alleviate #17688 \r\n\r\n`HybridBlock.export()` to return tuple of stored filenames (rather than undefined), to expose this information to user code which would otherwise have to re-implement internal filename selection logic.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] ~The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)~ (No JIRA issue, to my knowledge)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage: (Sort of? See Changes section below...)\r\n- [X] Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- ~Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)~\r\n- ~Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)~\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [X] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- ~For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented.~\r\n- ~For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable~\r\n- ~Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html~\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Implementations for Python and Perl bindings\r\n- Minor Python docstring update to document change\r\n- Unit test for Python, but not for

Description ##\r\nUse new ffi for cumsum and add for better speed. Also two changes to the new ffi infra:\r\n- Enable `out` for new ffi.\r\n- Support op with no parameters, like `add`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@haojin2  @reminisce

Description ##\r\n\r\nMake Gluon `GRUCell` compatible with `LSTMCell` by exposing activation and recurrent activation. Moreover, in [LSTNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015), GRU with `relu` was used that's not possible with current API. Note that LSTNet was recently added to [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/pull/596).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nImplements 3 new node conversion functions, to facilitate the conversion of `gluon.rnn.LSTM` blocks to ONNX. (fixes #15341)\r\n\r\n1) `_zeros` (as well as `_ones` and `_full` as a bonus)\r\n    `gluon.rnn.LSTM` uses `sym.zeros` to [initialize the initial recurrent states](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/10a12d59f67ad21032a94b1721aaf9b96fddac85/python/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_layer.py#L234).\r\n2) `_rnn_param_concat` which is used by mxnet to [concatenate all the flattened parameters](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/10a12d59f67ad21032a94b1721aaf9b96fddac85/python/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_layer.py#L278), before passing them to the `RNN` node.\r\n3) `RNN` which is the backend op for the actual `LSTM` computation.\r\n\r\nI've also implemented/updated a couple helper functions in the [`_op_translations.py`](https://github.com/RuRo/incubator-mxnet/blob/onnx_export_RNN/python/mxnet/contrib/onnx/mx2onnx/_op_translations.py) file in a separate commit to hopefully reduce the boilerplate amount.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Tests ##\r\n\r\nI didn't add any tests for this node yet, since I am not 100% sure, how exactly to do that.\r\nSome other PRs with ONNX exports, just add the new node names to a list in [`tests/python-pytest/onnx/test_cases.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/10a12d59f67ad21032a94b1721aaf9b96fddac85/tests/python-pytest/onnx/test_cases.py#L96), however, I don't see, how would this add any actual tests, without a reference ONNX implementation available.\r\n\r\nI would gladly add some unittests, if someone can point the right direction though. For now, I've verified the correctness of my conversion by\r\n1) Running this script:\r\n\r\n    <details>\r\n    <summary>test_rnn_export_onnx.py</summary>\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    #!/bin/env python3\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import mxnet as mx\r\n    import onnxruntime as rt\r\n\r\n    import logging\r\n    import shutil\r\n    import os\r\n    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Configuration\r\n    path = 'lstm-model'\r\n    seq_len = 10\r\n    batch_size = 32\r\n    input_size = 16\r\n    hidden_size = 8\r\n    bidirectional = True\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Create input data\r\n    shape = (seq_len, batch_size, input_size)\r\n    I = mx.nd.random.randn(*shape)\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Create LSTM network\r\n    seq = mx.gluon.nn.HybridSequential()\r\n    with seq.name_scope():\r\n        seq.add(mx.gluon.rnn.LSTM(hidden_size, bidirectional=bidirectional))\r\n    seq.initialize()\r\n    seq(I)\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Init all parameters with random values\r\n    for k, p in seq.collect_params().items():\r\n        p.data()[...] = np.random.randn(*p.data().shape)\r\n    seq.hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_shape=True)\r\n    res_mx = seq(I)\r\n    res_mx = res_mx.asnumpy()\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Export to symbol and then to ONNX and forward with onnxruntime\r\n    seq.export(path)\r\n    mx.contrib.onnx.export_model(\r\n        f'{path}-symbol.json',\r\n        f'{path}-0000.params',\r\n        [shape], np.float32,\r\n        onnx_file_path=f'{path}.onnx',\r\n        verbose=True\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Forward, using onnxruntime\r\n    sess = rt.InferenceSession(f'{path}.onnx')\r\n    res_onnx, = sess.run(None, {'data': I.asnumpy()})\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Check results\r\n    diff = np.abs(res_mx - res_onnx)\r\n    print(f\"{diff.mean()=}\")\r\n    print(f\"{diff.max()=}\")\r\n    np.testing.assert_almost_equal(res_mx, res_onnx, decimal=4)\r\n    # decimal=4 is the same as mxnet unittests for other ONNX ops\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Clean up files\r\n    os.remove(f\"{path}-symbol.json\")\r\n    os.remove(f\"{path}-0000.params\")\r\n    os.remove(f\"{path}.onnx\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n    Which generates a model with an `LSTM` node, fills all the parameters with random data, exports it to a `symbol.json` and `0000.params` and then converts the model to `ONNX`. It then loads the model using `onnxruntime` and forwards some random data through both the `mxnet` as well as the `onnx` models and asserts, that the results are close.\r\n\r\n2) Using this conversion on a CRNN network, I trained at my job and verifying that the prediction results are the same on a subset of out test set. (unfortunately, I can't give too much details about this model, so you'll have to trust me here)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThere are a few details in my current implementation that should be noted:\r\n1) `_zeros`\r\n    - It seems, that `mx.sym` can broadcast a `_zeros`/`_ones`/`_full` node along an axis with dimension 0 as if it were a 1, while `ONNX` can't do that.\r\n        ```python\r\n        import mxnet as mx\r\n        a = mx.sym.zeros((10, 0, 30))\r\n        b = mx.sym.Variable('b')\r\n        (a * b).eval(b=mx.nd.zeros((10, 20, 30)))[0].shape\r\n        ```\r\n        Currently, my implementation converts all the 0 dims to 1s. Is this correct?\r\n    - The version of `ONNX`, that mxnet uses doesn't support some newer nodes like `ConstantOfShape` and I was not able to find a working onnx implementation, which actually supported the currently deprecated `ConstantFill` op, so I had to actually store the `_zeros` data in a tensor, which ends up being stored in the onnx model file.<br/>\r\n    This also applies to the helper funtions and the other nodes. I've had to settle for some \"less than elegant\" solutions in some cases, because of the lacking opset support. I might have also missed a better way to do some operations, so if you have any better alternatives, I would gladly change my implementation.<br/>\r\n\r\n2) `_rnn_param_concat`\r\n    You can read more about my implementation in the code (comments), but the general outline is that since `ONNX` expects the `RNN` parameters prepared in a completely different way compared to mxnet, I've had to employ some \"dark\" magic, involving `convert_rnn_param_concat` generating multiple nodes and `convert_RNN` 'guessing' these node names, using regular expressions.<br/>\r\n    As a result, the current conversion mechanism only works, if the parameters of the RNN block are concatenated using `_rnn_param_concat` (and not for example `Concat`). If the conversion of of `mx.sym.RNN` (without `gluon`) is a widely requested feature, we would have to convert the `_rnn_param_concat` node to a regular `Concat`, and then split the parameters back apart in the `RNN` conversion, which is not very nice IMO.<br/>\r\n\r\n3) `RNN`\r\n    Even though, this PR implements the conversion of the `RNN` node, currently only the `LSTM` mode is supported and many of the \"customization\" options are also not implemented.\r\n    **Implemented:**\r\n    - `mode=LSTM`\r\n    - `layout='TNC'`\r\n    - `bidirectional=True` and `False`\r\n    \r\n    **Not Implemented**, but probably supported by ONNX (easy to implement):\r\n    - `mode=GRU, RNN_relu, RNN_tanh` (via GRU and RNN ONNX nodes and the `activations` attribute)\r\n    - `use_sequence_length` (via ONNX `sequence_lens` optional input)\r\n    - custom `states` inputs and `states` outputs (input states might already work, output states - via 'Y_h' and 'Y_c' optional outputs)\r\n    - custom `layout != TNC` (need `SwapAxis` op conversion)\r\n    \r\n    **Not Implemented**, and probably **not** supported by ONNX (hard to implement):\r\n    - `dropout` (the `p` input in ONNX is `peephole`, *not* dropout probability)\r\n    - `state_clip_min` and `state_clip_max` (the `clip` attribute in ONNX seems to produce different results than `state_clip_min`/`max`)\r\n    - `state_clip_nan`\r\n    - `projection_size`\r\n    - `num_layers`","created_at":"2020-03-01T20:55:40Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T00:16:32Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T18:56:07Z","merged_at":"2020-06-19T18:56:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"041bd3016375c6bdadddc9e9f43655923ee739bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudhacharya","id":2778341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2778341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudhacharya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudhacharya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Roshrini","id":8004078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDQwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8004078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini","html_url":"https://github.com/Roshrini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Roshrini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFix warnings introduced in #17510, as is mentioned in #17708\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\nThank @leezu for help.","created_at":"2020-02-28T08:36:30Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T20:04:09Z","closed_at":"2020-02-28T18:20:05Z","merged_at":"2020-02-28T18:20:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f5cd92711c0a51e6355ab100902033da7e45d53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b4af199c06cf36e50510ae2d87f2f9a42f8d77e8","head":{"label":"hzfan:fix-ffi-warning_pr","ref":"fix-ffi-warning_pr","sha":"b4af199c06cf36e50510ae2d87f2f9a42f8d77e8","user":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192095733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIwOTU3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hzfan/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site

Description ##\r\nChange Operator Registration of Bincount to FFI\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-28T04:39:44Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T22:02:48Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T22:02:01Z","merged_at":"2020-03-10T22:02:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"713d962359cfe5b014ca24c0f9b3676d86b28569","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3d8b7367d1fb2eceb6d538dc21b5ac447ada3a6f","head":{"label":"Tommliu:ffi_bincount","ref":"ffi_bincount","sha":"3d8b7367d1fb2eceb6d538dc21b5ac447ada3a6f","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/403829

Description ##\r\nIn the ONNX model zoo, we noticed that models like ArcFace and DUC that have been exported from mxnet with batchnorm operators are not treating spatial mode correctly. Without this PR, this model export pipeline is broken.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/models/issues/156\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/models/issues/91#issuecomment-540312125\r\n\r\ncc: @ankkhedia @hariharans29 @snnn\r\n\r\nQuoting from [MxNet BatchNorm documentation](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/training/normalization/index.html): \"One of the most popular normalization techniques is Batch Normalization, usually called BatchNorm for short. We normalize the activations across all samples in a batch for each of the channels independently.\"\r\n\r\nThe comment in the exporter refers to mean and variance per feature, instead of per channel. Fixing this will mean that spatial mode should be 1, instead of 0 in the ONNX export.\r\n\r\nChanging spatial to 1 fixed these models, in accordance with the issue referenced above.\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis PR is mainly focus on removing the overhead of sg_mkldnn_fullyconnected especially in the case of channel-wise quantization mode (no much change for FP32 or tensor-wise quantization mode) described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17705, via removing extra condition check in the current logic (weights version and calibrated data value), but leaving an ENV of `MXNET_MKLDNN_QFC_DYNAMIC_PARAMS` for the scenario of changing those values on the fly (we don't meet such usage but in case there is).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@TaoLv @eric-haibin-lin @pengzhao-intel

Description ##\r\n[`gluon.rnn.LSTM`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/rnn/index.html?highlight=lstm#mxnet.gluon.rnn.LSTM) has an argument - `projection_size` - which enables the projection feature for LSTM operator. Previously, this feature is not supported on the CPU backend. This PR aims to add it to the CPU backend. It should be noticed that only the forward pass is ready in this PR. Backward pass and `needs_grads` scenario is not adapted to this feature.
