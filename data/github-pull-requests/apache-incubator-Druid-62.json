Direct queries to these segments will be performed on historicals as being a `TableDataSource` it will fail the checks to run locally on the broker, but if wired up to a `JoinableFactory` that supplies an `IndexedTable`, can be used as part of a join clause and be run directly with the query instead of requiring a subquery join with an `InlineDatasource`.\r\n\r\nExamples to illustrate the implications/behavior, assuming `GlobalTableDataSource` is bound to `JoinableFactory`:\r\n\r\n##### 1. direct query to broadcast segment\r\nSince `GlobalTableDataSource` is a `TableDataSource`, this is queried exactly like a normal Druid segment, on the historical\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n   broadcast_table.string1,\r\n   SUM(broadcast_table.long1)\r\nFROM druid.broadcast_table\r\nGROUP BY 1\r\nORDER BY 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 2. join regular segment to broadcast\r\njoin is pushed down, join applies index table of broadcast segment to each regular segment\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  regular_table.string1,\r\n  broadcast_table.string1,\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table.long1),\r\n  SUM(regular_table.long1)\r\nFROM druid.regular_table \r\nINNER JOIN druid.broadcast_table ON regular_table.string1 = broadcast_table.string1\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3. join broadcast segment to regular\r\nbroadcast segment is queried the same as a regular table segment table to table subquery join\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  regular_table.string1,\r\n  broadcast_table.string1,\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table.long1),\r\n  SUM(regular_table.long1)\r\nFROM druid.broadcast_table\r\nINNER JOIN druid.regular_table ON broadcast_table.string1 = regular_table.string1\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 4. join broadcast segment to broadcast segment\r\nlhs broadcast segment is exactly the same as if a regular segment was used, join is pushed down, join applies index table of rhs broadcast segment2 to broadcast segment\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  broadcast_table.string1,\r\n  broadcast_table2.string1,\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table.long1),\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table2.long1)\r\nFROM druid.broadcast_table\r\nINNER JOIN druid.broadcast_table2 ON broadcast_table.string1 = broadcast_table2.string1\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 5. join broadcast to lookup\r\nlhs broadcast segment is exactly the same as if a regular segment was used, join pushed down to a historical which holds the broadcast segment and lookup is joined\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  lookup_table.v,\r\n  broadcast_table.string1,\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table.long1)\r\nFROM druid.broadcast_table \r\nINNER JOIN lookup.lookup_table ON broadcast_table.string1 = lookup_table.k\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 6. join lookup to broadcast table\r\nexecuted entirely on broker, broadcast is a joinable to the lookup which can be queried locally on the broker, this is the only path that currently will use the joinable from the `GlobalTableDataSource` on the broker\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n  lookup_table.v,\r\n  broadcast_table.string1,\r\n  SUM(broadcast_table.long1)\r\nFROM lookup.lookup_table \r\nINNER JOIN druid.broadcast_table ON lookup_table.k = broadcast_table.string1\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a fun issue introduced by #9971, which added the ability for realtime tasks and brokers to load broadcast segments, which is totally neat, but, was missing a couple of pieces. The missing piece being fixed here is for `BrokerServerView` and `DruidSchema` to ignore brokers so that they don't try to query themselves infinitely, or get metadata from themselves infinitely (well, at least until jetty gets really really sad).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9792 \r\n\r\nAnother approach to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9978\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue by having `Joinables.createSegmentMapFn` walk the query being analyzed to find instances of queries that read a `JoinDatasource`, performing the pre-analysis for these queries and storing them in a newly introduced`JoinFilterPreAnalysisGroup`.\r\n\r\nIf there is only one query level that requires the join filter rewrite pre-analysis, then the group operates in a more efficient single filter mode, as hashing/comparing filters can be expensive if they're large.\r\n\r\nThe parameters that control join filter rewrites have been moved into a `JoinFilterRewriteConfig` class.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\n`Pair` is useful when you associate two things explicitly, but it allows nulls for both `lhs` and `rhs` which sometimes leads to a false warning for missing null checks. This is not only annoying but also error-prone if we change something nullable to be nonnull or vice versa. This PR adds a simple class `NonnullPair` which extends `Pair` but disallows nulls. I also modified `CompactionTask` to use it as an example. `NonnullPair` extends `Pair` only because it was easy to implement and I wanted to avoid duplicate code. However, this causes the same false warning for missing null checks when you access the variables directly such as `nonnullPair.lhs`. This is inevitable since they are defined as public in `Pair`, we can avoid it by changing it to not extend `Pair`. I'm open to any suggestion.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nMatch the behavior of PostgreSQL for `lpad` and `rpad` functions when the pad is\r\nan empty string in SQL compliant null handling mode.\r\n\r\nBecause of how non-sql compliant null handling mode works, if a user passes in an\r\nempty string to the function, Druid treats that string as null, so in non-sql compliant\r\nnull handling mode, the behavior does not match PostgreSQL. Look at `FunctionTest#testLpad`\r\nfor greater detail about these edge cases and expected results.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or

[#9967](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9967).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR introduces an extension that improves Druid’s ingestion memory and CPU efficiency. It uses **60%** less memory and **50%** less CPU-time to achieve the same performance. This translated to nearly **double** the system's ingestion-throughput with the same memory budget, and a **75%** increase in throughput with the same CPU-time budget. The experimental setup and the full results are available [here](https://github.com/liran-funaro/druid/wiki/Evaluation).\r\n\r\nTo understand the motivation and rationale behind some of the proposed changes below, it is necessary to read the related issue: [#9967](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9967).\r\n\r\n#### Introduce `OakIncrementalIndex`\r\nWe add a new incremental index implementation: `OakIncrementalIndex` as a Druid extension. The implementation is mostly borrowed from `OnheapIncrementalIndex` and `OffheapIncrementalIndex`, but has a few notable differences:\r\n  1. It stores both **keys** and **values** off-heap (as opposed to the off-heap implementation that stores only the **values** off-heap)\r\n  1. It is based on [`OakMap`](https://github.com/yahoo/Oak) instead of Java’s `ConcurrentSkipList` (CSL)\r\n  1. It does not need to keep a mapping from row index to an actual row\r\n  1. It is always ordered (as expected by `FactsHolder.persistIterable()`), even in plain mode\r\n \r\nTo achieve the best performance of our implementation, we had to refactor some interfaces of `IncrementalIndexRow` and `IncrementalIndex`. This refactoring is explained in #12122.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this commit\r\n * Added everything under `druid/extensions-contrib/oak-incremental-index`. Most notable additions:\r\n   - `OakIncrementalIndex`: follows the `IncrementalIndex` API\r\n   - `OakIncrementalIndexRow`: follows the `IncrementalIndexRow` API\r\n   - `OakKey`: handles the serialization, deserialization, and comparison of keys\r\n * Updated benchmarks to evaluate our implementation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever it would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [X] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-08T14:07:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T00:15:34Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T00:15:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c152a926f2a4e5d2bd54b2beb47df76b205ef035","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9984 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

The flatten data has null in `JSONPathSpec`, so its parsing process can be optimized by avoding transforming to JSON first. The modified class `ProtobufInputRowParser` has passed all the tests in `ProtobufInputRowParserTest` (If necessary, we can add a unit test for flatten data). \r\n\r\nBelow is the result of `ProtobufParserBenchmark`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24449727/83990429-32b54200-a97c-11ea-87f3-b9faf205c2d2.png)\r\n\r\nIt shows that parsing flatten data can be 4 times faster than parsing data using the optimized method. \r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n#### Added test files \r\nWe added `prototest.desc`(which is a copy of `prototest.desc` in protobuf-extension test-classes)  and  `ProtoFile`(which is generated by a test in  `ProtobuInputRowTest`) under `benchmarks/src/test/resources` to simplify the process of test data preparation. The inputs for two benchmarks in `ProtobufParserBenchmark` are the same, but the results are a little different due to the request of `JSONPathSpec`. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

an optimization to allow filters on `NilVectorSelector` to use `BooleanVectorValueMatcher` for things like a selector that matches null. The bug does not cause incorrect results, it just wasn't taking an optimization which it could have been using, and matches the behavior of [`NullDimensionSelector`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/DimensionSelector.java#L237)\r\n\r\nThis was hard to functionally test with a

in rel#5415:Subset#2.NONE.[]` for part of the subquery. This Rel signature is only a single field. The other field which is a literal is not part of the groupBy and is part of the projection on top of this. \r\n\r\nNow the problem is when we try to build new Rel, in computeSubtotals with the above Rel as the sourceRel and a partialQuery with aggregate looking like `aggregate=rel#5418:LogicalAggregate.NONE.[](input=RelSubset#5417,group={0, 1}), havingFilter=null, aggregateProject=null, sort=null, sortProject=null}`. This aggregate has two bits in the groupSet. This fails without taking into account the projection mentioned above. Hence, we should skip and not build this new Rel and handle this case with CannotBuildQueryException so that we can move on to other Rels.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR makes `Joinable`, `JoinClause`, and `IndexedTable` implement an interface to allow providing a `Closeable` to callers to capture the reference counting pattern, so that a future PR can add reference counting for `IndexedTable` that are backed by a `Segment` described in proposal #9953. `HashJoinSegment` now wraps a `ReferenceCountingSegment`, allowing both the segment reference count to be incremented/decremented when used, and also closing the associated list of `JoinClause` when the references to the segment are released.\r\n\r\n`ReferenceCountingSegment` has been refactored to extend a new base type, `ReferenceCountingClosableObject`, which handles the actual reference counting part and prepare for `ReferenceCountingIndexedTable` (which does not exist yet).\r\n\r\nA new interface, `ReferenceCountedObject`, has been added to capture the `increment()` and `decrementOnceCloseable()` pattern of `ReferenceCountingCloseableObject` in one closeable:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ReferenceCountedObject\r\n{\r\n  Optional<Closeable> acquireReferences();\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnother new interface, `SegmentReference` has been added to capture a `Segment` which also implements `ReferenceCountedObject`, or in other words, has references which must be acquired and released:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface SegmentReference extends Segment, ReferenceCountedObject\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe contract of the `acquireReferences` method is that an object will return a `Closeable` if reference count could be incremented, and closing the `Closeable` is expected to be similar/the same as the underlying `decrementOnceCloseable()`.\r\n\r\n`ReferenceCountingSegment` and `HashJoinSegment` implement this `SegmentReference` interface, and `ReferenceCountingSegmentQueryRunner` now operates on this interface instead of directly using `Segment` and a `ReferenceCounter`.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR in place, `Joinable` may now be backed by an implementation of `ReferenceCountingCloseableObject` to use to fulfill the `ReferenceCountedObject` contract, allowing them to be safely dropped when not in use, and this should all be correctly wired up to the various `QuerySegmentWalker` implementations as of this PR.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have marked `AbstractSegment` as deprecated, and moved it's only functionality into a default method on the interface to make working with `Segment` a bit easier. I have not deleted `AbstractSegment` yet, it's just an empty husk that we can remove in a future release on the off chance that any custom extensions are relying on this class.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

I replaced it with the proper value after consulting [MetadataRuleManagerConfig.java](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/metadata/MetadataRuleManagerConfig.java#L30): `druid.manager.rules.defaultRule`\r\n  * For further confirmation that this doc was incorrect, you can see [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/guice/MetadataConfigModule.java#L38) where the binding is created for `druid.manager.rules` prefixed configs using the class referenced above.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR implements the following areas of proposal https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9953:\r\n- Modifying BroadcastDistributionRule\r\n- Assigning and balancing segments\r\n- Segment loading in brokers, realtime tasks, and indexers\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Adjusts BroadcastDistributionRule to remove the colocated datasources concept\r\n- Adjusts the segment balancers to skip balancing for segments that were assigned via broadcast rule\r\n- CliBroker, CliPeon, CliIndexer now bind ZKCoordinator and related classes for loading segments\r\n- Updates DruidCluster, DruidServer, ServerType and related to support the concept of a \"broadcast target\", separate from a \"replication target\"\r\n- SegmentChangeRequestLoad is updated to never prune the load spec when deserializing a DataSegment. This is needed for Brokers to load segments\r\n- A new flag has been added to the peon, indicating whether it will be running a queryable task. Non-queryable tasks such as batch tasks will not load segments.\r\n- Segment loading is optional on brokers/indexers/tasks. If the segment cache locations are not defined or empty, the SegmentLoadDropHandler will not start. On historicals this condition is treated as an error.\r\n\r\nCurrent limitations:\r\n- ~~Only ZK-based segment loading is supported~~\r\n- Only BroadcastForeverRule is fully supported (assumes that all segments of a datasource with broadcast rules will fall under a broadcast rule)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.","created_at":"2020-06-03T00:27:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T03:49:49Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T03:16:00Z","merged_at":"2020-06-09T03:16:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"771870ae2d312d643e6d98f3d0af8a9618af9681","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

PR aims to make it easier for non Druid devs to add sql tests to Druid.\r\n\r\nIf anyone in the community has particular query shapes they expect to see\r\nworking in Druid, they can add the queries to the provided config.\r\nThis will ensure the queries work as expected with each Druid release.\r\n\r\nSample ingestion specs are provided in the test/resources folder so that tests\r\nare easier to build by testing against a local cluster.\r\n\r\nyaml is chosen as the data format for the tests as it allows devs to place\r\ncomments within the configuration which helps with maintainability of the\r\ntests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all

to verify a datasource has the latest ingested data\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR address https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5721 / https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10005\r\n\r\nThe existing loadstatus API on the Coordinator reads segments from SqlSegmentsMetadataManager of the Coordinator which caches segments in memory and periodically updates them. Hence, there can be a race condition as this API implementation compares segments metadata from the mentioned cache with published segments in historicals. Particularly, when there is a new ingestion after the initial load of the datasource, the cache still only contains the metadata of old segments. The API would compares list of old segments with what is published by historical and returns that everything is available when the new segments are not actually available yet. \r\n\r\nThis new API will fix this problem. The new API will be able to do the following:\r\n- new api takes in datasource. This will returns false if any used segment (of the past 2 weeks) of the given datasource are not available to be query (i.e. not loaded onto historical yet). Return true otherwise. The interval of 2 weeks above is not finalized yet. We can decide later what is a good default number\r\n\r\n- (same) new api takes in datasource and a time interval (start + end): This will returns false if any used segment (between the given start and given end time) of the given datasource are not available to be query (i.e. not loaded onto historical yet). Return true otherwise.\r\n\r\nNote that the above are both the same API. The time interval is an optional parameter. The time interval referred above is the timestamp of the data in the segment (nothing to do with when the segment is ingested). This can be the same time interval as the time interval the user want to query data from. Basically if the user wants to query from x to y then they can call this new api with the datasource and time interval x to y. This will ensure that all segments of the datasource for the timestamp from x to y is ready to be query (loaded onto historical).\r\n\r\nImportant differencees between this API from the existing coordinator loadstatus API:\r\n- Takes datasource (required) to be able to check faster (iterate smaller number of segments)\r\n- Takes interval (optional) to be able to check faster (iterate smaller number of segments)\r\n- **IMPORATANT**. Takes boolean firstCheck. If this is true, this will force poll the metadata source to get latest published segment information.\r\n\r\nThe workflow will be :\r\n\r\n1) submit ingestion task\r\n\r\n2) poll task api until task succeeded\r\n\r\n3) poll the new api with datasource, interval, and firstCheck=true once. If false, go to step 4, otherwise the data is available and user can query.\r\n\r\n4) poll the new api with datasource, interval, and firstCheck=false until return true. After true, data is available and user can query.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Subquery could not be converted to groupBy query\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fix the issue at https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9949\r\n\r\nBefore 0.18, subquery for a DruidOuterQueryRel can only be a groupBy. Hence, we force subquery to a groupBy and fails if the subquery cannot be converted to a groupBy. However, starting from 0.18, subquery of a DruidOuterQueryRel can be any type of query (timeseries, scan, topN, etc.). In fact, even if a query can be a groupBy, it can be more performant to actually convert the query to other type such as timeseries. \r\n\r\nThis PR removes the forcing of subquery of a DruidOuterQueryRel to groupBy and instead uses the method DruidQuery#getQuery(). \r\nThis PR also address a related issue with timeseries subquery. DruidQuery.toTimeseriesQuery translates a dimension based on a timestamp_floor expression into a 'granularity'. This is not reflected in the druidQuery's output row signature. Existing code adds a \"__time\" in the output row signature to solve this. However, when DruidOuterQueryRel tries to aggregate on a timeseries subquery that is grouped by timestamp_floor expression, it fails. This is because the DruidOuterQueryRel expects a dimension (i.e. d0) but the timeseries output row signature has \"__time\" instead. This PR fixes this issue by introducing dimension field to the timeseries query. The dimension field will only be set if the timeseries is being group by timestamp. The dimension field will then be set with the correct dimension output name from the grouping. The dimension field is then use to set the timeseries query output row signature correctly. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds the ability to write define a custom `SegmentizerFactory` implementation when writing out `factory.json` during index merging, via the `IndexSpec` on the `TuningConfig` of an ingestion task, implementing part of proposal #9953. Note that otherwise standard Druid segments are written, this just allows customized additional or alternative logic to be performed when loading the `Segment`. Since this is primarily an experimental mechanism, this is purposefully not documented at this time, in favor of seeing how  #9953 evolves, and may eventually need replaced with the mechanism to write out fully custom segments.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds an optional method to the `SegmentizerFactory` interface that allows a custom segment unloading logic to occur when a segment is dropped from `SegmentLoaderLocalCacheManager`. There is a default do nothing implementation so this change shouldn't be very disruptive, but we do need to consider that cleanup will now try to read the `factory.json` file again to call this method before the files are deleted, so there is some small cost to this change.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

multi-value column (such as `SELECT dim3, l.v, count(*) from druid.foo f inner join lookup.lookyloo l on f.dim3 = l.k group by 1, 2` ), we should make this clear in the docs. Moreover, we should fail query that tries to join on multi-value column rather than silently ignoring multi-valued column and returning results back to user. This is because user may not be aware that Druid actually do not support join on multi-value column and thinking that the result is because nothing match join condition. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Join reducing to a Join with constant in the condition\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe have already documented that JOIN do not support joining on constant (for example `SELECT t1.cityName from wikipedia as t1 LEFT join wikipedia as t2 on t1.cityName = 'Buenos Aires'`). However, some valid JOIN SQL gets optimize by Calcite into a JOIN with constant in the ON condition. For example, `with abc as ( SELECT cityName, \"__time\", sum_added from wikipedia WHERE \"cityName\" = 'Buenos Aires' ) SELECT t1.cityName, t1.\"__time\" from abc as t1 LEFT join abc as t2 on t1.cityName = t2.cityName WHERE t1.cityName = 'Buenos Aires'` gets reduce to a JOIN with the condition `=($0, 'Buenos Aires')`. This then fails to plan as we do not support JOIN with constant in the ON condition. The above SQL was optimized into JOIN with constant in the ON condition due to the `ReduceExpressionsRule.JOIN_INSTANCE`. This PR disable the `ReduceExpressionsRule.JOIN_INSTANCE` rule. This will prevent valid join query that we supports (such as `with abc as ( SELECT cityName, \"__time\", sum_added from wikipedia WHERE \"cityName\" = 'Buenos Aires' ) SELECT t1.cityName, t1.\"__time\" from abc as t1 LEFT join abc as t2 on t1.cityName = t2.cityName WHERE t1.cityName = 'Buenos Aires'`) from transforming into a dead end that we cannot plan (join on constant). We are taking this approach as we do not see a strong demand for join on constant and we have already mention that we do not support join on constant. \r\n\r\nPlease see issue https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9942 for follow up work on supporting JOIN with constant in the ON condition. Once the follow up work is done, the `ReduceExpressionsRule.JOIN_INSTANCE` can be added back. The tests added in CalciteQueryTest here will also make sure there is no regression introduce by the follow up work.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9787\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the Joinable interface to return an Optional set of correlated\r\nvalues for a column.\r\nThis allows the JoinFilterAnalyzer to differentiate between the case where the\r\ncolumn has no matching values and when the column could not find matching\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nThis PR chose not to distinguish between cases where correlated values could\r\nnot be computed because of a config that has this behavior disabled or because\r\nof user error - like a column that could not be found.

The results of a query should be the same regardless of which features it uses. These parameterized tests allow us to validate that the results are in fact the same regardless of the passed in query context features.","created_at":"2020-05-26T03:11:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:02:01Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T02:10:27Z","merged_at":"2020-05-29T02:10:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"cbd587dbd64ea7e5b1a316d19752786f01e50dec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #9917 .  In this PR, a class named as `SQLMetadataTimingCollector` is added to collect and emit execution time of sqls executed on metadata storage db to help analyze sql bottleneck.\r\n\r\n`SQLMetadataTimingCollector` implements `TimingCollector` which is defined by JDBI framework. JDBI framework calculates the time cost(in millisecond) of sql execution and calls the interface to allow user to do something on their own.\r\n\r\nIn `SQLMetadataTimingCollector`, it emits cost time of sql execution via a metric `metadataStorage/sql/time`. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe default log emitter outputs this new metric as below: \r\n````\r\n2020-05-30T13:04:30,482 INFO [config-manager-0] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - {\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-05-30T13:04:30.481Z\",\"service\":\"coordinator\",\"host\":\"localhost:8081\",\"version\":\"\",\"metric\":\"metadataStorage/sql/time\",\"value\":446681,\"sql\":\"SELECT payload FROM druid_config WHERE name = ?\",\"uri\":\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/druid\"}\r\n2020-05-30T13:04:30,483 INFO [config-manager-0] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - {\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-05-30T13:04:30.483Z\",\"service\":\"coordinator\",\"host\":\"localhost:8081\",\"version\":\"\",\"metric\":\"metadataStorage/sql/time\",\"value\":375036,\"sql\":\"SELECT payload FROM druid_config WHERE name = ?\",\"uri\":\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/druid\"}\r\n2020-05-30T13:04:30,485 INFO [config-manager-0] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - {\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-05-30T13:04:30.484Z\",\"service\":\"coordinator\",\"host\":\"localhost:8081\",\"version\":\"\",\"metric\":\"metadataStorage/sql/time\",\"value\":419938,\"sql\":\"SELECT payload FROM druid_config WHERE name = ?\",\"uri\":\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/druid\"}\r\n2020-05-30T13:04:30,486 INFO [config-manager-0] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - {\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"timestamp\":\"2020-05-30T13:04:30.486Z\",\"service\":\"coordinator\",\"host\":\"localhost:8081\",\"version\":\"\",\"metric\":\"metadataStorage/sql/time\",\"value\":380552,\"sql\":\"SELECT payload FROM druid_config WHERE name = ?\",\"uri\":\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/druid\"}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis metric has two dimensions, `sql` and `uri`. \r\n- The first one is the sql being executed. All the parameters are taken as `?`. Currently it's a little bit tricky to get the sql with all parameter. If JDBI v3 is being used, it's easy to get it, for v2, it's not easy. But I think this does not matter to analyze the sql performance in general.\r\n- The latter one is the instance info of database(connection string) which helps people know where the sql is executed on

Are you sure this is what you want?` in coordinator logs even when metricSpec is present but empty in the schema. It is annoying and fills up the logs. If metricSpec is present but is explicitly set to empty, then we do not need to show this warn log message. (After all the user did include and explicitly set metricSpec to empty in the ingestionSpec so they probably know what they are doing).\r\n\r\nAlso, improve log message to make it clearer. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAliyun is the 3rd largest cloud infrastructure provider in the world, and the 1st in China. It provides its own storage solution known as OSS (Object Storage Service), which is very similar to Amazon S3 from the client interface perspective view.\r\n\r\nTo support Aliyun OSS as a choice of deep storage is meaningful. It could enrich the ecosystem of druid, and could draw attentions of so many Aliyun customers.\r\n\r\nBecause the interfaces between Amazon S3 and Aliyun OSS are very similar, the code in this PR is based on that of s3 extensions.\r\n\r\nI've tested this extensions in test environment based on 0.18.1 branch for several days, including ingestion/compact/kill segments, index task logs. All data are stored/retrieved/deleted successfully.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Although one possible scenario is if the ingestionSpec posted to Druid explicitly contains availabilityGroup set to null (For example, \"resource\":{\"availabilityGroup\":null,\"requiredCapacity\":1}).\r\n\r\nRegardless of how it happened, we should fail task that has availabilityGroup = null by enforcing availabilityGroup not null on TaskResource. We should do this for the following reason:\r\n1) Bad task with availabilityGroup = null should not be able to affect other good tasks running on the cluster (especially as those other tasks can be for different datasource, etc.). Hence, the bad  task with availabilityGroup = null should fail fast instead of running normally.\r\n2) We should fail fast so that we know exactly how / where TaskResource got created with availabilityGroup = null.

deleting a data node tier causes load rules to display incorrectly\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a tier is removed and that tier is currently being used in a rule, the actual rule in the database does not gets modified (rule stay as-is). However, the UI console stops showing the removed tier from the \"Edit retention rules\" page. Hence, the rules that the user is seeing in the UI will be different than what is actually being run by Druid / stored in the database. This can be very misleading as it hides that the rule is in a bad state (Replicants refers to non-existent tier). We should continue to show the tier even if it does not exist. This will make sure that we are consistent and truthful to the source of truth (a.k.a the metadata store). User can also be aware and change as they realized that the tier that the Replicants is currently set to does not exist.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR proposes to remove the `payload` field from table `sys.segments` mainly to handle performance issue caused by serializing object to JSON string.\r\n\r\n### Drop alternative\r\nAdd a projection rule for scanning table `sys.segment`.\r\n\r\n### Operational impact\r\nSince the `payload` field has been already public documented, it's a little aggressive to remove it. But I would like to suppose that there may be rare possibility someone has a dependency on this field. The RESTful `api /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId} ` should be the priority option to retrieve segment metadata.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9876.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently when brokers use custom priority list,  all the priorities of existing tiers need to be explicitly specified in `druid.broker.select.tier.custom.priorities`, otherwise NPE will be thrown when brokers update their server views next time there's segment movement happening in historical nodes. This PR fixes the NPE by assigning and clearly documenting default behaviors to all possible scenarios of the input of the config  `druid.broker.select.tier.custom.priorities`: the config only has effect if `druid.broker.select.tier` is set to `custom`. If `druid.broker.select.tier` is set to `custom` but this config is not specified, the effect is the same as `druid.broker.select.tier` set to `highestPriority`. Any of the integers in this config can be ignored if there's no corresponding tiers with such priorities. Tiers with priorities explicitly specified in this config always have higher priority than those not and those not specified fall back to use `highestPriority` strategy among themselves. There should be no backward compatibility issue because before this change, there is NPE in front.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAdd an automated way of checking if new code has adequate unit tests, since merging code coverage reports and check coverage thresholds via coveralls or codecov is unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe following minimum unit test code coverage is now enforced on new code:\r\n- 80% functions\r\n- 65% branch\r\n- 65% line\r\n\r\nBranch and line coverage thresholds are slightly lower for now as they are harder to achieve.\r\n\r\nAfter the code coverage check looks reliable, the thresholds can be increased later if needed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

#9846\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixes the native ingestion issue where if you do not explicitly specify the partitionDimension, it leads to lesser rollup compared to the case when you do.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible solutions to the problem. More details in the original bug report. This implements one of the solution. \r\n\r\nThe primary problem is when we hash a row during the generate phase, we use timestamp as part of the hashKey along with the dimensions in the dimensionSpec. When we explicitly specify partitionDimensions, we do not use timestamp. In the native ingestion path, using row timestamps messes up the bucket assignment for these rows and 2 rows with same dimension values can end up in different buckets. This leads to lesser rollup. More details in the bug report.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have made Native ingestion match what Hadoop does. Instead of sending the actual timestamp it sends the interval start corresponding to the interval bucket this timestamp falls in. \r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug #9846 \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`ParquetReader` fetches the input file and creates a reader in its constructor. These are registered on a `Closer` which is closed when the `CloseableIterator` returned from `intermediateRowIterator` is exhausted. This can lead to potential resource leaks if the task is canceled without calling `intermediateRowIterator`. I think the fetched file will be still deleted when the task is canceled since it is created in the task temporary working directory. The reader will also be closed when the peon is shut down on middleManager. So, probably the resource leak will exist only with Indexer. However, it would be nice to clean up all resources properly when it should be rather than depending on other clean up mechanism. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR propose a schema changing for metadata tables to replace the varchar primary key with an auto-increment integer primary key. \r\n\r\nThis changing seems dogmatic and old-fashioned at first. But it really matters if you have been complained by the internal DBA team for the heavy load caused by druid metadata db.\r\n\r\nAs we know that the auto-increment integer primary key usually has better performance than UUID primary key, especially if the table contains a large number of rows, eg: druid_segments and druid_pendingSegments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThis avoids the jetty behavior of sending server version information as part of the response headers.\r\nPresently, response headers from druid would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Encoding | gzip\r\nContent-Type | application/json\r\nDate | Wed, 06 May 2020 15:36:16 GMT\r\nServer | Jetty(9.4.10.v20180503)\r\nTransfer-Encoding | chunked\r\nVary | Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisibility of server version in response headers as above can be seen as a security issue as it could potentially allow an attacker to use version specific exploits, once the server version is identified using banner grabbing or active reconnaissance techniques.\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change validates an assumption made HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter. It was assumed that the filter used during join filter pre-analysis is the same as the filter passed to the HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter to make a cursor. As pointed out in #9792, this is not always the case. This change makes it so that any query that violates this assumption fails rather than showing incorrect results.\r\n\r\nThe issue is surfaced when nested groupby queries operate on a non-table datasource. This is because the GroupByQueryQueryToolChest has optimizations built in to it that pushes down the filters from the outer group by to the inner query when making the cursor. So the pre-join analysis is invalid. The result of this bug is that as of 0.18 filters in the outer groupBy are ignored.\r\n\r\nThis PR fails the query rather than providing the user with invalid results. A follow up PR is needed to address #9792 so that the query executes correctly.\r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\nThis PR introduces an annotation `SubclassesMustOverrideEqualsAndHashCode` to indicate that the default implementation of equals and hashcode on a class is insufficient because it may be used in equals comparisons elsewhere.\r\nA test `SubclassesMustOverrideEqualsAndHashCodeTest` is implemented to find any implementations that violate this constraint.\r\nThis PR also adds EqualsVerifier tests for all implementations that required a custom equals and hashcode implementation.\r\nAs a result of this dependence, some annonymous inner classes needed to be implemented as static inner classes.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-06T07:24:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:11:35Z","closed_at":"2020-05-13T21:23:05Z","merged_at":"2020-05-13T21:23:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0167295d7c621bfa9722b7203bc7ca08fc76495","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area
