href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/192\">actions/setup-go#192</a>)</li>\n<li>Update <code>package-lock.json</code> file version to 2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/193\">actions/setup-go#193</a>) and <code>@types/node</code> to 16.11.25 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/194\">actions/setup-go#194</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove the <code>stable</code> input and fix SemVer notation (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/195\">actions/setup-go#195</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>With the update to Node 16, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</p>\n<p>This new major release removes the <code>stable</code> input, so there is no need to specify additional input to use pre-release versions. This release also corrects the pre-release versions syntax to satisfy the SemVer notation (1.18.0-beta1 -&gt; 1.18.0-beta.1, 1.18.0-rc1 -&gt; 1.18.0-rc.1).</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n    with:\n      go-version: '1.18.0-rc.1' \n  - run: go version\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Add check-latest input</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/186\">check-latest</a> input. If <code>check-latest</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally cached version is not the most up-to-date, a Go version will then be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/go-versions\">go-versions</a> repository. By default <code>check-latest</code> is set to <code>false</code>.\nExample of usage:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v2\n    with:\n      go-version: '1.16'\n      check-latest: true\n  - run: go version\n</code></pre>\n<p>Moreover, we updated <code>@actions/core</code> from <code>1.2.6</code> to <code>1.6.0</code></p>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>matchers.json</code>  to improve the problem matcher pattern. For more information please refer to this <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/98\">pull request</a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix extractor selection on windows by <a href=\"https://github.com/paulcacheux\"><code>@​paulcacheux</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/141\">actions/setup-go#141</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/paulcacheux\"><code>@​paulcacheux</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/141\">actions/setup-go#141</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-go/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4\">https://github.com/actions/setup-go/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4</a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated communication with runner to use environment files rather then workflow commands</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.2</h2>\n<p>This release includes vendored licenses for this action's npm dependencies.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Please use more specific and flexible syntax to specify a PyPy version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        python-version:\n        - 'pypy-2.7' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 2.7\n        - 'pypy-3.8' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 3.8\n        - 'pypy-3.8-v7.3.8' # Python 3.8 and PyPy 7.3.8\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See more usage examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python#specifying-a-pypy-version\">documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Update primary and restore keys for pip</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/303\">include a version of python in restore and primary cache keys for pip</a>. Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a> dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when you want to override current behaviour and use different file for hash generation (for example requirements-dev.txt). This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Caching pip dependencies:</h3>\n<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v2\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I would like to thank @xiazcy, @simonz-bq, @L0Lmaker, @vkagamlyk, @spmallette, and @krlawrence for continued help they have all been putting into this.\r\n\r\nWe have all tests passing in the Cucumber test suite, have integrated the driver into the TinkerPop build infrastructure and have added all remaining features to the driver at this point.\r\n\r\nFrom here we will be working on enhancing documentation, adding performance testing, and bug fixes to any issues which are exposed.\r\n\r\nPull request comments will be addressed as part of the next milestone.\r\n\r\nThis pull request will remain open for at least a week, so the community has a chance to look at it and critique it.","created_at":"2022-04-13T01:19:36Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T02:25:41Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T02:25:41Z","merged_at":"2022-04-27T02:25:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"eee41140eca6b6b66385d57c632145fdf9153e34","assignee":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"krlawrence","id":27897072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODk3MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27897072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/krlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/12df6fbfaf0b0013bcd4580bda549eba0ea960be","head":{"label":"lyndonbauto:gremlin-go-ms5","ref":"gremlin-go-ms5","sha":"12df6fbfaf0b0013bcd4580bda549eba0ea960be","user":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":430945337,"node_id":"R_kgDOGa-0OQ","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"lyndonbauto/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatar

<code>Infinity</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented comparability/orderability semantics defined in the Graph Provider documentation.</li>\n<li>Added <code>TextP.regex</code> and <code>TextP.notRegex</code>.</li>\n<li>Changed TinkerGraph to allow identifiers to be heterogeneous when filtering.</li>\n<li>Prevented values of <code>T</code> to <code>property()</code> from being <code>null</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>element()</code> step.</li>\n<li>Added <code>call()</code> step.</li>\n<li>Added <code>fail()</code> step.</li>\n<li>Added <code>mergeV()</code> and <code>mergeE()</code> steps.</li>\n<li>Added <code>Direction</code> aliases of <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved <code>TraversalOptionParent.Pick</code> to its own class as <code>Pick</code>.</li>\n<li>Introduced Pythonic Gremlin step names using snake case and deprecated camel case naming.</li>\n<li>Improved Gherkin test framework to allow for asserting traversal exceptions as a behavior.</li>\n<li>Fixed query indentation for profile metrics where indent levels were not being respected.</li>\n<li><code>TraversalOpProcessor</code> no longer accepts a <code>String</code> representation of <code>Bytecode</code> for the &quot;gremlin&quot; argument which was left to support older versions of the drivers.</li>\n<li>Removed requirement that &quot;ids&quot; used to filter vertices and edges need to be all of a single type.</li>\n<li>Created <code>gremlin-annotations</code> module where the <code>@GremlinDsl</code> annotation and related code has been moved.</li>\n<li>Moved <code>GremlinScriptChecker</code> to <code>gremlin-core</code> from <code>gremlin-groovy</code> since it is not Groovy dependent.</li>\n<li>Removed <code>groovy</code> and <code>groovy-json</code> dependencies from <code>gremlin-driver</code> as well as related <code>JsonBuilder</code> serialization support.</li>\n<li>Replaced log4j usage with logback where builds rely on and packaged distributions now contain the latter.</li>\n<li>Improved behavior of <code>V()</code> and <code>E()</code> when <code>null</code> is an argument producing a filtering behavior rather than an exception.</li>\n<li>Prevented metrics computation unless the traversal is in a locked state.</li>\n<li>Added syntax to Gremlin grammar to explicitly define <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code> and <code>BigInteger</code>.</li>\n<li>Added syntax to Gremlin grammar to allow construction of a reference <code>Vertex</code>.</li>\n<li>Changed Gremlin grammar to allow for Groovy-like syntax when parsing a <code>Map</code> literal.</li>\n<li>Created a way to produce a corpus of Gremlin traversals via <code>FeatureReader</code> and <code>DocumentationReader</code> in <code>gremlin-language</code>.</li>\n<li>Changed mechanism for determining if <code>id</code> equality with <code>toString()</code> is used by validating that elements of the predicate collection are all <code>String</code> rather than enforcing homogenous collections in the process.</li>\n<li>Exposed Gherkin tests as part of the provider test suite.</li>\n<li>Packaged Gherkin tests and data as standalone package as a convenience distribution.</li>\n<li>Removed <code>ProductiveByStrategy</code> as a strategy that is applied by default.</li>\n<li>Changed <code>by()</code> modulator semantics to consistently filter.</li>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated Gryo <code>MessageSerializer</code> implementations.</li>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated <code>AuthenticationSettings.enableAuditLog</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated <code>GroovyTranslator</code> from <code>gremlin-groovy</code> module.</li>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated Gremlin steps that conflicted with Python keywords.</li>\n<li>Removed the dependency on <code>six</code> from <code>gremlin-python</code>.</li>\n<li>Bumped to Apache Hadoop 3.3.1.</li>\n<li>Bumped to Apache Spark 3.2.0.</li>\n<li>Bumped node.js in <code>gremlin-javascript</code> to v16.13.0.</li>\n<li>Changed <code>NumberHelper</code> to properly cast to <code>byte</code> and <code>short</code> rather than default coercing to <code>Integer</code>.</li>\n<li>Modified some driver defaults (maximum content length, pool size, maximum in process) to be more consistent with one another.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What This Pull Request Contains\r\nThis has the changes for Milestone 1 through 4 of the gremlin-go driver. The expectation is that this driver, though not fully featured, will work for almost all use cases.\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to use the driver like any other GLV, though there are some advanced features missing (and it has not been optimized with connection pooling yet).\r\n\r\n# Cucumber Test Suite Considerations\r\nWe have all tests passing in the Cucumber test suite, have integrated the driver into the TinkerPop build infrastructure and have the driver ready for an actual release.\r\n\r\nThere has been some minor changes since the Cucumber test suite was last run, but I will re-run it and will update the PR with the result as we expect 100% pass rate there.\r\n\r\n# Shoutout to Persons Involved\r\nI would like to thank @xiazcy, @simonz-bq, @L0Lmaker, @vkagamlyk, @divijvaidya, @krlawrence and @spmallette for continued work they have all been putting into this either through implementing features or through code reviews.\r\n\r\n# Outstanding Items from Prior Review\r\nI wanted to get a PR up against 3.5-dev sooner than later with the impeding code freeze, so with that in mind I left a couple comments open from the past PR, which I will be addressing shortly. The comments are from @divijvaidya, and are follows:\r\n\r\n> 1. For Client.Close() ===> Please document whether this API is idempotent or not. Ideally, a close API call should be idempotent. You can achieve this by adding a lifecycle state variable with client which goes from INITIALIZED -> CLOSING -> CLOSED. If close() API is called when the client is not in INITIALIZED state, then it should be a no-op.\r\n> 2. Please log errors at error level logging before passing the error to the user application at all public interfaces such as NewClient or client.submit().\r\n> 3. We are missing integration tests against the server (unless I missed something), which can validate the client behaviour in scenario such as:\r\n>    1. server initiated abrupt WS connection disconnect\r\n>    2. websocket handshake times out with the server\r\n>    3. server disconnects a connection but client sends a query on that connection afterwards etc.\r\n> 4.

is an initial PR containing the suggested documentation for `mergeV` and `mergeE`. Given the power, and likely rapid uptake, of these new steps, I have tried to do a fairly detailed coverage. To make the examples a little more fresh, I chose to show adding dogs to the graph and diverge from just showing yet another way to create the \"Toy graph\".  If people decide that they don't like this approach we can fall back to adding the toy graph.  I just get a lot of comments from users asking why all the examples in our docs use the same graph and felt that a slightly different data set made sense to demonstrate the power of these new steps. \r\n\r\nNot looking for a VOTE right away. Let's discuss and make any changes first.

Issue:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2717\r\n\r\n### Problem:\r\nPer [RFC 6455 WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-1.4), either peer in a websocket an initiate a close handshake by sending a close message frame. In practical terms, a Gremlin server can send a close message to the client and the client should notify in-flight requests and acknowledge the closure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gremln.NET does not check for a `WebSocketMessageType.Close`, resulting in a `NullReferenceException` when attempting to deserialize an empty message body.\r\n\r\n### Fix:\r\nChange addresses this in the following way:\r\n1. Adds `ConnectionClosedException` that includes CloseStatus and CloseDescription properties that a WebSocket close message can return.\r\n2. Checks for `WebSocketMessageType.Close` in WebSocketConnection.ReceiveMessageAsync` and throws the exception.\r\n\r\nFrom there, `Connection.ReceiveMessagesAsync` already handles catching any exception thrown by the `WebSocketConnection` and will complete the close handshake and notify all in-flight requests of the exception.\r\n\r\n### Additional Changes:\r\n\r\n- Added `IClientWebSocket`/`ProxyClientWebSocket` to enable unit testing on interactions with `System.Net.Websockets.ClientWebSocket`. This included adding internal property `WebSocketSettings.WebSocketFactoryCallback` so that a mocked version of `IClientWebSocket` can be injected.\r\n- Added `ConnectionTests` to validate proper handling of close message and `ConnectionClosedException` propagation to in-flight requests.","created_at":"2022-03-10T18:39:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T09:21:45Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T09:21:45Z","merged_at":"2022-03-30T09:21:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2db52ab2357e90177c9df1819eb6eaf574f3d1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/924db8c0b7374287f0227426ae17ed462ceb1d4d","head":{"label":"olivertowers:TINKERPOP-2717","ref":"TINKERPOP-2717","sha":"924db8c0b7374287f0227426ae17ed462ceb1d4d","user":{"login":"olivertowers","id":24803650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODAzNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24803650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers","html_url":"https://github.com/olivertowers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152688746,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI2ODg3NDY=","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"olivertowers/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"olivertowers","id":24803650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODAzNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24803650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers","html_url":"https://github.com/olivertowers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olivertowers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/olivertowers/tinkerpop","description":"Mirror

made:\r\n* `GraphTraversal`/`GraphTraversalSource`: Ensure that no `NullReferenceException` gets thrown. Either allow `null` as an argument or throw an `ArgumentNullException` if it doesn't seem sensible and if Java also doesn't allow `null`.\r\n* `__`: Simply forward all `null` arguments to the steps in `GraphTraversal` so they can be handled there and we don't need to duplicate the logic whether we want to allow `null` or throw.\r\n\r\nI had to adapt the `DotNetTranslator` a bit as the logic to avoid problems where multiple overloads would be possible was to eager. This resulted in a `params object[]` argument that should be set to `null` for a scenario, being actually tested with an `object[]` which had `null` as an element. This let the scenarios pass although users would get a `NullReferenceException` since they probably won't add the unnecessary `object` cast.\r\nExample:\r\n`HasKey('name', null)` -> threw a `NullReferenceException`\r\n`HasKey('name', (object) null)` -> passed\r\n\r\nVOTE

PythonTranslator still generates the old style for now which is helpful because it continues to test the deprecation working all the way through to the new functions.\r\n\r\nDon't think there is a huge rush to drop the deprecated steps. We can move the translator for the next major release and that will set us up to remove the deprecated steps at our leisure in the major following that (or later if desired).

includes the changes from #1564 which targets `3.5-dev` and adds a commit to fix scenarios that are only on `master`.\r\n\r\nThis uncovered a bug in the `HasId` step that threw a `NullReferenceException` if the second argument was `null`. We probably have the same problem with other steps that are just not tested yet for `null`. I however haven't touched them here as I'm not sure yet where we actually want to allow `null`.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the tag `AllowNullPropertyValues` automatically in .NET simply didn't work as we checked for the tag on the feature, but it's on the scenario.\r\n\r\nVOTE

were three categories of scenarios ignored that are now enabled:\r\n* Some scenarios passed without any change. I don't know why they were ignored in the first place. Maybe we've fixed something in the meantime but forgot to enable them again.\r\n* Some scenarios expect a decimal type as the result but the server sends a double because .NET also uses double by default in its traversals. So I changed the assertion to pass if the values are equal although the types don't match (for decimal and double only).\r\n* One scenario required a more complex assertion as it expects an array of dictionaries which means that we have to perform a deep equality check.\r\n\r\nThe only kind of scenario(s) (we only have one of them on `3.5-dev`) that is still ignores uses `null` as a key in a map which is simply not supported in .NET. So, that's a feature that just cannot support in .NET.\r\n\r\nI'll create a different PR for `master` as we have additional scenarios there that are not on `3.5-dev`.\r\n\r\nVOTE

href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases\">pytest's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>7.0.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 7.0.0 (2022-02-03)</h1>\n<p>(<strong>Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 7.0.0rc1 notes below</strong>)</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9488\">#9488</a>: If custom subclasses of nodes like <code>pytest.Item</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} override the\n<code>__init__</code> method, they should take <code>**kwargs</code>. See\n<code>uncooperative-constructors-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for details.</p>\n<p>Note that a deprection warning is only emitted when there is a conflict in the\narguments pytest expected to pass. This deprecation was already part of pytest\n7.0.0rc1 but wasn't documented.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9355\">#9355</a>: Fixed error message prints function decorators when using assert in Python 3.8 and above.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9396\">#9396</a>: Ensure <code>pytest.Config.inifile</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;attr&quot;} is available during the <code>pytest_cmdline_main &lt;_pytest.hookspec.pytest_cmdline_main&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} hook (regression during <code>7.0.0rc1</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improved Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9404\">#9404</a>: Added extra documentation on alternatives to common misuses of [pytest.warns(None)]{.title-ref} ahead of its deprecation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9505\">#9505</a>: Clarify where the configuration files are located. To avoid confusions documentation mentions\nthat configuration file is located in the root of the repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Trivial/Internal Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9521\">#9521</a>: Add test coverage to assertion rewrite path.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>pytest 7.0.0rc1 (2021-12-06)</h1>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259\">#7259</a>: The <code>Node.reportinfo() &lt;non-python tests&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} function first return value type has been expanded from [py.path.local | str]{.title-ref} to [os.PathLike[str] | str]{.title-ref}.</p>\n<p>Most plugins which refer to [reportinfo()]{.title-ref} only define it as part of a custom <code>pytest.Item</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} implementation.\nSince [py.path.local]{.title-ref} is a [os.PathLike[str]]{.title-ref}, these plugins are unaffacted.</p>\n<p>Plugins and users which call [reportinfo()]{.title-ref}, use the first return value and interact with it as a [py.path.local]{.title-ref}, would need to adjust by calling [py.path.local(fspath)]{.title-ref}.\nAlthough preferably, avoid the legacy [py.path.local]{.title-ref} and use [pathlib.Path]{.title-ref}, or use [item.location]{.title-ref} or [item.path]{.title-ref}, instead.</p>\n<p>Note: pytest was not able to provide a deprecation period for this change.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

support was only added in .NET 6 which made it necessary to explicitly add .NET 6 as an additional target framework. Compression will now be enabled by default on .NET 6 as it's only available there. This made it necessary to add conditional compilation based on the target framework.\r\n\r\n### Package validation\r\n\r\nI also enabled [package validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/package-validation/overview) so we a) notice if we introduce breaking changes by accident and b) ensure that our code compiled against .NET Standard 2.0 can also be run against .NET 6. This already helped me to keep the breaking change here to a minimum. It's just an added optional parameter here to be able to disable compression. We could refactor the `GremlinClient` constructors in the future in a way to avoid this problem of having to add optional parameters for new config options which is always a breaking change. The validation is executed on `dotnet pack` which gets already executed via `mvn verify` and is therefore also part of our GH actions.\r\n\r\nCompatibility errors that we know about and that we accept should be added to the `CompatibilitySuppressions.xml` file which  can also be generated via\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet pack Gremlin.Net.csproj /p:GenerateCompatibilitySuppressionFile=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possibly vulnerable to attacks (CRIME / BREACH)\r\n\r\nWebSocket compression can be problematic due to attacks like CRIME/BREACH as noted in TINKERPOP-2682. So, I added an option to easily disable it for applications that might be vulnerable and added docs to make users aware of this.\r\n\r\nI guess we should discuss how we want to deal with this in general as it's not specific to .NET. So, should we simply add similar notes to the Java/Python docs?\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\nLastly, some quick benchmarks I ran on my machine:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**GraphBinary:**\r\n\r\nWithout compression:\r\nPackets transmitted: 3594\r\nBytes transmitted: 7MB\r\nRuntime: 1min 1.5sec\r\n\r\nWith compression:\r\nPackets transmitted: 62 (1.7%)\r\nBytes transmitted: 34KB (0.5%)\r\nRuntime: 1.3sec\r\n\r\n**GraphSON 3:**\r\n\r\nWithout compression:\r\nPackets transmitted: 12029\r\nBytes transmitted: 25MB\r\nRuntime: 1min 40sec\r\n\r\nWith compression:\r\nPackets transmitted: 116 (1.0%)\r\nBytes transmitted: 103KB (0.4%)\r\nRuntime: 1min 39sec\r\n\r\nSo, both for GraphSON as well as for GraphBinary the network traffic shrinks by a factor of ~100 while the total runtime is not affected. Note that this was just a very simple benchmark (I used the same traversal as @spmallette used in the PRs for Python and Java, just with a smaller number of iterations to keep the runtime to a minimum). The results will of course vary for different traversals / graphs.\r\n\r\nVOTE

has the changes for Milestone 1 of the gremlin-go driver. We ended up losing our commit history, but I would like to thank @xiazcy, @simonz-bq, and @L0Lmaker for the work they put into this. Going forward we will make sure commits are properly preserved.\r\n\r\nWith this milestone, a user can send string queries and receive string results. A 'Getting Started' section is being worked on and will add more detail on how this can be used at this stage.\r\n\r\nPull request comments will be added as backlog items for the next milestone, instead of being addressed within this pull request.\r\n\r\nThis pull request will remain open for a week or so, so the community has a chance to look at it and critique it.","created_at":"2022-01-31T20:53:48Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T21:57:22Z","closed_at":"2022-02-16T21:57:22Z","merged_at":"2022-02-16T21:57:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"87c75f7afcc260bb23efce7f17a05aee5bd92f11","assignee":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/9f1ccb12a6c996c5105b56f0726eac863d27fe90","head":{"label":"lyndonbauto:gremlin-go","ref":"gremlin-go","sha":"9f1ccb12a6c996c5105b56f0726eac863d27fe90","user":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":430945337,"node_id":"R_kgDOGa-0OQ","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"lyndonbauto/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

that this only affects our build process and the Gremlin.Net.Template.

I'm just opening the PR now as I have the contribution ready, but I can also simply retarget this on `3.5-dev` if we don't get it merged before code freeze.\r\n\r\nI verified that the Docker build
