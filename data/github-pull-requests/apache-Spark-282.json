What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the Structured Streaming sources and sinks does not have a way to report custom metrics. Providing an option to report custom metrics and making it available via Streaming Query progress can enable sources and sinks to report custom progress information (E.g. the lag metrics for Kafka source).\r\n\r\nSimilar metrics can be reported for Sinks as well, but would like to get initial feedback before proceeding further.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Instrumentation class to make it more flexible and a little bit easier to use. When these APIs are merged, I'll followup with a PR to update the training code to use these new APIs so we can remove the old APIs. These changes are all to private APIs so this PR doesn't make any user facing changes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

Background\r\nWhen I use structured streaming to construct my application, there is something odd! The application always set option [spark.sql.shuffle.partitions] to default value [200]. Even though, I set [spark.sql.shuffle.partitions] to other value by SparkConf or --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=100,  but it doesn't work. The option value is default value as before.\r\n# Analyse\r\nI review the relevant code. The relevant code is in [org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.OffsetSeqMetadata].\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/** Set the SparkSession configuration with the values in the metadata */\r\n  def setSessionConf(metadata: OffsetSeqMetadata, sessionConf: RuntimeConfig): Unit = {\r\n    OffsetSeqMetadata.relevantSQLConfs.map(_.key).foreach { confKey =>\r\n\r\n      metadata.conf.get(confKey) match {\r\n\r\n        case Some(valueInMetadata) =>\r\n          // Config value exists in the metadata, update the session config with this value\r\n          val optionalValueInSession = sessionConf.getOption(confKey)\r\n          if (optionalValueInSession.isDefined && optionalValueInSession.get != valueInMetadata) {\r\n            logWarning(s\"Updating the value of conf '$confKey' in current session from \" +\r\n              s\"'${optionalValueInSession.get}' to '$valueInMetadata'.\")\r\n          }\r\n          sessionConf.set(confKey, valueInMetadata)\r\n\r\n        case None =>\r\n          // For backward compatibility, if a config was not recorded in the offset log,\r\n          // then log it, and let the existing conf value in SparkSession prevail.\r\n          logWarning (s\"Conf '$confKey' was not found in the offset log, using existing value\")\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn this code, we can find it always set some option in metadata value. But as user, we want to those option can set by user. So I changed this code.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/** Set the SparkSession configuration with the values in the metadata */\r\n  def setSessionConf(metadata: OffsetSeqMetadata, sessionConf: RuntimeConfig):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make PySpark compatible with Python 3.7.  There are rather radical change in semantic of `StopIteration` within a generator. It now throws it as a `RuntimeError`.\r\n\r\nTo make it compatible, we should fix it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    next(...)\r\nexcept StopIteration\r\n    return\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [release note](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#porting-to-python-3-7) and [PEP 479](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```\r\n $ ./run-tests --python-executables=python3.7\r\nRunning PySpark tests. Output is in /.../spark/python/unit-tests.log\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python3.7']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-core', 'pyspark-ml',

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a streaming query has multiple watermark, the policy is to choose the min of them as the global watermark. This is safe to do as the global watermark moves with the slowest stream, and is therefore is safe as it does not unexpectedly drop some data as late, etc. While this is indeed the safe thing to do, in some cases, you may want the watermark to advance with the fastest stream, that is, take the max of multiple watermarks. This PR is to add that configuration. It makes the following changes. \r\n\r\n- Adds a configuration to specify max as the policy.\r\n- Saves the configuration in OffsetSeqMetadata because changing it in the middle can lead to unpredictable results. \r\n   - For old checkpoints without the configuration, it assumes the default policy as min (irrespective of the policy set at the session where the query is being restarted). This is to ensure that existing queries are affected in any way. \r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [ ] Add a test for recovery from existing checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test","created_at":"2018-07-03T04:31:28Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T01:08:14Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T01:08:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44169f4073f8af8a3568f6f8bc46cb8895a6d38f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ca2849d99bfa84567aa26c236a30c342d8d46ad","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-24730","ref":"SPARK-24730","sha":"2ca2849d99bfa84567aa26c236a30c342d8d46ad","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes breaking down configuration of retaining batch size on state into two pieces: files and in memory (cache). While this patch reuses existing configuration for files, it introduces new configuration, \"spark.sql.streaming.maxBatchesToRetainInMemory\" to configure max count of batch to retain in memory.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nApply this patch on top of SPARK-24441 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21469), and manually tested in various workloads to ensure overall size of states in memory is around 2x or less of the size of latest version of state, while it was 10x ~ 80x before applying the patch.","created_at":"2018-07-02T22:23:03Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T08:04:51Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T07:11:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa157325be24814fd4bf8ce322ea42b27e4d4524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf78a2a25791a683c0ee36b08bdc79edd54f212a","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-24717","ref":"SPARK-24717","sha":"cf78a2a25791a683c0ee36b08bdc79edd54f212a","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe RDD repartition uses a round-robin way to distribute data, thus there may be data correctness issue if only a sub-set of partitions are recomputed on fetch failure and the input data sequence is not deterministic.\r\n\r\nThe RDD data type may be not sortable, so we cannot resolve the whole issue by insert a local sort before shuffle (while we shall still provide that solution as a optional choice for those RDDs with sortable data type). The approach proposed in this PR is to always recompute all the partitions before shuffle on fetch failure, thus we don't rely on certain input data sequence.\r\n\r\nPlease note that with the feather on you may observe a higher risk of job falling due to reach max consequence stage failure limit, esp. for large jobs running on a big cluster.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n- Add unit tests.\r\n- Integration test on my own cluster.\r\n- Benchmark to ensure no performance regression when fetch failure doesn't happen.","created_at":"2018-07-02T12:38:47Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T14:48:59Z","closed_at":"2018-08-24T14:48:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c11f2a83ec098f9295aa08040b171918e7a519c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52e76e9306d94de747f94a6b35ba5cbc32df7ccf","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:fix-rdd-repartition","ref":"fix-rdd-repartition","sha":"52e76e9306d94de747f94a6b35ba5cbc32df7ccf","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring SPARK-24418 (Upgrade Scala to 2.11.12 and 2.12.6), we upgrade `jline` version together. So, `mvn` works correctly. However, `sbt` brings old jline library and is hitting `NoSuchMethodError` in `master` branch, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21495#issuecomment-401560826. This overrides jline version in SBT to make sbt build work.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the power iteration clustering test in  spark ml, maps the results to the labels 0 and 1 for assertion. Since the clustering outputs need not be the same as the mapped labels, it may cause failure in the test case. Even if it correctly maps, theoretically we cannot guarantee which set belongs to which cluster label. KMeans can assign label 0 to either of the set. \r\n\r\nPowerIterationClusteringSuite in the MLLib checks the clustering results without mapping to the particular cluster label, as shown below.\r\n``

column sort, pagination and search for Stage Page using jQuery DataTable and REST API. Before this commit, the Stage page generated a hard-coded HTML table that could not support search. Supporting search and sort (over all applications rather than the 20 entries in the current page) in any case will greatly improve the user experience.\r\nCreated the stagespage-template.html for displaying application information in datables. Added REST api endpoint and javascript code to fetch data from the endpoint and display it on the data table.\r\nBecause of the above change, certain functionalities in the page had to be modified to support the addition of datatables. For example, the toggle checkbox 'Select All' previously would add the checked fields as columns in the Task table and as rows in the Summary Metrics table, but after the change, only columns are added in the Task Table as it got tricky to add rows dynamically in the datatables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have attached the screenshots of the Stage Page UI before and after the fix.\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1419\" alt=\"30564304-35991e1c-9c8a-11e7-850f-2ac7a347f600\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is proposing a fix for the output data type of ```If``` and ```CaseWhen``` expression. Upon till now, the implementation of exprassions has ignored nullability of nested types from different execution branches and returned the type of the first branch.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to an unwanted ```NullPointerException``` from other expressions depending on a ```If```/```CaseWhen``` expression.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nval rows = new util.ArrayList[Row]()\r\nrows.add(Row(true, (\"a\", 1)))\r\nrows.add(Row(false, (null, 2)))\r\nval schema = StructType(Seq(\r\n  StructField(\"cond\", BooleanType, false),\r\n  StructField(\"s\", StructType(Seq(\r\n    StructField(\"val1\", StringType, true),\r\n    StructField(\"val2\", IntegerType, false)\r\n  )), false)\r\n))\r\n\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(rows, schema)\r\n\r\ndf\r\n  .select(when('cond, struct(lit(\"x\").as(\"val1\"), lit(10).as(\"val2\"))).otherwise('s) as \"res\")\r\n  .select('res.getField(\"val1\"))\r\n  .show()\r\n```\r\nException:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeWriter.write(UnsafeWriter.java:109)\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function - *schema_of_json()* which infers schema of JSON string literal. The result of the function is a string containing a schema in DDL format.\r\n\r\nOne of the use cases is using of *schema_of_json()* in the combination with *from_json()*. Currently, _from_json()_ requires a schema as a mandatory argument. The *schema_of_json()* function will allow to point out an JSON string as an example which has the same schema as the first argument of _from_json()_. For instance:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect from_json(json_column, schema_of_json('{\"c1\": [0], \"c2\": [{\"c3\":0}]}'))\r\nfrom json_table;\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test to `JsonFunctionsSuite`, `JsonExpressionsSuite` and SQL tests to `json-functions.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-01T10:03:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:34:55Z","closed_at":"2018-07-04T01:43:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9ba98c4d2ad3ffa72adbb51f702e61c8544e50f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc35731f4cd99c3687be486fcf15e9f9883cb139","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:infer_schema_json","ref":"infer_schema_json","sha":"dc35731f4cd99c3687be486fcf15e9f9883cb139","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

using async thread to avoid blocking kafka poll\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark Kafka RDD will block on kafka consumer poll. Specially in Spark-Kafka-streaming job this poll duration adds into batch processing time which result in \r\n\t* Increased batch processing time (which is apart from time taken to process records)\r\n\t* Results in unpredictable batch processing time based on poll time.\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of changes to maintain min records in buffer, so that streaming batches processing do not have to get blocked on kafka poll.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test / manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24699\r\n\r\nStructured streaming using `Trigger.Once` does not persist watermark state between batches, causing streams to never yield output. I will attach some scripts that reproduce this behavior in the Jira issue.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the microbatcher only calculates the watermark off of the previous batch's input and emits new aggs based off of that timestamp. I believe the issue here is that the previous batch state is not persisted to the checkpoint, and therefore cannot be used when the stream is started again with `Trigger.Once`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be seen when restarting a normal stream from checkpoint, output is never generated on the first batch.\r\n\r\nI will investigate ways of fixing this but I am definitely interested in input from anyone who worked on SS.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the watermarking should update with at least the batch-to-batch latency that it does under microbatch/Trigger.ProcessingTime.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFailing unit test provided.","created_at":"2018-06-29T23:05:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T20:25:22Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T20:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21694ed951559cd6b19805b0d302c40f54e66d9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c2e7fe80c4c53e757c373f76de37330d984f42e","head":{"label":"c-horn:SPARK-24699","ref":"SPARK-24699","sha":"9c2e7fe80c4c53e757c373f76de37330d984f42e","user":{"login":"c-horn","id":11586740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTg2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11586740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn","html_url":"https://github.com/c-horn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139201939,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkyMDE5Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"c-horn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c-horn","id":11586740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTg2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11586740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn","html_url":"https://github.com/c-horn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-horn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c-horn/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe ColumnPruning rule tries adding an extra Project if an input node produces fields more than needed, but as a post-processing step, it needs to remove the lower Project in the form of \"Project - Filter - Project\" otherwise it would conflict with PushPredicatesThroughProject and would thus cause a infinite optimization loop. The current post-processing method is defined as:\r\n```\r\n  private def removeProjectBeforeFilter(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan transform {\r\n    case p1 @ Project(_, f @ Filter(_, p2 @ Project(_, child)))\r\n      if p2.outputSet.subsetOf(child.outputSet) =>\r\n      p1.copy(child = f.copy(child = child))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis method works well when there is only one Filter but would not if there's two or more Filters. In this case, there is a deterministic filter and a non-deterministic filter so they stay as separate filter nodes and cannot be combined together.\r\n\r\nAn simplified illustration of the optimization process that forms the infinite loop is shown below (F1 stands for the 1st filter, F2 for the 2nd filter, P for project, S for scan of relation, PredicatePushDown as abbrev. of PushPredicatesThroughProject):\r\n```\r\n                             F1 - F2 - P - S\r\nPredicatePushDown      =>    F1 - P - F2 - S\r\nColumnPruning          =>    F1 - P - F2 - P - S\r\n                       =>    F1 - P - F2 - S        (Project removed)\r\nPredicatePushDown      =>    P - F1 - F2 - S\r\nColumnPruning          =>    P - F1 - P - F2 - S\r\n                       =>    P - F1 - P - F2 - P - S \r\n                       =>    P - F1 - F2 - P - S    (only one Project removed)\r\nRemoveRedundantProject =>    F1 - F2 - P - S        (goes back to the loop start)\r\n```\r\nSo the problem is the ColumnPruning rule adds a Project under a Filter (and fails to remove it in the end), and that new Project triggers PushPredicateThroughProject. Once the filters have been push through the Project, a new Project will be added by the ColumnPruning rule and this goes on and on.\r\nThe fix should be when adding Projects, the rule applies top-down, but later when removing extra Projects, the process should go bottom-up to ensure all extra Projects can be matched.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a optimization rule test in ColumnPruningSuite; and a end-to-end test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStreaming query reports progress during each trigger (e.g. after runBatch in MicrobatchExcecution). However the reported progress has wrong offsets since the offsets are first committed and committedOffsets is updated to the availableOffsets before the progress is reported.\r\n\r\nThis leads to weird progress where startOffset and endOffsets are always the same.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n \"id\" : \"76bf5515-55be-46af-bc79-9fc92cc6d856\",\r\n \"runId\" : \"b526f0f4-24bf-4ddc-b6e8-7b0cc83bdbe8\",\r\n...\r\n\"sources\" : [ {\r\n \"description\" : \"KafkaV2[Subscribe[topic2]]\",\r\n \"startOffset\" : {\r\n \"topic2\" : {\r\n \"0\" : 44\r\n }\r\n },\r\n \"endOffset\" : {\r\n \"topic2\" : {\r\n \"0\" : 44\r\n }\r\n },\r\n \"numInputRows\" : 11,\r\n \"inputRowsPerSecond\" : 1.099670098970309,\r\n \"processedRowsPerSecond\" : 1.8829168093118795\r\n } ],\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember the last committed offset before running the batch and updating the committed offsets and report the last committed offsets in the Streaming query progress.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Unit tests and running sample programs.\r\n\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen generating JSON the key is not just converted to a String now, instead the type is checked and for Dates and Timestamps the formatting happens first (if provided). When reading JSON, if the Schema says that a Map has a Date or Timestamp as the key then once again the formatting is done before the String is converted to the correct value for a Date or Timestamp.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have added Unit Tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

happens first (if provided).

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr proposes a new independent config so that `LogicalRelation` could use `rowCount` to compute data statistics in logical plans even if CBO disabled. In the master, we currently cannot enable `StarSchemaDetection.reorderStarJoins` because we need to turn off CBO to enable it but `StarSchemaDetection` internally references the `rowCount` that is used in LogicalRelation if CBO disabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPlan stats are pretty useful other than CBO, e.g., star-schema detector and dynamic partition pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21389,  data source schema is validated on driver side before launching read/write tasks.\r\nHowever,\r\n\r\n1. Putting all the validations together in `DataSourceUtils` is tricky and hard to maintain. On second thought after review, I find that the `OrcFileFormat` in hive package is not matched, so that its validation wrong.\r\n2.  `DataSourceUtils.verifyWriteSchema` and `DataSourceUtils.verifyReadSchema` is not supposed to be called in every file format. We can move them to some upper entry.\r\n\r\nSo, I propose we can add a new method `validateDataType` in FileFormat. File format implementation can override the method to specify its supported/non-supported data types. \r\nAlthough we should focus on data source V2 API, `FileFormat` should remain workable for some time. Adding this new method should be helpful. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-29T06:54:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T16:33:25Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T16:33:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"330faf9c15538ba4f24c6549d66130a5efc3fd68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13de60ec3916b8396e6fe04e755eeb7d70c54b3a","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:refactorSchemaValidate","ref":"refactorSchemaValidate","sha":"13de60ec3916b8396e6fe04e755eeb7d70c54b3a","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAn RDD is created using LabeledPoint, but the comment is like #LabeledPoint(feature, label).\r\nAlthough in the method ChiSquareTest.test, the second parameter is feature and the third parameter is label, it it better to write label in front of feature here because if an RDD is created using LabeldPoint, what we get are actually (label, feature) pairs.\r\nNow it is changed as LabeledPoint(label, feature).\r\n\r\nThe comments in Scala and Java example have the same typos.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `SPHINXPYTHON` environment variable to control the Python version used by Sphinx.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this environment variable is, it seems not properly rendering some signatures in the Python documentation when Python 2 is used by Sphinx. See the JIRA's case. It should be encouraged to use Python 3, but looks we will probably live with this problem for a long while in any event.\r\n\r\nFor the default case of `make html`, it keeps previous behaviour and use `SPHINXBUILD` as it was. If `SPHINXPYTHON` is set, then it forces Sphinx to use the specific Python version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXPYTHON=python3 make html\r\npython3 -msphinx -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx v1.7.5\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. if `SPHINXPYTHON` is set, use Python. If `SPHINXBUILD` is set, use sphinx-build.\r\n2. If both are set, `SPHINXBUILD` has a higher priority over `SPHINXPYTHON`\r\n3. By default, `SPHINXBUILD` is used as 'sphinx-build'.\r\n\r\nProbably, we can somehow work around this via explicitly setting `SPHINXBUILD` but `sphinx-build` can't be easily distinguished since it (at least in my environment and up to my knowledge) doesn't replace `sphinx-build` when newer Sphinx is installed in different Python version. It confuses and doesn't warn for its Python version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n**`python` (Python 2.7) in the path with Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make html\r\nsphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx v1.7.5\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`python` (Python 2.7) in the path without Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make html\r\nMakefile:8: *** The 'sphinx-build' command was not found. Make sure you have Sphinx installed, then set the SPHINXBUILD environment variable to point to the full path of the 'sphinx-build' executable. Alternatively you can add the directory with the executable to your PATH. If you don't have Sphinx installed, grab it from http://sphinx-doc.org/.  Stop.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**`SPHINXPYTHON` set `python` (Python 2.7)  with Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXPYTHON=python make html\r\nMakefile:35: *** Note that Python 3 is required to generate PySpark documentation correctly for now. Current Python executable was less than Python 3. See SPARK-24530. To force Sphinx to use a specific Python executable, please set SPHINXPYTHON to point to the Python 3 executable..  Stop.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`SPHINXPYTHON` set `python` (Python 2.7)  without Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXPYTHON=python make html\r\nMakefile:35: *** Note that Python 3 is required to generate PySpark documentation correctly for now. Current Python executable was less than Python 3. See SPARK-24530. To force Sphinx to use a specific Python executable, please set SPHINXPYTHON to point to the Python 3 executable..  Stop.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`SPHINXPYTHON` set `python3` with Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXPYTHON=python3 make html\r\npython3 -msphinx -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx v1.7.5\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`SPHINXPYTHON` set `python3` without Sphinx:**\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXPYTHON=python3 make html\r\nMakefile:39: *** Python executable 'python3' did not have Sphinx installed. Make sure you have Sphinx installed, then set the SPHINXPYTHON environment variable to point to the Python executable having Sphinx installed.

Stop.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**`SPHINXBUILD` set:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ SPHINXBUILD=sphinx-build make html\r\nsphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx

Speculative tasks that didn't commit can show up as success (depending on timing of commit). This is a bit confusing because that task didn't really succeed in the sense it didn't write anything.\r\nI think these tasks should be marked as KILLED or something that is more obvious to the user exactly what happened. it is happened to hit the timing where it got a commit denied exception then it shows up as failed and counts against your task failures. It shouldn't count against task failures since that failure really doesn't matter.\r\nMapReduce handles these situation so perhaps we can look there for a model.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1420\" alt=\"unknown\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15680678/42013170-99db48c2-7a61-11e8-8c7b-ef94c84e36ea.png\">\r\n\r\n**How can this issue happen?**\r\nWhen both attempts of a task finish before the driver sends command to kill one of them, both of them send the status update FINISHED to the driver. The driver calls TaskSchedulerImpl to handle one successful task at a time. When it handles the first successful task, it sends the command to kill the other copy of the task, however, because that task is already finished, the executor will ignore the command. After finishing handling the first attempt, it processes the second one, although all actions on the result of this task are skipped, this copy of the task is still marked as SUCCESS. As a result, even though this issue does not affect the result of the job, it might cause confusing to user because both of them appear to be successful.\r\n\r\n**How does this PR fix the issue?**\r\nThe simple way to fix this issue is that when taskSetManager handles successful task, it checks if any other attempt succeeded. If this is the case, it will call handleFailedTask with state==KILLED and reason==TaskKilled(“another attempt succeeded”) to handle this task as begin killed.\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nI tested this manually by running applications, that caused the issue before, a few times, and observed that the issue does not happen again. Also, I added a unit test in TaskSetManagerSuite to test that if we call handleSuccessfulTask to handle status update for 2 copies of a task, only the one that is handled first will be mark as SUCCESS\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-28T04:29:58Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T17:37:59Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T17:37:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e171aaedd0c2a43d8c9d1a47dbc40b0f814f928","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6585da0f137d3d3675925368c4668c884de900c","head":{"label":"hthuynh2:SPARK_13343","ref":"SPARK_13343","sha":"b6585da0f137d3d3675925368c4668c884de900c","user":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136668094,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY2NjgwOTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"hthuynh2/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, sinks only have access to the batchId and the data, not the actual offset representation.\r\nThe goal of this PR is to expose this representation to sinks via ```addBatch```. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests (needs to be changed to also test for offsetSeqs)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `GenericArrayData.equals`, so that it respects the actual types of the elements.\r\ne.g. an instance that represents an `array<int>` and another instance that represents an `array<long>` should be considered incompatible, and thus should return false for `equals`.\r\n\r\n`GenericArrayData` doesn't keep any schema information by itself, and rather relies on the Java objects referenced by its `array` field's elements to keep track of their own object types. So, the most straightforward way to respect their types is to call `equals` on the elements, instead of using Scala's `==` operator, which can have semantics that are not always desirable:\r\n```\r\nnew java.lang.Integer(123) == new java.lang.Long(123L) // true in Scala\r\nnew java.lang.Integer(123).equals(new java.lang.Long(123L)) // false in Scala\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test in `ComplexDataSuite`","created_at":"2018-06-26T11:08:43Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T05:27:31Z","closed_at":"2018-06-27T02:32:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8042a639540c3fa68e2a9aa19625a16283cb1205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a30de22183cab3cde90fce6029cd03dfc5b5758a","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:fix-genericarraydata-equals","ref":"fix-genericarraydata-equals","sha":"a30de22183cab3cde90fce6029cd03dfc5b5758a","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

lots of work to track down again all the license requirements, but this ought to be a pretty good pass. Below, find a writeup on how I approached it for future reference.\r\n\r\n- LICENSE and NOTICE and licenses/ now reflect the *source* release\r\n- LICENSE-binary and NOTICE-binary and licenses-binary now reflect the binary release\r\n- Recreated all the license info from scratch\r\n- Added notes about how this was constructed for next time\r\n- License-oriented info was moved from NOTICE to LICENSE, esp. for Cat B deps\r\n- Some seemingly superfluous or stale license info was removed, especially for test-scope deps\r\n- Updated release script to put binary-oriented versions in binary releases\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Principles\r\n\r\nASF projects distribute source and binary code under the Apache License 2.0. However these project distributions frequently include copies of source or binary code from third parties, under possibly other license terms. This triggers conditions of those licenses, which essentially amount to including license information in a LICENSE and/or NOTICE file, and including copies of license texts (here, in a directory called `license/`). \r\n\r\nSee http://www.apache.org/dev/licensing-howto.html and https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#required-third-party-notices \r\n\r\n# In Spark\r\n\r\nSpark produces source releases, and also binary releases of that code. Spark source code may contain source from third parties, possibly modified. This is true in Scala, Java, Python and R, and in the UI's JavaScript and CSS files. These must be handled appropriately per above in a LICENSE and NOTICE file created for the source release.\r\n\r\nSeparately, the binary releases may contain binary code from third parties. This is very much true for Scala and Java, as Spark produces an 'assembly' binary release which includes all transitive binary dependencies of this part of Spark. With perhaps the exception of py4j, this doesn't occur in the same way for Python or R because of the way these ecosystems work. (Note that the JS and CSS for the UI will be in both 'source' and 'binary' releases.) These must also be handled in a separate LICENSE and NOTICE file for the binary release.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Binary Release License\r\n\r\n## Transitive Maven Dependencies\r\n\r\nWe'll first tackle the binary release, and that almost entirely means assessing the transitive dependencies of the Scala/Java backbone of Spark.\r\n\r\nRun `project-info-reports:dependencies` with essentially all profiles: a set that would bring in all different possible transitive dependencies. However, don't activate any of the '-lgpl' profiles as these would bring in LGPL-licensed dependencies that are explicitly excluded from Spark binary releases.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn -Phadoop-2.7 -Pyarn -Phive -Pmesos -Pkubernetes -Pflume -Pkinesis-asl -Pdocker-integration-tests -Phive-thriftserver -Pkafka-0-8 -Ddependency.locations.enabled=false project-info-reports:dependencies\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen `assembly/target/site/dependencies.html`. Find \"Project Transitive Dependencies\", and find \"compile\" and \"runtime\" (if exists). This is a list of all the dependencies that Spark is going to ship in its binary \"assembly\" distro and therefore whose licenses need to be appropriately considered in LICENSE and NOTICE. Copy this table into a spreadsheet for easy management.\r\n\r\nNext job is to fill in some blanks, as a few projects will not have clearly declared their licenses in a POM. Sort by license.\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to verify all the dependencies are at least Cat A/B licenses, and not Cat X! http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html\r\n\r\n### Apache License 2\r\n\r\nThe Apache License 2 variants are typically easiest to deal with as they will not require you to modify LICENSE, nor add to license/. It's still good form to list the ALv2 dependencies in LICENSE for completeness, but optional.\r\n\r\nThey may require you to propagate bits from NOTICE. It's tedious to track down all the NOTICE files and evaluate what if anything needs to be copied to NOTICE.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this can be made easier as the assembly module can be temporarily modified to produce a NOTICE file that concatenates all NOTICE files bundled with transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nFirst change the packaging of `assembly/spark-assembly_2.11/pom.xml` to `<packaging>jar</packaging>`. Next add this stanza somewhere in the body of the same POM file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<plugin>\r\n  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>\r\n  <configuration>\r\n    <shadedArtifactAttached>false</shadedArtifactAttached>\r\n    <artifactSet>\r\n      <includes>\r\n        <include>*:*</include>\r\n      </includes>\r\n    </artifactSet>\r\n  </configuration>\r\n  <executions>\r\n    <execution>\r\n      <phase>package</phase>\r\n      <goals>\r\n        <goal>shade</goal>\r\n      </goals>\r\n      <configuration>\r\n        <transformers>\r\n          <transformer implementation=\"org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ApacheNoticeResourceTransformer\"/>\r\n        </transformers>\r\n      </configuration>\r\n    </execution>\r\n  </executions>\r\n</plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally execute `mvn ... package` with all of the same `-P` profile flags as above. In the JAR file at `assembly/target/spark-assembly_2.11....jar` you'll find a file `META-INF/NOTICE` that concatenates all NOTICE files bundled with transitive dependencies. This should be the starting point for the binary release's NOTICE file.\r\n\r\nSome elements in the file are from Spark itself, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpark Project Assembly\r\nCopyright 2018 The Apache Software Foundation\r\n\r\nSpark Project Core\r\nCopyright 2018 The Apache Software Foundation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese can be removed.\r\n\r\nRemove elements of the combined NOTICE file that aren't relevant to Spark. It's actually rare that we are sure that some element is completely irrelevant to Spark, because each transitive dependency includes all its transitive dependencies. So there may be nothing that can be done here.\r\n\r\nOf course, some projects may not publish NOTICE in their Maven artifacts. Ideally, search for the NOTICE file of projects that don't seem to have produced any text in NOTICE, but, there is some argument that projects that don't produce a NOTICE in their Maven artifacts don't entail an obligation on projects that depend solely on their Maven artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Other Licenses\r\n\r\nNext are \"Cat A\" permissively licensed (BSD 2-Clause, BSD 3-Clause, MIT) components. List the components grouped by their license type in LICENSE. Then add the text of the license to licenses/. For example if you list \"foo bar\" as a BSD-licensed dependency, add its license text as licenses/LICENSE-foo-bar.txt.\r\n\r\nPublic domain and similar works are treated like permissively licensed dependencies.\r\n\r\nAnd the same goes for all Cat B licenses too, like CDDL. However these additional require at least a URL pointer to the project's page. Use the artifact hyperlink in your spreadsheet if possible; if non-existent or doesn't resolve, do your best to determine a URL for the project's source.\r\n\r\n### Shaded third-party dependencies\r\n\r\nSome third party dependencies actually copy in other dependencies rather than depend on them as Maven artifacts. This means they don't show up in the process above. These can be quite hard to track down, but are rare. A key example is reflectasm, embedded in kryo.\r\n\r\n### Examples module\r\n\r\nThe above _almost_ considers everything bundled in a Spark binary release. The main assembly won't include examples. The same must be done for dependencies marked as 'compile' for the examples module. See `examples/target/site/dependencies.html`. At the time of this writing however this just adds one dependency: `scopt`.\r\n\r\n### provided scope\r\n\r\nAbove we considered just compile and runtime scope dependencies, which makes sense as they are the ones that are packaged. However, for complicated reasons (shading), a few components that Spark does bundle are not marked as compile dependencies in the assembly. Therefore it's also necessary to consider 'provided' dependencies from `assembly/target/site/dependencies.html` actually! Right now that's just Jetty and JPMML artifacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Python, R\r\n\r\nDon't forget that Py4J is also distributed in the binary release, actually. There should be no other R, Python code in the binary release. That's it.\r\n\r\n## Sense checking\r\n\r\nCompare the contents of `jars/`, `examples/jars/` and `python/lib` from a recent binary release to see if anything appears there that doesn't seem to have been covered above. These additional components will have to be handled manually, but should be few or none of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Source Release License\r\n\r\nWhile there are relatively fewer third-party source artifacts included as source code, there is no automated way to detect it, really. It requires some degree of manual auditing. Most third party source comes from included JS and CSS files.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing, some places to look or consider: `build/sbt-launch-lib.bash`, `python/lib`, third party source in `python/pyspark` like `heapq3.py`, `docs/js/vendor`, and `core/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ui/static`.\r\n\r\nThe principles are the same as above.\r\n\r\nRemember some JS files copy in other JS files! Look out for Modernizr.\r\n\r\n# One More Thing: JS and CSS in Binary Release\r\n\r\nNow that you've got a handle on source licenses, recall that all the JS and CSS source code will *also* be part of the binary release. Copy that info from source to binary license files accordingly.","created_at":"2018-06-25T22:11:07Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T16:47:13Z","closed_at":"2018-07-01T00:32:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"643116bdd2d99b332eed64d7cd83570036493ce8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/198b2082019d0a17ea327d03816cc7d496df7443","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-24654","ref":"SPARK-24654","sha":"198b2082019d0a17ea327d03816cc7d496df7443","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

is a narrow race in this code that is caused when the code being\r\nrun in assertSpilled / assertNotSpilled runs more than a single job.\r\n\r\nSpillListener assumed that only a single job was run, and so would only\r\nblock waiting for that single job to finish when `numSpilledStages` was\r\ncalled. But some tests (like SQL tests that call `checkAnswer`) run more\r\nthan one job, and so that wait was basically a no-op.\r\n\r\nThis could cause the next test to install a listener to receive events\r\nfrom the previous job. Which could cause test failures in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe change fixes that race, and also uninstalls listeners after the\r\ntest runs, so they don't accumulate when the SparkContext is shared\r\namong multiple tests.","created_at":"2018-06-25T22:06:08Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T19:54:06Z","closed_at":"2018-08-01T07:51:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95458cf503f9484cfdc1ac7f6d852c2a61910507","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18d5ebfd201deaebf774835ec5eb08d2b6d08454","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-24653","ref":"SPARK-24653","sha":"18d5ebfd201deaebf774835ec5eb08d2b6d08454","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR metrics are introduced for YARN.  As up to now there was no metrics in the YARN module a new metric system is created with the name \"applicationMaster\".\r\nTo support both client and cluster mode the metric system lifecycle is bound to the AM. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBoth client and cluster mode was tested manually. \r\nBefore the test on one of the YARN node spark-core was removed to cause the allocation failure. \r\nSpark was started as (in case of client mode): \r\n\r\n```\r\nspark2-submit \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n  --conf \"spark.yarn.blacklist.executor.launch.blacklisting.enabled=true\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.application.maxFailedExecutorsPerNode=2\" --conf \"spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true\" --conf \"spark.metrics.conf.*.sink.console.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.ConsoleSink\" \\\r\n  --master yarn \\\r\n  --deploy-mode client \\\r\n  original-spark-examples_2.11-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n  1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases the YARN logs contained the new metrics as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ yarn logs --applicationId application_1529926424933_0015 \r\n...\r\n-- Gauges ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\napplication_1531751594108_0046.applicationMaster.numContainersPendingAllocate\r\n             value =

is updated PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16722 to latest master\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for sample weights to DecisionTreeRegressor and DecisionTreeClassifier.\r\n\r\nNote: This patch does not add support for sample weights to RandomForest. As discussed in the JIRA, we would like to add sample weights into the bagging process. This patch is large enough as is, and there are some additional considerations to be made for random forests. Since the machinery introduced here needs to be present regardless, I have opted to leave random forests for a follow up pr.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe algorithms are tested to ensure that:\r\n    1. Arbitrary scaling of constant weights has no effect\r\n    2. Outliers with small weights do not affect the learned model\r\n    3. Oversampling and weighting are equivalent\r\n\r\nUnit tests are also added to test other smaller components.\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\n   - Impurity aggregators now store weighted sufficient statistics. They also store a raw count, however, since this is needed to use minInstancesPerNode.\r\n\r\n   - Impurity aggregators now also hold the raw count.\r\n\r\n   - This patch maintains the meaning of minInstancesPerNode, in that the parameter still corresponds to raw, unweighted counts. It also adds a new parameter minWeightFractionPerNode which requires that nodes must contain at least minWeightFractionPerNode * weightedNumExamples total weight.\r\n\r\n   - This patch modifies findSplitsForContinuousFeatures to use weighted sums. Unit tests are added.\r\n\r\n   - TreePoint is modified to hold a sample weight\r\n\r\n   - BaggedPoint is modified from:\r\n``` Scala\r\nprivate[spark] class BaggedPoint[Datum](val datum: Datum, val subsampleWeights: Array[Double]) extends Serializable\r\n```\r\nto\r\n``` Scala\r\nprivate[spark] class BaggedPoint[Datum](\r\n    val datum: Datum,\r\n    val subsampleCounts: Array[Int],\r\n    val sampleWeight: Double) extends Serializable\r\n```\r\nWe do not simply multiply the counts by the weight and store that because we need the raw counts and the weight in order to use both minInstancesPerNode and minWeightPerNode\r\n\r\n**Note**: many of the changed files are due simply to using Instance instead of
