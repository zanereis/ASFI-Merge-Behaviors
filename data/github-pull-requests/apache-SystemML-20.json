is a standing PR to facilitate discussion on whether or not, we should support native BLAS in SystemML. After discussion and after resolving the issues with deployment, we can decide whether to turn on this feature by default. Since I wanted feedback from community before proceeding ahead, I did not complete the PR. The remaining tasks are:\r\n\r\n- Generalize to other BLAS, not just MKL. This would also involve completing the CMake file.\r\n- Add other operations: conv2d_backward_*, etc.\r\n\r\nI ran some preliminary performance experiments comparing conv2d with/without sparse+caching and with/without native BLAS. I provided fairly large memory budget (-Xmx20g -Xms20g -Xmn2048m -server) and used Open JDK 1.8 64-Bit Server VM. The script tested the performance of conv2d using four commonly used setups for 1000 iterations:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmax_iterations = 1000\r\nsetup = $2\r\nnumFilters = -1\r\nnumChannels = -1\r\nfilterSize = -1\r\npad = -1\r\nif(setup == 1) {\r\n        numFilters = 20\r\n        numChannels = 1\r\n        filterSize = 5\r\n        pad = 0\r\n}\r\nelse if(setup == 2) {\r\n        numFilters = 50\r\n        numChannels = 20\r\n        filterSize = 5\r\n        pad = 0\r\n}\r\nelse if(setup == 3) {\r\n        numFilters = 20\r\n        numChannels = 1\r\n        filterSize = 3\r\n        pad = 1\r\n}\r\nelse if(setup == 4) {\r\n        numFilters = 50\r\n        numChannels = 20\r\n        filterSize = 3\r\n        pad = 1\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n        stop('Incorrect setup (needs to be [1, 4]).')\r\n}\r\nimgSize = 28\r\nn = 60000\r\nX = rand(rows=n, cols=numChannels*imgSize*imgSize)\r\nbatch_size = 64\r\nw = rand(rows=numFilters, cols=numChannels*filterSize*filterSize)\r\nP = (imgSize + 2 * pad - filterSize)  + 1\r\nfoo = matrix(0, rows=n, cols=numFilters*P*P)\r\nfor(iter in 1:max_iterations) {\r\n        beg = (iter * batch_size) %% n + 1\r\n        end = min(n, beg + batch_size)\r\n        X_batch = X[beg:end, ]\r\n        n_batch = nrow(X_batch)\r\n        convOut_1 = conv2d(X_batch, w, input_shape=[n_batch,numChannels,imgSize,imgSize], filter_shape=[numFilters,numChannels,filterSize,filterSize], padding=[pad,pad], stride=[1,1])\r\n        foo = convOut_1\r\n}\r\nprint(sum(foo))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo compile the native SystemML library, please use:\r\n```bash\r\nexport MKLROOT=/opt/intel/mkl\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=....\r\n# Please go to https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor to find LINKER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_OPTIONS\r\nexport LINKER_OPTIONS=\" -L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -Wl,--no-as-needed -lmkl_rt -lpthread -lm -ldl\"\r\nexport COMPILER_OPTIONS=\" -m64 -I${MKLROOT}/include\"\r\ng++ -shared -fPIC -o libsystemml.so systemml.cpp -I. -I$JAVA_HOME/include -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux -lm -fopenmp -O3 $LINKER_OPTIONS $COMPILER_OPTIONS \r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see below the results of the experiments. Both sparse and caching are disabled for the setup `SystemML_native` and `SystemML_CP`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n,Number of Iterations, Setup, Time in seconds\r\nSystemML_native,1000,1,7.103096398\r\nSystemML_CP,1000,1,6.498525426\r\nSystemML_CP_WithCacheNSparseEnabled,1000,1,7.195620854\r\nTensorflow,1000,1,4.071731716\r\nSystemML_native,1000,2,31.315343223\r\nSystemML_CP,1000,2,81.769984552\r\nSystemML_CP_WithCacheNSparseEnabled,1000,2,101.274622939\r\nTensorflow,1000,2,33.476548341\r\nSystemML_native,1000,3,7.662274848\r\nSystemML_CP,1000,3,6.355272119\r\nSystemML_CP_WithCacheNSparseEnabled,1000,3,7.607337158\r\nTensorflow,1000,3,3.837932081\r\nSystemML_native,1000,4,26.638438614\r\nSystemML_CP,1000,4,49.716594505\r\nSystemML_CP_WithCacheNSparseEnabled,1000,4,71.542244484\r\nTensorflow,1000,4,26.395180006\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some additional overhead cost (such as initial compilation/validation, reuse of previously allocated but non-zeroed array, dynamic recompilation, GC, etc) which we have not yet optimized. These cost are beyond the scope of this PR and some of them are inherent to our design principles. We can work on them in a separate PR :)\r\n\r\n@mboehm7 @bertholdreinwald @dusenberrymw @frreiss @prithvirajsen @fschueler @nakul02 @asurve   @deroneriksson   I understand the above experiments might not be sufficient to accept the change and would welcome your feedback on additional experiments/setups. I would also appreciate if some of you are willing to help me with these experiments too ;)\r\n\r\nHere are the shapes of the matrix multiplication for the four setups:\r\n```bash\r\nSetup 1:\r\n64 parallel matrix multiplication of shape (20, 25) %*% (25, 576) executed 1000 times.\r\n \r\nSetup 2:\r\n64 parallel matrix multiplication of shape (50, 500) %*% (500, 576) executed 1000 times.\r\n \r\nSetup 3:\r\n64 parallel matrix multiplication of shape (20, 25) %*% (25, 784) executed 1000 times.\r\n \r\nSetup 4:\r\n64 parallel matrix multiplication of shape (50, 500) %*% (500, 784) executed 1000 times.\r\n```\r\nI will provide an update soon comparing the results of the above matrix multiplications.

However, having this flag allows an educated user to disable them (for example: deep learning).\r\n3. Bug fix for single-threaded execution for conv2d_backward_filter.\r\n4. Cleaned up the code for reuse non-zeroed array and invocation of ConvTasks. \r\n5. Updated developer documentation for LibMatrixDNN.\r\n6. Added sparse test cases for conv2d.

issue relates directly to the version of R in use.  R versions 3.3+ encounter the coercion issue displaying the following message:\r\n```\r\nStandard Error from R:Error in as(B, \"CsparseMatrix\") : \r\n  no method or default for coercing “table” to “CsparseMatrix”\r\nCalls: writeMM -> as\r\n```\r\nIt appears that R has fixed implicit coercion such that the following statements now (in R 3.3+) return a table rather than a matrix.\r\n```\r\nB1 = table (IA, VA);\r\nB2 = as.matrix(as.data.frame.matrix(B1));\r\nB = B1[2:nrow(B2),2:ncol(B2)];\r\nwriteMM(as(B, \"CsparseMatrix\"), paste(args[2], \"B\", sep=\"\"));\r\n```\r\nThis results a table coercion exception when attempting to write B as a CsparseMatrix.\r\nThe fix is to use the matrix B2 when creating variable B.  This will result in B getting treated as a matrix rather than a table.\r\n```\r\nB = B2[2:nrow(B2),2:ncol(B2)];\r\n```\r\nThis suggests that R improved (or fixed) the handling of the assignment of B such that it now (in 3.3+) preserves the table datatype upon

PR updates systemml to use cuda 8 and cudnn 5.1.\r\nUse has been significantly simplified compared to the steps listed [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/docs/devdocs/gpu-backend.md).\r\n\r\nThe user need only invoke maven to make the package and the cuda native shared libraries will be available wrapped in jars in the classpath without the need to set any environment variables or extra java options. (tested on a Centos 7 x86_64 system).\r\n\r\nmavenized-jcuda and jcuda packages have been excluded in the shade plugin to stop them from being included in the package. This decision can be revisited in the future.\r\n\r\nNote - This is a WIP. We still await the availability of a repo from where we can fetch mavenized-jcuda with cuda 8.

Bumped up the Python package version number @deroneriksson \r\n\r\n- Allow SystemML matrix to be invoked by numpy methods ( @dusenberrymw  ):\r\n```python\r\nimport systemml as sml\r\nimport numpy as

suggestion).\r\n```python\r\n>>> import systemml as sml\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> m1 = sml.matrix(np.ones((3,3)) + 2)\r\n\r\nWelcome to Apache SystemML!\r\n\r\n>>> m2 =

To fetch the NumPy array, invoke toNumPyArray() method.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFew caveats:\r\n- The current version of NumPy explicitly disables overriding `ufunc`, but this should be enabled in next release. Until then to test above code, please use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/niketanpansare/numpy.git\r\ncd numpy\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Following NumPy ufunc that are not yet implemented in SystemML's Python DSL:\r\n```bash\r\nconj, hyperbolic/inverse-hyperbolic functions(i.e. sinh, arcsinh, cosh, ...), bitwise operator, xor operator, isreal, iscomplex, isfinite, isinf, isnan, copysign, nextafter, modf, frexp,

decisions:\n1.  In the initial version, I decided not to parse and walk the Python AST. The key assumption is that the **code to be pushed-down has to map to PyDML**. This will help us to identify the gaps in PyDML as well (for example: `dot(H, H.transpose())` instead of `H.dot(H.transpose))`. Also, cases such as `sml.matrix` is not handled.\n2. The inputs and outputs need to be specified. There is a tradeoff here between **simplicity of the API+Implementation and optimization scope**. \n- Alternative to the current implementation is that inputs+outputs are not specified and the function to be pushed-down has access to all the variables in the global scope. In this case, we walk down the AST and identify all the variables on RHS and treat them as outputs and all other variables not created as input (hand-waving lil bit here). \n- Another alternative is to not require providing variable name in string format: `'H'`, but this was difficult  to implement due to pass-by-value and point 1.\n- Also, I could not find a way to enable the decorator (`@parallelize`) on statement block instead of function.\n\n``` python\nimport systemml as sml\nfrom systemml import random\nsml.setSparkContext(sc)\n\nm, n = 100, 20\nk = 40\nV = sml.random.uniform(size=(m, n))\nW = sml.random.uniform(size=(m, k))\nH = sml.random.uniform(size=(k, n))\n\n@sml.parallelize\ndef push_down_loop(inputs, outputs):\n    max_iters = 200\n    for i in range(0, max_iters):\n        H = H * dot(W.transpose(), V)/dot(W.transpose(), dot(W, H))\n        W = W * dot(V, H.transpose())/dot(W, dot(H, H.transpose()))\n\n# The returned values as Matrix class\nret = push_down_loop(inputs={'H': H, 'W':W, 'V': V}, outputs=['H', 'W'])\nH = ret[0].toNumPy()\nW = ret[1].toNumPy()\n```\n\n@iyounus @dusenberrymw @mboehm7 @frreiss @bertholdreinwald @nakul02

Tanuj surveyed the CuBLAS libraries and implemented LibMatrixCUDA methods. These methods map SystemML operations to CuBLAS calls similar to LibMatrixCUDA.matmult(). Here are the list of methods: transpose, cellwiseMatMatAddSub, matScalarElementwiseMultDiv and vectorScalarMult. In subsequent PR, we will implement remaining binary operations using custom kernels (i.e. phase 2). \n2. Also, added initial support for invoking custom kernels in preparation for phase 2. This relies of custom kernels compiled into ptx format and included as resource file. Since ptx format are target-independent, the kernels can be supported for different GPU versions. The utility\n   org.apache.sysml.runtime.instructions.gpu.context.JCudaKernels simplifies the launching of the kernels. For example: to launch a kernel `copyUpperToLowerTriangleDense<<1,1,32,32>>(jcudaDenseMatrixPtr, dim, dim*dim)`, the user has to call: `kernels.launchKernel(\"copyUpperToLowerTriangleDense\", new\n   ExecutionConfig(1,1,32,32), jcudaDenseMatrixPtr, dim, dim*dim)`.\n3. Also fixed a GPU bufferpool bug (setting of dirty flag).\n4. Implemented sparseToDense() and denseToSparse() methods in JCudaObject similar to MatrixBlock.\n\n@nakul02 @bertholdreinwald @taasawat
