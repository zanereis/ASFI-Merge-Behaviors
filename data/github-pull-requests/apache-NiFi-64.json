can be built and run on Java 11.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to establish general build compatibility for Java 11 while retaining complete build and runtime validity for Java 8.\r\n\r\nTODOs/needed fixes will be added here.\r\n\r\nCurrent status:\r\n\r\n- [x] NiFi can be built on Java 11\r\n- [x] NiFi starts successfully on Java 11\r\n- [ ] Several standard processors have been tested, and work.  Should an exhaustive list be supplied?\r\n- [x] Provenance events displaying properly in the Provenance UI\r\n- [ ] Processors using Ignite dependencies will most likely not work on Java 11.  A release of the Ignite dependencies compatible with Java 11 has not yet been made\r\n- [ ] JMS processors may not work.  ActiveMQ 5.15.8 does not run on Java 11.  Compatibility with Java 11 is expected in release version 5.16.0 of ActiveMQ.\r\n- [x] Tests that use TLS often fail when specifying a protocal version of `TLS` or `TLSv1.3` in tests during the Java 11 build, need to investigate and resolve in a follow-on PR. For now, the tests explicitly use `TLSv1.2`.\r\n\r\nThings to test with this PR:\r\n- Building on Java 8 and running on Java 8\r\n- Building on Java 8 and running on Java 11\r\n- Building on Java 11 and running on Java 11\r\n\r\nNote: When building, to work around `TestJdbcCommon` timezone issues (which also occur on master), add `-Duser.timezone=UTC` to the mvn command when building.\r\n\r\nFor the three build/run scenarios above:\r\n- Verify running securely with certs generated by the TLS Toolkit\r\n- Verify functionality with reverse proxies\r\n- Verify processors, controller services, reporting tasks work\r\n- Use TLSv1.2 explicitly\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR isn't to fix _every_ issue running on Java 11, but it should not introduce any new issues for building on Java 8 and running the Java 8 build on Java 8 or 11.\r\n\r\nFollow-on PRs can be created to fix issues encountered while running on Java 11 for specific

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPersonal Notes: \r\n\r\nI would pay particular attention to TailFile.java as I had to modify the TestRunner including an option for without validation for one of the tests.  I'm very uncertain about that. \r\n\r\nI did do a pull from master to capture upstream changes before making this draft PR but I did not rebase as recommended. \r\n\r\nI also ran a mvn clean install and verified a successful build but I did not run with the contrib-check flag set.  \r\n\r\nI still have a bit more work remaining on this.\r\n\r\nAfter submitting this request I will be re-running the build with contrib check.

the FlowFile Repository, we do not decrement claimant counts for any FlowFiles that were removed. Doing so can cause an issue where a FlowFile is removed, then the FlowFileRepo update fails, resulting in the flowfile being rolled back, but after its claimant count is decremented. It will then be processed again, which can result in the same thing, and we'll end up decrementing the claimant count repeatedly. Also updated LengthDelimitedJournal so that if the overflow directory already exists, it does not fail when trying to create the directory and instead just moves on. Updated unit tests to test both of these new fixes and updated DummyRecordSerde to be thread-safe because the TestLengthDelimitedJournal now needs it to be thread safe due to the new unit test that was added.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the nifi-fn PR that was supplied in PR 3241 to make proper use of ClassLoader isolation for Processors and Controller Services, as well as separating nifi-fn project into a few sub-projects, so that nifi-fn is itself encapsulated as a NAR. Added LICENSE/NOTICE files. Performed some refactoring to make the sub-modules work and also was able to make slight refactoring to avoid depending on nifi-framework-core. Rebased against latest master and updated to version 1.10.0-SNAPSHOT instead of 1.9.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nAlso updated README to better explain how to use the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T18:09:18Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T17:03:20Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T17:03:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d84c0add77d7acf4f597921b80b37fbafdda94a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/ada3babba8a15aa09e38e118f5867451b96c18b6","head":{"label":"markap14:nifi-fn","ref":"nifi-fn","sha":"ada3babba8a15aa09e38e118f5867451b96c18b6","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52380182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjM4MDE4Mg==","name":"nifi","full_name":"markap14/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markap14/nifi","description":"Mirror

Guys\r\n\r\nThis change is a PoC of user-controlled enabling Expression Language for the current NiFi. You can test it, but seems this approach will never be completed because of compatibility issues (it adds additional `PropertyDescriptor` field `forceEl` that saved into the flow/template).\r\n\r\nHopefully this one will help someone else to setup CICD for NiFi flows properly.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

If multiple FlowFiles were written to same Content Claim, and a Processor attempted to read two of them wi within a single session, it would seek to the wrong part of the content or else throw a ContentNotFoundException.
