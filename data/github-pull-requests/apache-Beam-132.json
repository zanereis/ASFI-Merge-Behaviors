PR adds `GroupIntoTransform.WithShardedKey` to the runner api as a well-known composite transform and also adds the non-sharded version `GroupIntoBatches` as a component there of. This allows runners to recognize and choose the sharding approach for `GroupIntoTransform.WithShardedKey`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a Dataflow override of `GroupIntoTransform.WithShardedKey` in Python for non-portable job submission, analogous to the Java implementation (#13208). For portable job submission, the changes will be done in the Dataflow service instead of in SDK.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

removes some unused options from launcher, fixes the justModelResultRate mode by fixing the formatting string, uses the right name for the SessionSideInputJoin and renames the argument in one launcher option, just for consistency.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the unused options could break some test setups somewhere, but I see this as a minimal concern. It will not affect any production pipelines and the amount of people regularly running the NEXMark benchmark with old unused options. Alternative is to use the `@Hidden` annotation and note in the docstrings that they are not in use.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR modifies `PartitioningSession` so it re-executes expressions with a variety of partitioned inputs, determined by the expression's `requires_partition_by` specification. It also verifies that the output for each type of partitioned input is partitioned consistent with the expression's `preserves_partition_by` specification.\r\n\r\nThis detected the issue fixed in

PR adds logging for the build history url in the case the google cloud build run failed, and also enables kaniko cache for better build performance as https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/kaniko-cache suggested. Experiment shows with kaniko cache, the build time for is greatly reduced after initial build. This helps user to launch job faster with prebuilt python sdk workflow.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

and ZetaSQL have different ways of handling UNNEST an array of struct type. In order to not break CalciteSQL dialect, enable different rules and rels for ZetaSQL dialect:\r\n\r\n- `ZetaSqlUnnest` to replace Calcite `Uncollect`\r\n- `BeamZetaSqlUncollectRel` to replace Calcite `BeamUncollectRel` (uncorrelated case)\r\n- `BeamZetaSqlUncollectRule` to replace Calcite `BeamUncollectRule` (uncorrelated case)\r\n- `BeamZetaSqlUnnestRel` to replace Calcite `BeamUnnestRel` (correlated case)\r\n- `BeamZetaSqlUnnestRule` to replace Calcite `BeamUnnestRule` (correlated case)\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary solution before we upgrade vendored Calcite to >= 1.23.0. After upgrade we may use the \"set struct alias\" feature to simplify the solution.

is meant to be part of a larger change adding unit tests for the various pipeline transformations in graphx/xlang.go.\r\n\r\nAfter how long it took to figure out how to implement this, and the realization that each other transformation is going to be similarly difficult and they're already somewhat tested by the xlang examples (and soon-to-be integration tests), I think I'd rather not implement the rest anymore. But I already implemented most of this test so I just finished it up and am sending it out in a PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

introduces a bug where the algorithm that determines the parents of fused stage can create loops, because the lowest common ancestor algorithm considers a transform to be its own parent. Fusing a single transform A will result cause the fused stage's parent to be set to A. Fusing a transform A with a descendant B will also cause fused stage's parent to be set to A. To fix this, if the parent of the fused stage would be one of transforms to be fused, set the parent to the parent of that transform instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a cherry pick of #13303.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

haven't found evidence that this is the cause but I strongly suspect the cause of the NPE on this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/43e8b990b19d9ad3031b06e3c3dea508d0916d93/sdks/java/harness/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/logging/BeamFnLoggingClientTest.java#L162\r\nis that the `Logger` corresponding to `\"ConfiguredLogger\"` has been GC'd. The javadoc for `Logger.getLogger` notes:\r\n\r\n> Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any time if there is no strong reference to the Logger.\r\n\r\nOnce the client is closed the only reference to the logger is removed and there's the possibility it gets GC'd before we try to access it for the assertion.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes warning suppression in BeamFnLoggingClient.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK |

jobs were failing, rarely, when attempting to delete the container image because the container was not removed first. This is likely due to a race between shutting down the container and removing the container image. Since this is a test, it is safe to force remove the image and assume the container will be shutdown properly.\r\n\r\nIf there is actually a problem here with the containers not shutting down, it should manifest as a memory related exception on the Jenkins agent and be quite a spectacular failure (i.e. easy to notice).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue of BEAM-10921 was clearing the InteractiveEnvironment when other tests were running. This caused the flakiness. Fixing this, it was shown that getting the user_pipeline was broken due to an incorrect assumption that PCollection proto IDs were unique across all pipelines. After fixing this, I found that the pipeline.py clobbers the pipeline reference when doing a run() with different a new pipeline reference given to the run_pipeline() method. Other places also had non-idempotent testing, and a new limiter interface was added to the BackgroundCachingJob.\r\n\r\nThe fixes are, unfortunately, interlinked with each other and a single PR must be made to fix all at once.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Concatenate small dataframe before shuffle.\r\n* Omit shuffling of empty partitions.\r\n    - This requires some adjustment to use the proxy object\r\n      if *all* partitions from all workers are

the xlangx calls out of universal.go and into graphx/translate.go caused a dependency loop (graphx -> xlangx -> graphx), so in order to break the cycle I moved all xlangx calls that were used in graphx directly into graphx, so now it looks like this: xlangx -> graphx.\r\n\r\nMost of those calls were in translate.go, so I just moved the contents of that file into graphx/xlang.go, which is a sensible place for it anyway since it's a lot of code modifying proto pipelines.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Bigtable table provider with simple read operation - filters and write will be done in another one in the near future.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\nBeamSQL doesn't support `ARRAY<ROW>`. If you use\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE test(\r\n  key VARCHAR,\r\n  family ROW<q1 ARRAY<ROW<val VARCHAR, timestampMicros BIGINT>>>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then\r\n\r\n`SELECT t.key, t.family.q1  FROM test t`\r\n\r\nCalcite shouts that it couldn't parse the generated code.\r\n\r\nWhat is possible is of little value:\r\n`SELECT t.key, t.family.q1[0] FROM test t`\r\n\r\nSo it's blocked to select all cells with timestamp and labels for now, but as I read about Bigtable it's usually not the desired case (the schema advice is to have single value per cell and usually only the latest value is needed).\r\n\r\nI used `val` instead of `value` because value is a keyword in SQL and hence would need to be used with backslashes.\r\n\r\nFor the Flat approach I followed the Spark's approach [1]\r\n\r\nFor the Row schema I combined Flink's approach [2] (with only latest values) and Bigquery's approach [3] (with possibility of using ROW)\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39530938/sparksql-on-hbase-tables\r\n[2] https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/table/connectors/hbase.html\r\n[3] https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#bigtableoptions\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
