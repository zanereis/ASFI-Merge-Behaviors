small enhancement to wskadmin to revoke a key. This already exists in wskadmin-next (#4005) but recently has an experience where running the new tool was too slow and took several seconds (it was not a very powerful CPU) and running the python version was faster. I could add a test for this reusing what's there for wskadmin-next.\r\n\r\n@chetanmeh thoughts?\r\n\r\n(I also added a \"generate only\" feature to get a new uuid:key without actually storing them, was handy for testing without affecting the database.

a number of playbooks for setting up a distributed deployment, including provisioning and setup of VMs (with openstack). The instructions and playbooks have not been touched - for the most part - since their introduction, are untested, and have various bits of rot.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that we remove them with this PR (as also shared on the dev list). For a distributed deployment with ansible, modifying the local environment's host file should suffice. Further, for swarm or kubernetes the deployment is entirely different also.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that we remove these files since there's clearly no effort to keep them up to date.

this PR, operators will be able to disable storing of activations into activations store.\nThe flag is implemented like the per-namespace-limits. It can be set with wskadmin.\n\nThis PR was the initial idea of #4078. In the meantime, the idea in the other PR changed, to implement a throttle instead of a switch. But as this is a completely new type of rate-limit (which does not only allow or deny requests) that's a bit bigger to implement. So I'll go with a staged approach here and implement it as switch first.\nIf someone needs a throttle instead of completely switching off the writes to the DB, this can be brought up again and the throttle can be built up on the solution we already have.\n\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\n\n## Related issue and scope\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\n\n## My changes affect the following components\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\n- [ ] API\n- [x] Controller\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\n- [x] Invoker\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\n- [ ] Tests\n- [ ] Deployment\n- [ ] CLI\n- [x] General tooling\n- [ ] Documentation\n\n## Types of changes\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

specifying [Time to live][1] at collection (or container level). \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor collection like `Activations` its desirable to expire the activations after some time. For CouchDB this is done by running a [cleaner script][2]. For CosmosDB we can make use of the [TTL][1] support which allows auto removal of entries after the TTL time has passed after their last modified time.\r\n\r\nSo to specify TTL for activations\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n    cosmosdb {\r\n        collections {\r\n            WhiskActivation {\r\n                time-to-live = 30 days\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also now sets the default TTL to -1 which allow us to later specify TTL at individual item level if required.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nThis is an improvement of [PR 3886](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3886) inspired by this [suggestion \r\n](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/4161) by @rabbah.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to segregate the logic common to load balancers into a CommonLoadBalancer abstract class. The ShardingContainerPoolBalancer and LeanBalancer (added in this PR) inherit from this class.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is to have a lean distro of OpenWhisk suitable to small form factors at the edge. The idea is to have Controller and Invoker compiled together into a \"lean\" controller-invoker (have a Gradle project for that) with controller calling the invoker's method directly via an in-memory object (a queue, which is also loaded via SPI) via a new pluggable load balancer that is selected via SPI using configuration file property setting. For more information here is a [blog](https://medium.com/@davidbr_9022/lean-openwhisk-open-source-faas-for-edge-computing-fb823c6bbb9b)\r\nAs well, briefly discussed it in this [thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/516efc0ed9afb09fe52e30d10eb9fe5091af91df53a46c07e1701122@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n\r\nThe goal is to avoid changes in the core components as much as possible. Rather this PR adds a few components. The main additions are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CommonLoadBalancer: provides common LoadBalancer fuctionality\r\n\r\n- LeanBalancer SPI: provides LoadBalancer to communicate with Invoker directly without Kafka in the middle (Invoker does not exist as a separate entity, it is built together with Controller)\r\n\r\n- LeanMessagingProvider SPI: provides Producer/Consumer implementers to communicate via in-memory queue instead of Kafka.\r\n\r\n- Ansible deployment: added controller-lean.yml and other files required for the Ansible deployment. Since lean controller is a combination of the controller + invoker projects, its ansible deploy.yml requires most of the values from both. Currently this problem is resolved by partially replicating variables from the regular invoker's deploy.yml to the tasks/invoker-lean.yml. Probably it would be better to avoid this duplication by having everything we need for lean in the regular deploy.yml.\r\n\r\n- Dockerfile: to build Lean controller docker image, which is a merge of the regular invoker + controller \r\n\r\n- Vagrantfile: a small change to make Lean available using environment variable\r\n\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\nIf the user invokes an action in a package binding, they can't know a package binding path from which action is invoked. because the current activation structure only records the resolved action path.\r\n\r\nfor example, suppose we have the following entities:\r\n\r\n- `package` : **pkg1**\r\n   - `action` : pkg1/**action1**\r\n- `package` **pkg2** bind **pkg1**\r\n- `package` **pkg3** bind **pkg1**\r\n\r\nIf user invokes the `pkg2/action1` action and the `pkg3/action1` action, all path annotations of invoked action in binding packages are saved as **namespace/pkg1/action1**.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"annotations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"key\": \"path\",\r\n            \"value\": \"namespace/pkg1/action1\"\r\n        },\r\n     ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nSo i added an annotation to distinguish between resolved action path and invoked action path and opend this PR.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"activationId\": \"f4250bb2721d4e4ca50bb2721d2e4cdd\",\r\n    \"annotations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"key\": \"path\",\r\n            \"value\": \"namespace/pkg1/action1\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"key\": \"originPath\",\r\n            \"value\": \"namespace/pkg2/action1\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThe legacy Travis build for OpenWhisk uses a depricated Travis engine and Docker 12.  While I know there are conversations around Docker 12 vs a later version, the use of the old Docker prevents use of certain good build features, namely Build Args for image selection and multi-stage builds.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes these changes:\r\n\r\n- Bumps the Travis build to Xenial Ubuntu (the latest supported), which includes Docker 18.\r\n- Patches Docker 18 service to listen on Port 4243 (TODO: let's get to shared sockets for everything)\r\n- Adds parameterization for limits.invocations.per.minute to reduce spurious system test failures - separate PR pending\r\n- Upgrades ephemeral CouchDB to `apache/couchdb:2.3` (to avoid a shared-storage bug) - see also PR #4202 \r\n- Changes how Ansible detects ansible uptime to use the ansible-cli in the ansible Docker image, rather than make assumptions about the ansible network protocol - PR #4205\r\n- Fix a redundant re-run of unit tests - separate PR pending\r\n\r\nI will track other PRs and rebase if they're committed.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [X] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [X] Tests\r\n- [X] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

exception.\r\n--\r\n \r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task ':tests:testCoverageLean'.\r\n> Process 'Gradle Test Executor 1' finished with non-zero exit value 137\r\nThis problem might be caused by incorrect test process configuration.\r\nPlease refer to the test execution section in the user guide at https://docs.gradle.org/4.10.2/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:test_execution\r\n \r\n* Try:\r\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.\r\n```\r\nSee https://scans.gradle.com/s/gpsagdjubkvmc/console-log for one such case\r\n\r\nI suspect this may be due Akka causing system exit for fatal error. However logs do not have any details from Akka around why this happened. May be by disabling this the error gets captured by Gradle and logged which would help in understanding the root cause\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

same CosmosDB client is used for all collections. This PR enables configuring separate client having different config on per collection basis.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nDepending on requirements it may be required to configure `AsyncDocumentClient` on per collection basis. For e.g. to use different config for each collection use following config\r\n\r\n```\r\ncosmosdb {\r\n  endpoint          =  \"https://<account>.documents.azure.com:443/\"\r\n  key               =  \"secret\"             # Access key\r\n  db                =  \"openwhisk\"            # Database name\r\n  throughput        = 1000          # Throughput configured for each collection within this db\r\n  consistency-level = \"Session\"\r\n  connection-policy {\r\n    max-pool-size = 1000\r\n    # When the value of this property is true, the SDK will direct write operations to\r\n    # available writable locations of geo-replicated database account\r\n    using-multiple-write-locations = false\r\n\r\n    # Sets the preferred locations for geo-replicated database accounts e.g. \"East US\"\r\n    # See names at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/locations/\r\n    preferred-locations = []\r\n    retry-options {\r\n      # Sets the maximum number of retries in the case where the request fails\r\n      # because the service has applied rate limiting on the client.\r\n      max-retry-attempts-on-throttled-requests = 9\r\n\r\n      # Sets the maximum retry time\r\n      # If the cumulative wait time exceeds this SDK will stop retrying and return the\r\n      # error to the application.\r\n      max-retry-wait-time                      = 30 s\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  # Specify entity specific overrides below. By default all config values would be picked from top level. To override\r\n  # any config option for specific entity specify them below. For example if multiple region writes need to be enabled\r\n  # for activations then\r\n   collections {\r\n        WhiskActivation {            # Add entity specific overrides here\r\n            connection-policy {\r\n                   using-multiple-write-locations = true\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove example configures all supported properties. OpenWHisk configures the same defaults so if you need to only change some of the config then you can do it like below\r\n\r\n```\r\ncosmosdb {\r\n  endpoint          =  \"https://<account>.documents.azure.com:443/\"\r\n  key               =  \"secret\"             # Access key\r\n  db                =  \"openwhisk\"            # Database name\r\n  # Specify entity specific overrides below. By default all config values would be picked from top level. To override\r\n  # any config option for specific entity specify them below. For example if multiple writes need to be enabled\r\n  # for activations then\r\n   collections {\r\n        WhiskActivation {            # Add entity specific overrides here\r\n            connection-policy {\r\n              using-multiple-write-locations = true\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

to OpenWhisk to support Multi-Architecture builds:\r\n\r\n1.  Support of 'docker --build-args FOO=BAR' in gradle/docker.gradle\r\n    has been broken for who knows how long, but with modern docker\r\n    now support ARG before the FROM line, it's necessary that it work\r\n    for build customizition and configuration.\r\n2.  The AdoptOpenJDK project is working on multi-architecture alpine\r\n    builds, but they're not yet available on Docker Hub, so use that\r\n    ARG line to get them from the S390X builds.  Also bump the JDK\r\n    version (I could live with making that an argument).\r\n3.  Add some stuff to the 'tools/ow-util/Dockerfile' to support\r\n    architecture-aware downloads rather than naively downloading\r\n    everything for x86_64.\r\n\r\nI _think_ because of what I see in other programs, that OpenWhisk\r\nis now using a more modern Docker to build images, but I'll let\r\nTravis be the judge of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [X] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nIn testing concurrent actions (multiple activations in same container) we noticed that when a container is used after `Container.suspend()`, the http connection may be re-created multiple times (and may have side affects of losing connections each time a new one is created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThis PR addresses this by:\r\n- using a separate function for creating the connection - this will be invoked first during /init\r\n- same function will be invoked again during `Container.resume()` (which means that subclasses must invoke `super.resume()`)\r\n\r\nThis way the subsequent + multiple calls to /run will arrive after connection has already been recreated.\r\nI extended the ContainerProxyTests to assert connection state (exists or not) after `suspend()` and after `resume()`.\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and

notices with concurrent action invocation scenario that same attachment is being fetched multiple times in case of cache miss. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIf multiple request try to load an action with attachment which is not present in cache then currently it leads to multiple request to load the same attachment from backing store. This PR adds a new test which demonstrate this behavior. This test would try to concurrently read action (5 threads). Without fix you would see logs like below which show that attachment is being read multiple times\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb logs [2018-12-17T08:50:49.800Z] [DEBUG] [#tid_7] [LocalEntitlementProvider] checking

Description\r\nThe authentication SPI can be used to provides multiple parallel ways to authenticate against Open Whisk by combining different authentication directives (e.g Basic and Bearer authentication).\r\nThe unmatched authentication directives (only one directives will match for agiven request) \r\nare adding additional authentication rejections to the overall list of rejection collected for a given request.\r\nDepending on the evaluation sequence of the additional validation rejections will overshadow meaningful validation rejections following the matched case.\r\nThis patch gives those validation rejections priority over the authentication rejections. \r\nIn this way a meaningful error messages are returned to the user. \r\nAn equivalent mechanism is already implemented for content type related rejections.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following

reverts commit d4a190c62f0aa1cd0bbecc62ad6b9885c70e9f6b.\r\nThe reason I'm reverting the commit is because while I can do a local path to mirror some of the changes in the main (fat?) loadbalancer, there is already a fair bit of divergence in the two load balancers because the lean version clones and owns the code and so it's prone to such slippage.\r\n\r\nThere is a cleaner organization which allows a common LB class which implements much of the logic that is shared between the two implementations. I started to do this on this branch https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/compare/master...rabbah:patch?expand=1 but it's clear it will take me a bit more time and we shouldn't break all the repos in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI further suggest in the refactoring that the lean LB actually implements identity actors for the invoker pool health and feeds so that there's less reason to diverge or special case some of the code. It's best to have one version of this code because it's functionally critical.\r\n\r\n@kpavel Sorry that I didn't get to review the code again more recently before it was merged, but I'm happy to help re-introduce this contribution with an improved organization as suggested here if you're agreeable.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-07T01:13:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T02:27:56Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T01:53:05Z","merged_at":"2018-12-07T01:53:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1ca290656ab2750c31e7a8b159d6124dddf531a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/bf0435dbcdb1a22bf4e4f7e7d22c4e00c72d2ce4","head":{"label":"rabbah:lean","ref":"lean","sha":"bf0435dbcdb1a22bf4e4f7e7d22c4e00c72d2ce4","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52371720,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjM3MTcyMA==","name":"openwhisk","full_name":"rabbah/openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah/openwhisk","description":"OpenWhisk

limits related to list operation against entities configurable. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the queries related to collections (used while doing list operation) make use of hard coded limits. \r\n\r\n### Impact due to wsk activation poll\r\n\r\nFor example if `limit=0` in list operation then it uses 200 has the default value. This is used in `wsk activation poll` which by default generates a GET request like\r\n\r\n```\r\n/api/v1/namespaces/_/activations?docs=true&limit=0&since=1542422386538&skip=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the poll command once started \"probably\" sticks to start time and we have seen user leaving such poll running for days (often left in one of the numerous tabs!) which causes the system to pull similar 200 records over and over.\r\n\r\n### CosmosDB and higher resource usage\r\n\r\nFurther in our case (using CosmosDB) which does client side merging of query results a sorted query gets executed like below\r\n\r\n1. Initial ask to fetch 200 records\r\n2. SDK makes call to each partition to fetch query record with limit\r\n    - If limit > default maxItemPerPageCount use maxItemPerPageCount i.e. 100\r\n    - If limit < then use the limit\r\n3. Perform a merge sort on client side\r\n\r\nIn such a case at times we have seen for listing 200 records SDK fetch ~ 900 records causing higher resource usage on db side\r\n\r\nTo reduce impact for such cases I would like to have these limits configurable\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

attempt to improve stability of _Action limits should be aborted when exceeding its memory limits_ test\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAs seen in #3246 the memory limit test fails intermittently with high rate. For now there is no deterministic way to reproduce the test failure. I think. it mostly happens when system is low on memory then directly allocating a big buffer fails before it can lead to OOM.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to improve that by consuming memory by gradually increasing an array. So far in few runs done this test at least does not seem to fail\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3246 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nExisting CLI test cases implicitly target the namespace via the `--auth` flag.  In some test scenarios, it's desirable to run the tests using the configured namespace without having the `--auth` override.  This change enables the existing CLI test cases to be run against the configured namespace.  The existing tests are left as-is.  To take advantage of this feature\r\n- create a wrapper trait (\"NewRunCliCmd\") that extends an existing `RunCliCmd` trait.  Inside this new trait, override the `prohibitAuthOverride` property value with a value of `true`\r\n- create a wrapper wsk cli class (\"NewWsk\") that extends the `Wsk` class.  This new class will also extend your \"NewRunCliCmd\" class\r\n- create a wrapper test class that extends an existing test class.  Inside this new class, override the `wsk` property with an instance of your \"NewWsk\" class.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis PR updates `gradlew :tools:dev:intellij`  to work with **docker-compose** and **ansible** locally . It basically makes the generation of IntelliJ configuration a bit more generic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it adds a container factory for Mac, to expose action container ports on the host, as otherwise the invoker can't make HTTP requests to the action containers. Docker for Mac doesn't expose any direct route to containers.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThe `execute` method in `ApacheBlockingContainerClient` allows the invoker to retry communication attempts to a user container. This retry logic proves to be problematic when a user container exits before the invoker is able to connect to it. Such an event may happen if a user container exits very quickly. In this case the invoker retries an exorbitant amount of times needless as the container has already exited, resulting in the waste of resources in the invoker. \r\n\r\nFor retries, these changes take in to consideration the amount of time taken during the connection attempts from the invoker to a user container. There is also a cap introduced on the number of retries allowed. As a result, retries will be performed a maximum of three times or less if the action timeout is exceeded when taking into consideration the amount of time each connection attempt takes.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

By implementing a YARNContainerFactory, OpenWhisk can run actions on Hadoop clusters. This will lower the barrier to adoption and expand the potential use cases for OpenWhisk.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe YARNContainerFactory uses the Apache Hadoop Services REST API to create a single YARN service with a component for each action type. Both simple authentication and Kerberos/SPNEGO are supported. This was tested with Apache Hadoop 3.1.1.\r\nhttps://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/yarn-service/YarnServiceAPI.html\r\nThe implemention is based on the MesosContainerFactory.\r\n\r\nThis was first implemented using Akka HTTP, but was rewritten to use the Apache HTTP client in order to suport SPNEGO.\r\n\r\nThere is a MockYARNRM in the tests directory.

See http://netty.io/wiki/reference-counted-objects.html for more information.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther in some cases Controller process got killed with `OutOfDirectMemoryError`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-11-16T11:08:34.576Z] [WARN] An exception was thrown by io.reactivex.netty.pipeline.ssl.SslCompletionHandler$1.operationComplete()\r\nio.netty.util.internal.OutOfDirectMemoryError: failed to allocate 16777216 byte(s) of direct memory (used: 7147094023, max: 7158628352)\r\n    at io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent.incrementMemoryCounter(PlatformDependent.java:640)\r\n    at io.netty.util.internal.PlatformDependent.allocateDirectNoCleaner(PlatformDependent.java:594)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena$DirectArena.allocateDirect(PoolArena.java:764)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena$DirectArena.newChunk(PoolArena.java:740)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocateNormal(PoolArena.java:244)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocate(PoolArena.java:226)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocate(PoolArena.java:146)\r\n    at io.netty.buffer.PooledByteBufAllocator.newDirectBuffer(PooledByteBufAllocator.java:324)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer [Netty Leak Detection][1] documentation this warning would be emitted if its resource leak detection logic (which works by sampling 1% allocations) detects a leak. \r\n\r\n### Root cause and Fix\r\n\r\nTo determine the leak source one can set `-Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=PARANOID` and run the setup/test. After setting this property the test still passed fine and no warning was seen. Then we reduced the memory to `-Xmx32m` and re ran `CosmosDBArtifactStoreTests` and the warning showed up in 1 of 10 runs.\r\n\r\nDigging further issue was determined to be present in the way we current apply limit\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/f35e23ae19b87bf6c3d27f579ca42a4da8ebb2b0/common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/database/cosmosdb/CosmosDBArtifactStore.scala#L221-L239\r\n\r\nHere we use the `take` operator to ensure that stream does not consume more than `limit` items. If there are more item then source is cancelled. Its so happening if we set limit=1 (which is the case for Identity/auth related queries) then this prevents proper cleanup of underlying source. \r\n\r\nAs a fix we now consume whole stream and then apply limit on the resulting list. This should be safe \r\n\r\n1. For query related to `actovations` and `whisks` limit is made part of query also via `TOP X` clause. So underlying db does not return more than limit item\r\n2. For query related to subject we cannot pass `TOP` as we need to perform join which may result in more entries in output. But here the result set would not be more than 1 in most cases\r\n\r\n### Test Setup\r\n\r\nTo recreate the issuse a new test `CosmosDBLeakTests` is added which repeatedly performs the auth query multiple times. This test fails much often when running within IDE (with `-Xmx20m`) however I was not able to make it fail when running via command line. Post fix test consistently passes in IDE also. In case of failure it dumps the stack trace where the leaked resource was accessed\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-11-19T12:48:34.810Z] [ERROR] LEAK: ByteBuf.release() was not called before it's garbage-collected.

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWe ran across an issue where a package binding can contain a reference to itself. When this happens, any attempt at reading the package results in an infinite loop, eventually leading to the controller falling over. This can occur by simply performing the following commands using the `wsk` tool.\r\n```bash\r\n$ wsk package create target\r\n$ wsk package bind target binding\r\n$ wsk package bind binding binding\r\n```\r\nThere are two changes contained in this PR\r\n1. Prevent allowing an incoming binding update to point to itself as a reference, which previously created an invalid data record.\r\n2. Prevent following a package's binding reference when it points to itself which causes the infinite loop.\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [X] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
