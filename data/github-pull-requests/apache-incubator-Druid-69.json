Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add support of the new interfaces (`InputSource` and `InputFormat`) introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8823 for sampler. The key changes are:\r\n\r\n- Renamed `FirehoseSampler` -> `InputSourceSampler`.\r\n- `IndexTaskSamplerSpec` now supports both old (`parser` and `firehose`) and new (`inputFormat` and `inputSource`) APIs. You cannot mix them though.\r\n- `SeekableStreamSamplerSpec` now supports both `parser` and `inputFormat`. \r\n- To give the same experience with both sampler and Kafka/Kinesis indexing service, KIS now supports both `parser` and `inputFormat`. The supervisor will always internally fill `parser` if it was set in the supervisor spec to create sub tasks. Since the sub task understands both new and old APIs, it should work during the rolling update.\r\n- `SamplerCache` is removed now. This is because it caches the raw byte array of each row which makes sense for row-oriented file formats.\r\n- `SamplerResponse` now contains a `Map` of raw data instead of `byte[]`. This map will be serialized into JSON and sent to the caller like UI.\r\n- The behavior of `SeekableStreamSamplerFirehose` has changed. It returned an `InputRow` of null if it couldn't fetch any data within `POLL_TIMEOUT_MS`. Now it waits until it fetches any data.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n  - [x] Been tested during rolling update by running 1) old overlord + new middleManager and 2) new overlord + old middleManager.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

goal of this patch is to improve the clarity and usefulness of\r\nDruid's logging for cluster operators. For more information, see\r\nhttps://twitter.com/cowtowncoder/status/1195469299814555648.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this patch does the following:\r\n\r\n- Changes a lot of INFO logs to DEBUG, and DEBUG to TRACE, with the\r\n  goal of reducing redundancy and improving clarity by avoiding\r\n  showing rarely-useful log messages. This includes most \"starting\"\r\n  and \"stopping\" messages, and most messages related to individual\r\n  columns.\r\n- Adds new log4j2 templates that show operators how to enabled DEBUG\r\n  logging for certain important packages. These templates can be found in\r\n  the `_common` configuration folder in the example clusters under `conf/druid`.\r\n- Eliminate stack traces for query errors, unless log level is DEBUG\r\n  or more. This is useful because query errors often indicate user\r\n  error rather than system error, but dumping stack trace often gave\r\n  operators the impression that there was a system failure.\r\n- Adds task id to Appenderator, AppenderatorDriver thread names. In\r\n  the default log4j2 configuration, this will put them in log lines\r\n  as well. It's very useful if a user is using the Indexer, where\r\n  multiple tasks run in the same JVM.\r\n- More consistent terminology when it comes to \"sequences\" (sets of\r\n  segments that are handed-off together by Kafka ingestion) and\r\n  \"offsets\" (cursors in partitions). These terms had been confused in\r\n  some log messages due to the fact that Kinesis calls offsets\r\n  \"sequence numbers\".\r\n- Replaces some ugly toString calls with either the JSONification or\r\n  something more operator-accessible (like a URL or segment identifier,\r\n  instead of JSON object representing the same).","created_at":"2019-11-17T17:54:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T23:49:18Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T21:57:59Z","merged_at":"2019-11-19T21:57:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"c44452f0c1b051b03343d8bb479828f01461d68f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":145651458,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDU2NTE0NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Ease%20of%20Use","name":"Ease

Description\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up to #8823, this PR adds Parquet support to Druid native batch indexing, largely re-using existing code from the current Hadoop extension. All of the unit tests have been adapted to also run with the new `DruidParquetReader`.\r\n\r\nParquet can be used in native batch indexing with any `InputSource`, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"index_parallel\",\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"local\",\r\n        \"baseDir\": \"/some/path/to/wikipedia/file/\",\r\n        \"filter\": \"wiki.parquet\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"inputFormat\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"parquet\"\r\n        \"flattenSpec\": {\r\n            \"useFieldDiscovery\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"binaryAsString\": false\r\n      },\r\n      \"appendToExisting\": false\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or

Description\r\nThis terrible PR modifies `NullHandling` to no longer have a default value since it appears in practice to overwrite the instance injected by `NullHandlingModule` through `requestStaticInjection`, causing the `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` config to not function when it is in a `runtime.properties` or similar file, and only works when specified as an argument. The injected instance was in fact being created, it was just being overwritten immediately by the default value that was being set for it in `NullHandling`.\r\n\r\nSince there is no longer a  default value, I have added a method that is just awful, `NullHandling.initializeForTests()`, which any tests or benchmarks or anything that does not wire up injection **_must_** use to avoid null pointer exceptions. This is bad, but seemed better than any alternative I could come up with, because `NullHandling.replaceWithDefault` is called in a lot of 'hot' places, so introducing an `if` statement or method call overhead from using a `Supplier` or something like that didn't seem worth risking the overhead for the sake of easier to write tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n-

PR fixes two issues specific to Kinesis resharding:\r\n- When shards expired after the retention period, old tasks created under the previous shard set (with potentially different task group -> shard mappings) could incorrectly add shards to task groups when the supervisor checkpoints those tasks\r\n- When a task is assigned only closed shards and doesn't read any data from them (either the closed shard had no additional records but this condition hasn't been detected yet, or all additional records in the shard are unparseable/thrown away), the task wouldn't publish anything and thus the supervisor would not be informed that those shards have been closed and fully read. The supervisor would then repeatedly to assign these shards to tasks which continue to read and publish nothing.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue with the base SeekableStreamSupervisor protocol:\r\n- When a task is stopped by a supervisor, it's possible that it hasn't started publishing and hasn't set its endOffsets yet; if the supervisor retrieves the endOffsets from the task at this point, it can get the end of partition marker in the response. If the supervisor uses that end of partition marker as the subsequent starting offset for later tasks, ingestion for that partition will get stuck. \r\n\r\nThe first issue is fixed by:\r\n- The map that used to track task group -> shard and shard -> offset mappings has been split into two maps, so that updating the shard offsets for checkpointing will not affect the task group -> shard mappings.\r\n- The Kinesis supervisor has been adjusted so that the `partitionIds` list can only change in `updatePartitionDataFromStream()`\r\n- When a shard is detected as closed in `updatePartitionDataFromStream()`, it will be immediately removed from the `partitionIds` list and no longer assigned to future tasks\r\n- In `discoverTasks()`, the Kinesis supervisor will immediately terminate any currently running tasks that have shards known to be closed or expired.\r\n- The general idea behind the changes above is to remove the unnecessary link between group -> shard and shard -> offset mappings and then allow shard removals to be handled similarly to taskCount partition reassignments\r\n\r\nThe second issue is fixed by:\r\n- The publishing step for seekablestream tasks will still update the current offsets in metadata if no segments were created but some data was read from the stream\r\n\r\nThe third issue is fixed by:\r\n- If the supervisor sees the end of partition marker in a getEndOffsets call, it will not change the offset for that partition in its internal state, but will refetch the current offsets for those partitions on the next task assignment. Longer term, we should reevaluate the protocol to see how to prevent this from happening, but this fix prevents the issue from stopping ingestion for such partitions for now.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nRefactoring to make it easier to later add range partitioning for perfect rollup parallel indexing. This is accomplished by adding several new base classes (e.g., `PerfectRollupWorkerTask`) and new classes for encapsulating logic that needs to be changed for different partitioning\r\nstrategies (e.g., `IndexTaskInputRowIteratorBuilder`).\r\n\r\nThe code is functionally equivalent to before except for the following small behavior changes:\r\n\r\n1. `PartialSegmentMergeTask`: Previously, this task had a priority of `DEFAULT_TASK_PRIORITY`. It now has a priority of `DEFAULT_BATCH_INDEX_TASK_PRIORITY` (via the new `PerfectRollupWorkerTask` base class), since it is a batch index task.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

#8150\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces and removes the legacy coordinator and overlord consoles and replaces them with the new console. The new console has been adapted to have smart capability detection with graceful fallback mode when running on services where not all the APIs are available.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/68368170-464db100-00ec-11ea-9ff7-c212b8e20770.png)\r\n\r\nReasons for doing this:\r\n- To provide a much better experience to new users with fewer components to understand. This is especially true with `coordiantor.asOverlord` mode being the new config default.\r\n- The old consoles are not maintained and have a lot of \"code rot\" (the Coordiantor console has 10s of errors thrown in the JS console and the Overlord console uses a five year old version of jQuery with 23 LGTM alerts)\r\n- The old consoles do not look good and are not visually consistent with each other.\r\n- Fewer dependancies. The old consoles depend on some really old libraries. \r\n\r\nI believe that the new console has full functional parity with what it is replacing but if I missed anything speak up and it will be addressed ASAP.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T07:39:07Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T05:35:33Z","closed_at":"2019-11-16T03:45:15Z","merged_at":"2019-11-16T03:45:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"17d773dca2e10529912d0e645170fe0eb5a13d35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

is a class of bugs due to the fact that BaseObjectColumnValueSelector\r\nhas both \"getObject\" and \"isNull\" methods, but in most selector implementations\r\nand most call sites, it is clear that the intent of \"isNull\" is only to apply\r\nto the primitive getters, not the object getter. This makes sense, because the\r\npurpose of isNull is to enable detection of nulls in otherwise-primitive columns.\r\nImagine a string column with a numeric selector built on top of it. You would\r\nwant it to return isNull = true, so numeric aggregators don't treat it as\r\nall zeroes.\r\n\r\nSometimes this design leads people to accidentally guard non-primitive get\r\nmethods with \"selector.isNull\" checks, which is improper.\r\n\r\nThis patch has three goals:\r\n\r\n1) Fix null-handling bugs that already exist in this class.\r\n2) Make interface and doc changes that reduce the probability of future bugs.\r\n3) Fix other, unrelated bugs I noticed in the stringFirst and stringLast\r\n   aggregators while fixing null-handling bugs. I thought about splitting this\r\n   into its own patch, but it ended up being tough to split from the\r\n   null-handling fixes.\r\n\r\nFor (1) the fixes are,\r\n\r\n- Fix StringFirst and StringLastAggregatorFactory to stop guarding getObject\r\n  calls on isNull, by no longer extending NullableAggregatorFactory. Now uses\r\n  -1 as a sigil value for null, to differentiate nulls and empty strings.\r\n- Fix ExpressionFilter to stop guarding getObject calls on isNull. Also, use\r\n  eval.asBoolean() to avoid calling getLong on the selector after already\r\n  calling getObject.\r\n- Fix ObjectBloomFilterAggregator to stop guarding DimensionSelector calls\r\n  on isNull. Also, refactored slightly to avoid the overhead of calling\r\n  getObject followed by another getter (see BloomFilterAggregatorFactory for\r\n  part of this).\r\n\r\nFor (2) the main changes are,\r\n\r\n- Remove the \"isNull\" method from BaseObjectColumnValueSelector.\r\n- Clarify \"isNull\" doc on BaseNullableColumnValueSelector.\r\n- Rename NullableAggregatorFactory -> NullbleNumericAggregatorFactory to emphasize\r\n  that it only works on aggregators that take numbers as input.\r\n- Similar naming changes to the Aggregator, BufferAggregator, and AggregateCombiner.\r\n- Similar naming changes to helper methods for groupBy, ValueMatchers, etc.\r\n\r\nFor (3) the other fixes for StringFirst and StringLastAggregatorFactory are,\r\n\r\n- Fixed buffer overrun in the buffer aggregators when some characters in the string\r\n  code into more than one byte (the old code used \"substring\" to apply a byte limit,\r\n  which is bad). I did this by introducing a new StringUtils.toUtf8WithLimit method.\r\n- Fixed weird IncrementalIndex logic that led to reading nulls for the timestamp.\r\n- Adjusted weird StringFirst/Last logic that worked around the weird IncrementalIndex\r\n  behavior.\r\n- Refactored to share code between the four aggregators.\r\n- Improved test coverage.\r\n- Made the base stringFirst, stringLast aggregators adaptive, and streamlined the\r\n  xFold versions into aliases. The adaptiveness is similar to how other aggregators\r\n  like hyperUnique

Description\r\n\r\nThis is the First PR for https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8812 which includes the new interfaces proposed in #8812. A couple of implementations are also included such as `LocalInputSource` and `HttpInputSource` for `InputSource`, and `CsvInputFormat` and `JsonInputFormat` for `InputFormat`. Their formats are:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"inputSource\": {\r\n  \"type\" : \"local\",\r\n  \"baseDir\" : \"/path/to/dir\",\r\n  \"filter\" : \"your filter\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"inputSource\": {\r\n  \"type\" : \"http\",\r\n  \"uris\" : [\"http://example.com/uri1\", \"http://example.com/uri2\"],\r\n  \"httpAuthenticationUsername\": \"username\",\r\n  \"httpAuthenticationPassword\": \"password provider\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"inputFormat\": {\r\n  \"type\": \"csv\",\r\n  \"columns\": [ \"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\" ],\r\n  \"listDelimiter\": \"|\",\r\n  \"findColumnsFromHeader\" : true,\r\n  \"skipHeaderRows\" : 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"inputFormat\": {\r\n  \"type\": \"json\",\r\n  \"flattenSpec\": {\r\n    // your flatten spec\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that both `inputSource` and `inputFormat` are in `ioConfig` as below:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"ioConfig\": {\r\n  \"type\" : \"index\" or \"index_parallel\",\r\n  \"inputSource\" : {\r\n    // your input source\r\n  },\r\n  \"inputFormat\": {\r\n    // your input format\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are supported only by native batch indexing tasks yet. Sampler doesn't support them yet.\r\n\r\nThe old `firehose` and `parser` parameters should still work, but you cannot mix them. Only the combinations of `firehose` + `parser` or `inputSource`  + `inputFormat` are allowed.\r\n\r\nDocuments will be added after more inputSources and inputFormats are implemented in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\r\n---\r\nThis change is [<img

Description\r\n\r\nI would like to add documentation for Druid SQL compatible null handling added in #4349 to the website, in part because it has been merged for quite a while now, but also so that we can feel better about the changes #8566 causes in SQL behavior in Druids native mode (tl;dr some calcite optimizations lead to some query incompatibilities specifically around our treatment of `''` and `null` as equivalent).\r\n\r\nPart of like.. being responsible and stuff, before adding this documentation I first wanted to collect some data to determine if it _was a good idea to in fact document it at this time_. The place I was specifically worried about was the `isNull` check, so I added a benchmark, `NullHandlingBitmapGetVsIteratorBenchmark`,  and ran some experiments to see what to expect as well as if we could do better.\r\n\r\nThe nature of selectors lends itself to using a bitmap iterator as an alternative to calling bitmap.get for every `isNull` check, so I first tested `get` vs `iterator` on 500k row 'column's with various null bitmap densities and filter selectivities to simulate the overhead of having null value handling selector with each approach. I have so far only collected information on roaring, because with `concise` the `get` method take far too long to complete at low selectivity, \r\n```\r\n# Parameters: (bitmapType = concise, filterMatch = 0.99999, nullDensity = 0.5, numRows = 500000)\r\n\r\n# Run progress: 0.00% complete, ETA 00:22:30\r\n# Fork: 1 of 1\r\n# Warmup Iteration   1: 641486825.960 us/op\r\n...\r\n```\r\nmore on this later.\r\n\r\nTo help make sense of the numbers collected from this, I created heatmaps to compare the differences between the approaches. With the raw output, these looked something like this which isn't so telling:\r\n\r\n![raw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170194-b52bde00-ff23-11e9-9e84-2047cc67df72.gif)\r\n\r\nInterpolating the data to fill in the gaps yields something a bit prettier, but still not incredibly telling on it's own:\r\n![difference-iterator-get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170242-dbea1480-ff23-11e9-923e-67872816a1a3.gif)\r\nBut does start to offer that the iterator is better at dealing with a larger number of rows, diminishing as the density of the bitmap increases.\r\n\r\nScaling the data points to estimate the _cost per row_ in nanoseconds provides a much more useful picture, and shows the abysmal performance of using the iterator at super high selectivity (e.g. 0.1% of rows match and are selected) with really dense bitmaps:\r\n![difference-per-row-iterator-get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170352-426f3280-ff24-11e9-9782-7a47892f0f18.gif)\r\nHowever if we truncate the results and compare areas where the `iterator` is better:\r\n![difference-per-row-iterator-better](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170371-53b83f00-ff24-11e9-989e-41ec0219d29c.gif)\r\nto where `get` is better\r\n![difference-per-row-get-better](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170380-5b77e380-ff24-11e9-8f4f-538004046187.gif)\r\nit does look like the iterator does perform up to _15 ns per row_ better than using `get` when processing a lot of rows.\r\n\r\nSearching for a way around the limitation, I was unaware that the `IntIterator` for roaring was actually a `PeekableIntIterator` which is an iterator that offers an `advanceIfNeeded` method that allows skipping the iterator ahead to an index. `ConciseSet` actually has a similar method on it's iterator, `skipAllBefore`, which _is used by_ the `contains` method that the `get` of concise uses! This is likely why concise just flat out wouldn't complete the benchmarks when processing a higher number of rows, because every `get` is creating an iterator, skipping to the position, loop checking to see if the iterator contains the index or passes it, and then throwing it away.\r\n\r\nAdding the 'peekable' iterator to the benchmark had a similar outcome to using the plain iterator, \r\n\r\n![difference-peekable-iterator-get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170721-c8d84400-ff25-11e9-9c10-47d5ebf40933.gif)\r\n\r\nbut without nearly the overhead at high selectivity on dense bitmaps. \r\n![difference-per-row-peekable-iterator-get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170735-d392d900-ff25-11e9-8476-7bb2728fe43b.gif)\r\nIt's still worse, but not nearly as bad, no more than 60ns slower per row when processing a small number of rows than get, compared to over 2 microseconds for using the plain iterator.\r\n\r\nPeekable iterator better:\r\n\r\n![difference-per-row-peekable-iterator-better](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68170780-f91fe280-ff25-11e9-86b8-6ff026d4813e.gif)\r\n\r\nGet better than peekable

the per row cost in nanoseconds of checking for nulls at all, I threw together these animations:\r\n\r\nget:\r\n![get-per-row-breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68171443-a3006e80-ff28-11e9-87be-3894c0978e73.gif)\r\n\r\niterator:\r\n![iterator-per-row-breakdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/68171452-a85db900-ff28-11e9-817a-833b1f64f823.gif)\r\n\r\npeekable

the `isNull` check to use ` PeekableIntIterator` in order to optimize the case where the selector is going to be processing a larger number of rows. `PeekableIntIterator` was chosen over `IntIterator` because it offers nearly the same performance increase at low selectivity, without nearly as severe of a performance loss for high selectivity.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

PR is just a bunch of cleanup for the data loader flow. I went over it with a fine comb, making sure that every step is consistent and that the blurbs and the doc links are up to date.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n- Cleaned up the UX (and code structure) with a simple `specPreview` that is uniform between views and is waiting to get applied to the spec.\r\n- Cleaned up the sampler calling code (removed a bunch of hacky `setTimeout`s)\r\n- Added a `Learn more` button to every blurb\r\n- Fixed a bug in ArrayInput\r\n- Made sure that the selection behavior is consistent across views\r\n- Made the `Parse time` step less agro and scrary\r\n\r\nThe changes are visually minor but every step was improved in some way; here is an example of a view that got a lot of love\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/67654679-9c13a380-f90b-11e9-8681-d5f87e13b087.png)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-28T05:46:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T23:52:59Z","closed_at":"2019-10-28T15:08:47Z","merged_at":"2019-10-28T15:08:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec8ce74f1c2f39bdbc4a6b2b5a53434d94c437db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

PR fixes the issue caused by default case insensitive comparison of nonbinary string in MySQL metadata storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using MySQL as metadata storage, the default collation of specific character set for nonbinary string comparison is case insensitive.\r\n\r\nSo there are problems when executing update statement if there are dataSources with different cases, like _dataSource_aaa_ and _dataSource_AAA_.\r\nFor example, the update statement `UPDATE druid_segments SET used=false WHERE dataSource = 'dataSource_aaa'` will affect records of both _dataSource_aaa_ and _dataSource_AAA_.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix this issue by add a COLLATE attribute of dataSource column when creating tables.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#8733 (and likely #8613, but untested in this PR)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds array expression support to `transformSpec`, filling in one of the remaining functionality gaps left from #7525.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR removes `ParseSpec.verify` since its' only use afaict was preventing transform expr that did not replace their input from functioning, because the implementations would complain about dimensions that were not mapped to a column, discovered when I was trying to add a test for the newly added array expression support of `ExpressionTransform`.\r\n\r\nTagged with label release notes since in additional to fixing odd behavior with array expressions at indexing time, `ParseSpec.verify` was annotated `@PublicApi`, though since the only callers were the constructors of the `ParseSpec` that implemented the method, this shouldn't cause anything other than perhaps a complication issue for private extensions due to needing to remove `@Override` on the `verify` method.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.","created_at":"2019-10-25T08:29:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T23:52:02Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T19:04:38Z","merged_at":"2019-11-13T19:04:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc54b2a9dfc2b3ac10bc8097e077151def8389a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with highly partitioned/fragmented data, thetasketch module spent most of the time merging the sketches. It would also increase the size of the segments. We want to use the p sampling config of the sketch module to make it better. Setting the sampling to, say, p = 0.5, for all sketches, will automatically throw out 50% of all the data coming in to all the sketches. This would also potentially reduce the query time by sacrificing some accuracy.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nWe change the theta sketch module, just add another parameter of the constructor and use it to the merger.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the Select query type, in favor of the Scan query. Since the introduction of time ordered scan query with #7133, our documentation has already been recommending people use scan queries instead of select due to the heavy memory impact of the select query, and Druid SQL has not generated select queries at all since #7373. Functionally, scan is equivalent, less the paging functionality, however the more efficient nature of the scan query makes the paging functionality un-necessary.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I feel that removing the choice between 2 _very_ similar query types should be more user friendly, and for code hygiene and lower maintenance for the query processing layer on our end.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously incompatible with previous releases so will need to be called out prominently in the release notes should we merge this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added
