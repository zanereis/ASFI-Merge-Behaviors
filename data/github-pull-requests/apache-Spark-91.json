Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR basically reverts the SPARK-31631, which was aimed to address [HADOOP-12656](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12656)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince [HADOOP-12656](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12656) got fixed in Hadoop 2.8.0/3.0.0, and SPARK-42452 removed support for Hadoop2, we can remove this workaround now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveShim.ShimFileSinkDesc`, which is used to address serializable issue of `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.plan.FileSinkDesc`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n[HIVE-6171](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6171) changed `FileSinkDesc`'s property from `String dirName` to `Path dirName`, but the `Path` is not serializable until [HADOOP-13519](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13519) (got fixed in Hadoop 3.0.0).\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-42452 removed support for Hadoop2, we can remove this workaround now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new callback \"onQueryIdle\" to StreamingQueryListener, which was a part of query progress update.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the new callback method is below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef onQueryIdle(event: QueryIdleEvent): Unit\r\n\r\nclass QueryIdleEvent(val id: UUID, val runId: UUID) extends Event\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide a default implementation for onQueryIdle in StreamingQueryListener so that it does not break existing implementations of streaming query listener in Scala/Java. \r\n\r\nNote that it's a behavioral change as users will receive the different callback when the streaming query is being idle for configured period of time (previously they receive the callback onQueryProgress), but this is worth doing as described in the section \"Why are the changes needed?\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPeople has been having a lot of confusions about query progress event on idleness query; it’s not only the matter of understanding but also comes up with various types of complaints, because they tend to think the event only happens after the microbatch has finished. In addition, misunderstanding may also lead to data loss on monitoring - since we give the latest batch ID for update event on idleness, if the listener implementation blindly performs upsert the information to the external storage based on batch ID, they are in risk on losing data.\r\n\r\nThis also complicates the logic because we have to memorize the execution for the previous batch, which is arguably not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After this change, users won't get query progress update event from idle query. Instead, they will get query idle event.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UTs.","created_at":"2023-04-19T10:02:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T08:21:09Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T08:21:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84f75a25363392cef7fedb26dca9d4a24b20ae4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change allows applications to control whether their metadata gets saved in the db. For applications with higher security requirements, storing application secret in the db without any encryption is a potential security risk. While filesystem ACLs can help protect the access to the db, this level of security is not sufficient for some use cases. Such applications can chose to not save their metadata in the db. As a result, these applications may experience more failures in the event of a node restart, but we believe this trade-off is acceptable given the increased security risk.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese modifications are necessary to reduce the likelihood of security threats for applications with elevated security requirements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Added a configuration `spark.shuffle.server.recovery.disabled` which by default is `false`. When set to `true`, the metadata of the application will not saved in the db.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs and also verified with test applications in our test environment.","created_at":"2023-04-19T06:05:29Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T18:30:25Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T17:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abeeaf8567b6f8daebcbb9a4f791b5dd8be969ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4fa355d772bd812503f2d972533ca1a40c065d3","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-43179","ref":"SPARK-43179","sha":"c4fa355d772bd812503f2d972533ca1a40c065d3","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`write jdbc` will test failed when test `ClientE2ETestSuite` using Java 11 & 17 without `-Phive` because the test case need `derby` in the classpath

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR follows the https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/192#issuecomment-15238595 to correct the current implementation of the **two-stage parsing strategy** in `AbstractSqlParser`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should be a long-standing issue, before [SPARK-38385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38385), Spark uses `DefaultErrorStrategy`, and after [SPARK-38385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38385) Spark uses class `SparkParserErrorStrategy() extends DefaultErrorStrategy`. It is not a correct implementation of the \"two-stage parsing strategy\"\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/192#issuecomment-15238595\r\n\r\n> You can save a great deal of time on correct inputs by using a two-stage parsing strategy.\r\n>\r\n> 1. Attempt to parse the input using BailErrorStrategy and PredictionMode.SLL.\r\n>    If no exception is thrown, you know the answer is correct.\r\n> 2. If a ParseCancellationException is thrown, retry the parse using the default\r\n>    settings (DefaultErrorStrategy and PredictionMode.LL).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the Spark SQL parser becomes more powerful, SQL like `SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2` parse succeeded after this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT is added.","created_at":"2023-04-18T09:29:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T08:37:54Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T08:37:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6cc9c96f784e44a600bad924e7cf7c074c0271f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03bb334e437b4e4b0efcd7d7ca03787106d60a02","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-42552","ref":"SPARK-42552","sha":"03bb334e437b4e4b0efcd7d7ca03787106d60a02","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supports the `array_insert` and `array_prepend`. Users insert an element into the head of array is common operation. Considered, we want make array_prepend reuse the implementation of array_insert, but it seems a bit performance worse if the position is foldable and positive.\r\nThe reason is that always do the check for position is negative or positive, and the code is too long. Too long code will lead to JIT failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove ArrayInsert if the position is foldable and positive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust change the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-18T05:43:58Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T02:53:33Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T14:12:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"241c830322c3808dd58fa211013245f875c953dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40833/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40833/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40833/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29fa1231e7a97963b968148f5207171e42a2c907","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-43137_new","ref":"SPARK-43137_new","sha":"29fa1231e7a97963b968148f5207171e42a2c907","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark on YARN, when we launch a Spark application via `spark-submit --proxy-user jack ...`, the YARN will launch containers(usually Linux processes) using Unix user \"jack\", and some components/libraries rely on the login user in default, one example is Alluxio\r\nhttps://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/blob/da77d688bdbb0cf0c6477bed4d3187897fe2a2e1/core/common/src/main/java/alluxio/conf/PropertyKey.java#L6469-L6476\r\n```\r\n  public static final PropertyKey SECURITY_LOGIN_USERNAME =\r\n      stringBuilder(Name.SECURITY_LOGIN_USERNAME)\r\n          .setDescription(\"When alluxio.security.authentication.type is set to SIMPLE or \"\r\n              + \"CUSTOM, user application uses this property to indicate the user requesting \"\r\n              + \"Alluxio service. If it is not set explicitly, the OS login user will be used.\")\r\n          .setConsistencyCheckLevel(ConsistencyCheckLevel.ENFORCE)\r\n          .setScope(Scope.CLIENT)\r\n          .build();\r\n```\r\nTo reduce the difference between Spark on YARN and Spark on K8s, we hope Spark on K8s keeps the same ability to allow to dynamically change login user on submitting Spark application.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it allows the user to custom Pod Unix username by setting env var `SPARK_USER_NAME` in K8s, reducing the gap between Spark on YARN and K8s.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew IT is added.\r\n\r\nAlso manually testing in our internal K8s cluster.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit --master=k8s://xxxx \\\r\n        --conf spark.kubernetes.driverEnv.SPARK_USER_NAME=tom \\\r\n\t--conf spark.executorEnv.SPARK_USER_NAME=tom \\\r\n\t--proxy-user tom \\\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen login the Pod, verify the Unix username by `id -un` is `tom` instead of `185`","created_at":"2023-04-18T04:35:48Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T00:17:43Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T00:17:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02bcef5e0c9372790415bdd5aaf432357cbbdf99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ee42bb567f29cc8051144a9a0cac0fc84bcf721","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-43171","ref":"SPARK-43171","sha":"3ee42bb567f29cc8051144a9a0cac0fc84bcf721","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUses deduplicated field names when creating Arrow `RecordBatch`.\r\n\r\nThe result pandas DataFrame will contain `dict` with suffix `_0`, `_1`, etc. if there are duplicated field names.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a, 3 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                             y\r\n0  1  {'a_0': 1, 'a_1': 2, 'b': 3}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `df.toPandas()` with Arrow enabled fails when there are duplicated field names.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a, 3 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Ran out of field metadata, likely malformed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`df.toPandas()` with Arrow enabled fails when there are duplicated field names will work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to transfer a local relation to the server in streaming way when it exceeds some size which is defined by the SQL config `spark.sql.session.localRelationCacheThreshold`. The config value is 64MB by default. In particular:\r\n1. The client applies the `sha256` function over the arrow form of the local relation;\r\n2. It checks presents of the relation at the server side by sending the relation hash to the server;\r\n3. If the server doesn't have the local relation, the client transfers the local relation as an artefact with the name `cache/<sha256>`;\r\n4. As soon as the relation has presented at the server already, or transferred recently, the client transform the logical plan by replacing the `LocalRelation` node by `CachedLocalRelation` with the hash.\r\n5. On another hand, the server converts `CachedLocalRelation` back to `LocalRelation` by retrieving the relation body from the local cache.\r\n\r\n#### Details of the implementation\r\nThe client sends new command `ArtifactStatusesRequest` to check either the local relation is cached at the server or not. New command comes via new RPC endpoint `ArtifactStatus`. And the server answers by new message `ArtifactStatusesResponse`, see **base.proto**.\r\n\r\nThe client transfers serialized (in avro) body of local relation and its schema via the RPC endpoint `AddArtifacts`. On another hand, the server stores the received artifact in the block manager using the id `CacheId`. The last one has 3 parts:\r\n- `userId` - the identifier of the user that created the local relation,\r\n- `sessionId` - the identifier of the session which the relation belongs to,\r\n- `hash` - a `sha-256` hash over relation body.\r\n\r\nSee **SparkConnectArtifactManager.addArtifact()**.\r\n\r\nThe current query is blocked till the local relation is cached at the server side.\r\n\r\nWhen the server receives the query, it retrieves `userId`, `sessionId` and `hash` from `CachedLocalRelation`, and gets the local relation data from the block manager. See **SparkConnectPlanner.transformCachedLocalRelation()**.\r\n\r\nThe occupied blocks at the block manager are removed when an user session is invalidated in `userSessionMapping`. See **SparkConnectService.RemoveSessionListener** and **BlockManager.removeCache()`**.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow creating a dataframe from a large local collection. `spark.createDataFrame(...)` fails with the following error w/o the changes:\r\n```java\r\n23/04/21 20:32:20 WARN NettyServerStream: Exception processing message\r\norg.sparkproject.connect.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: gRPC message exceeds maximum size 134217728: 268435456\r\n\tat org.sparkproject.connect.grpc.Status.asRuntimeException(Status.java:526)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The changes extend the existing proto API.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMany databases and data warehouse SQL engines support temporary tables. A temporary table, as its named implied, is a short-lived table that its life will be only for current session. \r\n\r\n* [Hive Temporary Table](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.0.1/using-hiveql/content/hive_create_a_hive_temporary_table.html)\r\n* [Teradata Volatile Table](https://docs.teradata.com/reader/rgAb27O_xRmMVc_aQq2VGw/mpJF1z_vSlpMbZYxFmRJfA) \r\n* [PostgreSQL Temporary Table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createtable.html)\r\n\r\nIn Spark, there is no temporary table. the DDL “CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE AS SELECT” will create a temporary view. A temporary view is totally different with a temporary table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA temporary view is just a VIEW. It doesn’t materialize data in storage. So it has below shortage:\r\n\r\n1. View will not give improved performance. Materialize intermediate data in temporary tables for a complex query will accurate queries, especially in an ETL pipeline.\r\n2. View which calls other views can cause severe performance issues. Even, executing a very complex view may fail in Spark.\r\n3. Temporary view has no database namespace. In some complex ETL pipelines or data warehouse applications, without database prefix is not convenient. It needs some tables which only used in current session.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit tests.","created_at":"2023-04-17T14:00:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T00:22:35Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T00:22:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a61ff60d0901e32f07d898e6f7ad9088365a35a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

But Spark use custom `SparkParserErrorStrategy` will not throw `ParseCancellationException` but `ParseException` in some situation. So we should catch `ParseException` then to make sure parser use `LL` mode try again.\r\n\r\nFix sql parser throw `ParseException` in `SSL` mode will not try `LL` mode.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the most narrow fix for the issue observed in SPARK-43157. It does not attempt to identify or solve all potential correctness and concurrency issues from TreeNode.tags being modified in multiple places. It solves the issue described in  SPARK-43157 by cloning the cached plan when populating `InMemoryRelation.innerChildren`. I chose to do the clone at this point to limit the scope to tree traversal used for building up the string representation of the plan, which is where we see the issue. I do not see any other uses for `TreeNode.innerChildren`. I did not clone any earlier because the caching objects have mutable state that I wanted to avoid touching to be extra safe.\r\n\r\nAnother solution I tried was to modify `InMemoryRelation.clone` to create a new `CachedRDDBuilder` and pass in a cloned `cachedPlan`. I opted not to go with this approach because `CachedRDDBuilder` has mutable state that needs to be moved to the new object and I didn't want to add that complexity if not needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen caching is used the cached part of the SparkPlan is leaked to new clones of the plan. This leakage is an issue because if the TreeNode.tags are modified in one plan, it impacts the other plan. This is a correctness issue and a concurrency issue if the TreeNode.tags are set in different threads for the cloned plans.\r\n\r\nSee the description of [SPARK-43157](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43157) for an example of the concurrency issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It fixes a driver hanging issue the user can observe.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test added and I manually verified `Dataset.explain(\"formatted\")` still had the expected output.\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10).cache.filter($\"id\" > 5).explain(\"formatted\")\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* Filter (4)\r\n+- InMemoryTableScan (1)\r\n      +- InMemoryRelation (2)\r\n            +- * Range (3)\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) InMemoryTableScan\r\nOutput [1]: [id#0L]\r\nArguments: [id#0L], [(id#0L > 5)]\r\n\r\n(2) InMemoryRelation\r\nArguments: [id#0L], CachedRDDBuilder(org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.DefaultCachedBatchSerializer@418b946b,StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas),*(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n,None), [id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n\r\n(3) Range [codegen id : 1]\r\nOutput [1]: [id#0L]\r\nArguments: Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(16))\r\n\r\n(4) Filter [codegen id : 1]\r\nInput [1]: [id#0L]\r\nCondition : (id#0L > 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also verified that the `InMemory.innerChildren` is cloned when the entire plan is cloned.\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.execution.columnar.InMemoryTableScanExec\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\ndef findCacheOperator(plan: SparkPlan): Option[InMemoryTableScanExec] = {\r\n  if (plan.isInstanceOf[InMemoryTableScanExec]) {\r\n    Some(plan.asInstanceOf[InMemoryTableScanExec])\r\n  } else if (plan.children.isEmpty && plan.subqueries.isEmpty) {\r\n    None\r\n  } else {\r\n    (plan.subqueries.flatMap(p => findCacheOperator(p)) ++\r\n      plan.children.flatMap(findCacheOperator)).headOption\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nval df = spark.range(10).filter($\"id\" < 100).cache()\r\nval df1 = df.limit(1)\r\nval df2 = df.limit(1)\r\n\r\n// Get the cache operator (InMemoryTableScanExec) in each plan\r\nval plan1 = findCacheOperator(df1.queryExecution.executedPlan).get\r\nval plan2 = findCacheOperator(df2.queryExecution.executedPlan).get\r\n\r\n// Check if InMemoryTableScanExec references point to the same object\r\nprintln(plan1.eq(plan2))\r\n// returns false// Check if InMemoryRelation references point to the same object\r\n\r\nprintln(plan1.relation.eq(plan2.relation))\r\n// returns false\r\n\r\n// Check if the cached SparkPlan references point to the same object\r\nprintln(plan1.relation.innerChildren.head.eq(plan2.relation.innerChildren.head))\r\n// returns false\r\n// This shows the issue is fixed\r\n```","created_at":"2023-04-16T22:45:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-01T16:33:45Z","closed_at":"2023-05-18T06:25:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0eb86d6a00a5a2b13083e77bf4f6120fe0010f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ece9da206a0ede372846eb5156fcb0b30ec0093","head":{"label":"robreeves:roreeves/explain_util","ref":"roreeves/explain_util","sha":"0ece9da206a0ede372846eb5156fcb0b30ec0093","user":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524214006,"node_id":"R_kgDOHz7e9g","name":"spark","full_name":"robreeves/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix a correctness bug for scalar subqueries with COUNT and a GROUP BY clause, for example:\r\n```\r\ncreate view t1(c1, c2) as values (0, 1), (1, 2);\r\ncreate view t2(c1, c2) as values (0, 2), (0, 3);\r\n\r\nselect c1, c2, (select count(*) from t2 where t1.c1 = t2.c1 group by c1) from t1;\r\n\r\n-- Correct answer: [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, null)]\r\n+---+---+------------------+\r\n|c1 |c2 |scalarsubquery(c1)|\r\n+---+---+------------------+\r\n|0  |1  |2                 |\r\n|1  |2  |0                 |\r\n+---+---+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to a bug in our \"COUNT bug\" handling for scalar subqueries. For a subquery with COUNT aggregate but no GROUP BY clause, 0 is the correct output on empty inputs, and we use the COUNT bug handling to construct the plan that  yields 0 when there were no matched rows.\r\n\r\nBut when there is a GROUP BY clause then NULL is the correct output (i.e. there is no COUNT bug), but we still incorrectly use the COUNT bug handling and therefore incorrectly output 0. Instead, we need to only apply the COUNT bug handling when the scalar subquery had no GROUP BY clause.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need to track whether the scalar subquery has a GROUP BY, i.e. a non-empty groupingExpressions for the Aggregate node. This need to be checked before subquery decorrelation, because that adds the correlated outer refs to the group-by list so after that the group-by is always non-empty. We save it in a boolean in the ScalarSubquery node until later when we rewrite the subquery into a join in constructLeftJoins.\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug. This bug affected both the current DecorrelateInnerQuery framework and the old code (with spark.sql.optimizer.decorrelateInnerQuery.enabled = false), and this PR fixes both.\r\n\r\nThis bug affects scalar subqueries (in RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery), but lateral subqueries handle it correctly in DecorrelateInnerQuery. Related: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36113\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix a correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fix incorrect query results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd SQL tests and unit tests. (Note that there were 2 existing unit tests for queries of this shape, which had the incorrect results as golden results.)","created_at":"2023-04-16T21:18:30Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T12:12:10Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T01:42:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c159656a3a44c842302d6741cd70e32935b1a833","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6cd6d9958f54ea23124d0be0c255542b3c86d717","head":{"label":"jchen5:count-bug","ref":"count-bug","sha":"6cd6d9958f54ea23124d0be0c255542b3c86d717","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

user defined during the serialization of a `ClassTag` for the user defined class. The problem for serialization of the `ClassTag` a instance of `JavaSerializer`(https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ca2ddf3c2079dda93053e64070ebda1610aa1968/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/network/netty/NettyBlockTransferService.scala#L62) is used, but it never configured to use a class loader including user defined classes. This PR solves the issue by instead use a serializer from the SerializerManager which is configured to use the correct class loader.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this does not occur during normal block replication and only during decommission is that there is a workaround/hack in `BlockManager.doPutIterator` that replaces the `ClassTag` with a `ClassTag[Any]` when replicating that block https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ca2ddf3c2079dda93053e64070ebda1610aa1968/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManager.scala#L1657-L1664 But during RDD migration (and probably pro-active replication) it will use a different codepath and potentially send the correct ClassTag which leads to the unhandled exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe unhandled exception means that block replication does not work properly. Specifically cases where the block contains a user class and it not replicated at creation then the block will never successfully be migrated during decommission.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt fixes the bug. But also since it changes from a fixed `JavaSerializer` to instead use the `SerializerManager` the `NettyBlockTransferService` might now instead use `KryoSerializer` or some other user configured serializer for the metadata.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis modifies an existing spec to correctly check that replication happens for repl defined classes while removing the hack that erases the `ClassTag`.  Additionally I tested this manually on a hadoop cluster to check that it also solves the decommission migration issue. If some can point me to some better way to add a spec using user defined classes I would also like to add a unittest for it.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-16T12:50:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T13:26:03Z","closed_at":"2023-05-11T13:26:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a53eba1efbd50af72837b6b2b744bbfda4ceb67d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

read if they are integral types. The key idea here is that casting to either of these two types will not affect the result of join for integral types join keys. For example: `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)`, if the value of `bigIntCol` exceeds the range of int, the result of `try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` is `null`, and the result of  `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` in the join condition is `false`. The result is consistent with `cast(a.intCol AS bigint) = b.bigIntCol`.\r\n\r\nAfter This PR:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SortMergeJoin [i#6L],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nwhere hive table.getStorageHandler call is used, check hive table parameter \"storage_handler\" first.  purpose is that hive table.getStorageHandler initializes the storagehandler class, if not necessary can just check on hive table parameter first. the table parameter is required for storagehandler table in hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor desc table, or use case where user just want to load HiveTableRelation, user do not need to provide the storagehandler jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\npast unit tests and also local

What changes were proposed in this pull request? / Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Currently, the official Spark docker images run as the UID `185`, but no corresponding entry exists in `/etc/passwd`. This causes [issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41864985/hadoop-ioexception-failure-to-login) when libraries try to fetch the current unix username. \r\n- This PR invokes the `useradd` function as part of the `Dockerfile`, to ensure that a name exists for these users.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n- No. No user-facing changes are expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Docker build succeeds locally.","created_at":"2023-04-14T21:55:07Z","updated_at":"2023-04-24T16:50:09Z","closed_at":"2023-04-24T16:50:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38535a595744617d4de41c495ec3e3feefc4f162","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2363ff029f3e28aa863d4454dde6c6a38a44f66","head":{"label":"DerekTBrown:name_docker_users","ref":"name_docker_users","sha":"a2363ff029f3e28aa863d4454dde6c6a38a44f66","user":{"login":"DerekTBrown","id":6845676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDU2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6845676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown","html_url":"https://github.com/DerekTBrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":628075833,"node_id":"R_kgDOJW-tOQ","name":"spark","full_name":"DerekTBrown/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DerekTBrown","id":6845676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDU2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6845676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown","html_url":"https://github.com/DerekTBrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DerekTBrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DerekTBrown/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded the agg, reduce support in `KeyValueGroupedDataset`.\r\nAdded `Dataset#reduce`\r\nAdded `RelationalGroupedDataset#as`.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n* `KVGDS#agg`: `KVGDS#agg` and the `RelationalGroupedDS#agg` shares the exact same proto. The only difference is that the KVGDS always passing a UDF as the first grouping expression. That's also how we tell them apart in this PR.\r\n* `KVGDS#reduce`: Reduce is a special aggregation. The client uses an UnresolvedFunc \"reduce\" to mark the agg operator is a `ReduceAggregator` and calls `KVGDS#agg` directly. The server would be able to pick this func up directly and reuse the agg code path by sending in a `ReduceAggregator`.\r\n* `Dataset#reduce`: This is free after `KVGDS#reduce`.\r\n* `RelationalGroupedDS#as`: The only difference between `KVGDS` created using `ds#groupByKey` and `ds#agg#as` is the grouping expressions. The former requires one grouping func as the grouping expression, the latter uses a dummy func (to pass encoders/types to the server) + grouping expressions. Thus the server can count how many grouping expressions received and decide if the `KVGDS` should be created as `ds#groupByKey` or `ds#agg#as`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowups: \r\n* [SPARK-43415] Support mapValues in the Agg functions. \r\n* [SPARK-43416] The tupled ProductEncoder dose not pick up the fields names from the server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing APIs in Scala Client\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded `KeyValueGrouppedDataset#agg, reduce`, `Dataset#reduce`, `RelationalGroupedDataset#as` methods for the Scala client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nE2E

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes DSL expressions on attributes with special characters by making `DslAttr.attr` and `DslAttr.expr` return the implicitly wrapped attribute instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43142: DSL expressions on attributes with special characters don't work even if the attribute names are quoted:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\r\n\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAttribute = 'slashed/col\r\n\r\nscala> \"`slashed/col`\".attr.asc\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nmismatched input '/' expecting {<EOF>, '.', '-'}(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nslashed/col\r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nDSL expressions rely on a call to `expr` to get child of the new expression [(e.g.)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L149).\r\n\r\n`expr` here is a call on implicit class `DslAttr` that's wrapping the `UnresolvedAttribute` returned by `\"...\".attr` is wrapped by the implicit class `DslAttr`.\r\n\r\n`DslAttr` and its super class implement `DslAttr.expr` such that a new `UnresolvedAttribute` is created from `UnresolvedAttribute.name` of the wrapped attribute [(here)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5442f7ed96b11051d8a9333476d080054e5a0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L273-L280).\r\n\r\nBut that's no good, because `UnresolvedAttribute.name` drops the quotes and thus the newly created `UnresolvedAttribute` parses an identifier that should be quoted but isn't:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> \"`col/slash`\".attr.name\r\nres5: String = col/slash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDSL expressions on attributes with special characters no longer fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI couldn't find a suite testing the implicit classes in the DSL package, but the DSL package seems used widely enough that I'm confident this doesn't break existing behavior.\r\n\r\nLocally, I was able to reproduce with this test; it was failing before and passes now:\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"chained DSL expressions on attributes with special characters\") {\r\n  $\"`slashed/col`\".asc\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2023-04-14T13:43:45Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T20:15:12Z","closed_at":"2023-04-21T12:55:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"537a789edc9ba718161af39b2195b92f18b6a7b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95741faf4109e83e3c0057b34bd368130bcd8094","head":{"label":"rshkv:wr/spark-43142","ref":"wr/spark-43142","sha":"95741faf4109e83e3c0057b34bd368130bcd8094","user":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":243588217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDM1ODgyMTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"rshkv/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`TorchDistributorLocalUnitTestsOnConnect` and `TorchDistributorLocalUnitTestsIIOnConnect` were not stable and occasionally got stuck. However, I can not reproduce the issue locally.\r\n\r\nThe two UTs were disabled, and this PR is to reenable them. I found that the all the tests for PyTorch set up the regular sessions or connect sessions in `setUp` and close them in `tearDown`, however such session operations are very expensive and should be placed into `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` instead. After this change, the related tests seems much stable. So I think the root cause is still related to the resources, since TorchDistributor works on barrier mode, when there is not enough resources in Github Action, the tests just keep waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor test coverage\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supports the `array_insert` and `array_prepend`. Users insert an element into the head of array is common operation. Considered, we want make `array_prepend` reuse the implementation of `array_insert`, but it seems a bit performance worse if the position is foldable and equals to zero.\r\nThe reason is that always do the check for position is negative or positive, and the code is too long. Too long code will lead to JIT failed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove `ArrayInsert` if the position is foldable and equals to zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust change the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-14T03:53:15Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T02:53:11Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T02:53:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b225a67613b3ef0ba17022cb39eef23ddf1f6c54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5bf66e54d3f0e70888578b90d908c49133313ff","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-43137","ref":"SPARK-43137","sha":"c5bf66e54d3f0e70888578b90d908c49133313ff","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the `await_termination()` and `exception()` to streaming query class. \r\n\r\nFor `exception`, only pass the `message` the same way in `SparkConnectService`, and construct the error the same way as the `convert_exception` method in `_handle_rpc_error` in `client.py`. \r\n\r\nFor `await_termination`, send the command multiple times instead of waiting to prevent RPC timeout. `<-- I'm definitely open to any discussion on its implementation!`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd missing APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but part of ongoing developing of Streaming Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests. Note that the unit tests for them are still skipped because of 1. queryManager is not implemented. 2. Allow access to stopped query is not implemented.\r\n\r\nI was able to test them manually by \r\n1. For `test_stream_await_termination()`, comment out the \r\n```\r\nfor q in self.spark.streams.active:\r\n    q.stop()\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For `test_stream_exception()`, comment out unregistering terminated query:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplements core streaming API in Scala for running streaming queries over Spark Connect. \r\nThis is functionally equivalent to Python side PR #40586 \r\n\r\nThere are no server side changes here since it was done earlier in Python PR.\r\n\r\nWe can run most streaming queries.\r\nNotably, queries using `foreachBatch()` are not yet supported.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis adds structured streaming support in Scala for Spark connect. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAdds more streaming API to Scala Spark Connect client. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n  - Unit test\r\n  - Manual testing\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-13T18:47:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T23:33:43Z","closed_at":"2023-04-19T23:33:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e7bfa4755497668628e840004676e71f20e75d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`DataSet.show()` currently triggers a job for a simple `show tables` command. This is because the command output contains an `isTemporary` boolean column that needs to be casted to string when we use `show()` on the dataset.\r\nThis PR converts `CommandResult` to `LocalRelation` and let `ConvertToLocalRelation` to do the casting locally to avoid triggering job execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA simple `show tables` shouldn not require an executor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark, we have defined some internal field metadata to help query resolution and compilation. For example, there are quite some field metadata that are related to metadata columns.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we create tables, these internal field metadata can be leaked. This PR updates CTAS/RTAS commands to remove these internal field metadata before creating tables. CREATE/REPLACE TABLE command is fine as users can't generate these internal field metadata via the type string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto avoid potential issues, like mistakenly treating a data column as metadata column\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes, the executors can not launch successfully because of the wrong configuration, but in K8s, Driver does not know that, and just keep requesting new executors.\r\n\r\nThis PR ports the window-based executor failure tracking mechanism to K8s(only takes effect when `spark.kubernetes.allocation.pods.allocator` is set to 'direct'), to reduce functionality gap between YARN and K8s.\r\n\r\nNote that, YARN mode also supports host-based executor allocation failure tracking and application terminating mechanism[2], this PR does not port such functionalities to Kubernetes since it's kind of an independent and big feature, and relies on some YARN features which I'm not sure if K8s has similar one.\r\n\r\n[1] [SPARK-6735](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6735)\r\n[2] [SPARK-17675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17675)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this PR provides two new configurations \r\n\r\n- `spark.executor.maxNumFailures`\r\n- `spark.executor.failuresValidityInterval`\r\n\r\nwhich takes effect on YARN, or on Kubernetes when `spark.kubernetes.allocation.pods.allocator` is set to 'direct'.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT added, and manually tested in internal K8s

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for tracking pinned blocks memory usage for RocksDB state store\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nToday we only track total memory usage for RocksDB that comprises of write buffer, block cache and index/filter blocks. Its also useful to understand usage of blocks pinned in the cache, potentially due to iterators not releasing them. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 11 seconds, 964 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 5\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe assert \r\n\r\n` assert(Thread.currentThread().isInstanceOf[UninterruptibleThread]) `\r\n \r\nfound https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/kafka-0-10-sql/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/KafkaMicroBatchStream.scala#L239 \r\n\r\n \r\nis not needed.  The reason is the following\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This assert was put there due to some issues when the old and deprecated KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer is used.  The default offset reader implementation has been changed to KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin which no longer require it run via UninterruptedThread.\r\n2. Even if the deprecated KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer is used, there are already asserts in that impl to check if it is running via UninterruptedThread e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/kafka-0-10-sql/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/KafkaOffsetReaderConsumer.scala#L130 thus the assert in KafkaMicroBatchStream is redundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemove unnecessary assert.  Clean up code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-13T03:45:47Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T08:10:04Z","closed_at":"2023-04-13T08:10:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8afc978143b42c9456277b8fea7e046bd3fa31e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `JoinCodegenSupport#getJoinCondition`, evaluate any referenced stream-side variables before using them in the generated code.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't evaluate the passed stream-side variables directly, but instead evaluates a copy (`streamVars2`). This is because `SortMergeJoin#codegenFullOuter` will want to evaluate the stream-side vars within a different scope than the condition check, so we mustn't delete the initialization code from the original `ExprCode` instances.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen a bound condition of a full outer join references the same stream-side column more than once, wholestage codegen generates bad code.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following query fails with a compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1 as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(1, 1),\r\n(2, 2),\r\n(3, 1)\r\nas v1(key, value);\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view v2 as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(1, 22, 22),\r\n(3, -1, -1),\r\n(7, null, null)\r\nas v2(a, b, c);\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom v1\r\nfull outer join v2\r\non key = a\r\nand value > b\r\nand value > c;\r\n```\r\nThe error is:\r\n```\r\norg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 277, Column 9: Redefinition of local variable \"smj_isNull_7\"\r\n```\r\nThe same error occurs with code generated from ShuffleHashJoinExec:\r\n```\r\nselect /*+ SHUFFLE_HASH(v2) */ *\r\nfrom v1\r\nfull outer join v2\r\non key = a\r\nand value > b\r\nand value > c;\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the error is:\r\n```\r\norg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 174, Column 5: Redefinition of local variable \"shj_value_1\" \r\n```\r\nNeither `SortMergeJoin#codegenFullOuter` nor `ShuffledHashJoinExec#doProduce` evaluate the stream-side variables before calling `consumeFullOuterJoinRow#getJoinCondition`. As a result, `getJoinCondition` generates definition/initialization code for each referenced stream-side variable at the point of use. If a stream-side variable is used more than once in the bound condition, the definition/initialization code is generated more than once, resulting in the \"Redefinition of local variable\" error.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the query succeeds, since Spark disables wholestage codegen and tries again.\r\n\r\n(In the case other join-type/strategy pairs, either the implementations don't call `JoinCodegenSupport#getJoinCondition`, or the stream-side variables are pre-evaluated before the call is made, so no error happens in those cases).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen doing an outer join with joinWith on DataFrames, unmatched rows return Row objects with null fields instead of a single null value. This is not a expected behavior, and it's a regression introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/cd92f25be5a221e0d4618925f7bc9dfd3bb8cb59).\r\nThis pull request aims to fix the regression, note this is not a full rollback of the commit, do not add back \"schema\" variable.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class ClassData(a: String, b: Int)\r\nval left = Seq(ClassData(\"a\", 1), ClassData(\"b\", 2)).toDF\r\nval right = Seq(ClassData(\"x\", 2), ClassData(\"y\", 3)).toDF\r\n\r\nleft.joinWith(right, left(\"b\") === right(\"b\"), \"left_outer\").collect\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWrong results (current behavior):    Array(([a,1],[null,null]), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\nCorrect results:                     Array(([a,1],null), ([b,2],[x,2]))\r\n```\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe need to address the regression mentioned above. It results in unexpected behavior changes in the Dataframe joinWith API between versions 2.4.8 and 3.0.0+. This could potentially cause data correctness issues for users who expect the old behavior when using Spark 3.0.0+.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test (use the same test in previous [closed pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35140), credit to Clément de Groc)\r\nRun sql-core and sql-catalyst submodules locally with ./build/mvn clean package -pl
