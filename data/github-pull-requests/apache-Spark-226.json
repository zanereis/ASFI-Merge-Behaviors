The threads inherit the `localProperties` from `sparkContext` as they are the child threads.\r\nThese threads are created in the executionContext (thread pools). Each Thread pool has a default `keepAliveSeconds` of 60 seconds for idle threads.\r\nScenarios where the thread pool has threads which are idle and reused for a subsequent new query, the thread local properties will not be inherited from spark context (thread properties are inherited only on thread creation) hence end up having old or no properties set. This will cause `SubqueryBroadcastExec#executionContext` local properties to be missing or stale\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SubqueryExec#relationFuture` make a copy of `org.apache.spark.SparkContext#localProperties` and pass it to the sub-execution thread in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SubqueryExec#executionContext`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLocal properties set via sparkContext are not available as TaskContext properties when executing  jobs and threadpools have idle threads which are reused\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nWhen `SubqueryExec`, the relationFuture is evaluated via a separate thread. The threads inherit the `localProperties` from `sparkContext` as they are the child threads.\r\nThese threads are created in the `executionContext` (thread pools). Each Thread pool has a default keepAliveSeconds of 60 seconds for idle threads.\r\nScenarios where the thread pool has threads which are idle and reused for a subsequent new query, the thread local properties will not be inherited from spark context (thread properties are inherited only on thread creation) hence end up having old or no properties set. This will cause taskset properties to be missing when properties are transferred by child thread via `sparkContext.runJob/submitJob`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen user config spark.sql.catalogImplementation with value not in in-memory/hive, check if below properties is configured. If configured then instantiate SessionState with provided Class, or else throw Exception as usual. \r\n```\r\nspark.sql.catalogImplementation.[value of spark.sql.catalogImplementation].builder\r\nspark.sql.catalogImplementation.[value of spark.sql.catalogImplementation].externalCatalog\r\n```\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.catalogImplementation = qihoo\r\nspark.sql.catalogImplementation.qihoo.builder = org.apache.spark.sql.qihoo.QihooSessionStateBuilder\r\nspark.sql.catalogImplementation.qihoo.externalCatalog = org.apache.spark.sql.qihoo.QihooExternalCatalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have implemented a complex ExternalCatalog which is used for retrieving multi isomerism database's metadata(sush as elasticsearch、postgresql), so that we can make a mixture query between hive and our online data. But as spark require that value of spark.sql.catalogImplementation must be one of in-memory/hive, we have to modify SparkSession and rebuild spark to make our project work.\r\nFinally, we hope spark removing above restriction, so that it's will be much easier to let us keep pace with new spark version. Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-23T09:39:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T01:30:41Z","closed_at":"2020-01-24T00:16:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a713d3e71db7fdef0d3d4e6c03f0a3697027e4b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e02beea3a72af17adb47be7e8aedf5d51107174","head":{"label":"WeiWenda:branch-2.4","ref":"branch-2.4","sha":"0e02beea3a72af17adb47be7e8aedf5d51107174","user":{"login":"WeiWenda","id":16742851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQyODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16742851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda","html_url":"https://github.com/WeiWenda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171609843,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2MDk4NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"WeiWenda/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeiWenda","id":16742851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQyODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16742851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda","html_url":"https://github.com/WeiWenda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiWenda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeiWenda/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27307\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to address four things. Three issues and fixes were a bit mixed so this PR sorts it out. See also http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Adding-Maven-Central-mirror-from-Google-to-the-build-td28728.html for the discussion in the mailing list.\r\n\r\n1. Add the Google Maven Central mirror (GCS) as a primary repository. This will not only help development more stable but also in order to make Github Actions build (where it is always required to download jars) stable. In case of Jenkins PR builder, it wouldn't be affected too much as it uses the pre-downloaded jars under `.m2`.\r\n\r\n    - Google Maven Central seems stable for heavy workload but not synced very quickly (e.g., new release is missing)\r\n    - Maven Central (default) seems less stable but synced quickly.\r\n\r\n    We already added this GCS mirror as a default additional remote repository at SPARK-29175. So I don't see an issue to add it as a repo.\r\n    https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/abf759a91e01497586b8bb6b7a314dd28fd6cff1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SQLConf.scala#L2111-L2118\r\n\r\n2. Currently, we have the hard-corded repository in [`sbt-pom-reader`](https://github.com/JoshRosen/sbt-pom-reader/blob/v1.0.0-spark/src/main/scala/com/typesafe/sbt/pom/MavenPomResolver.scala#L32) and this seems overwriting Maven's existing resolver by the same ID `central` with `http://` when initially the pom file is ported into SBT instance. This uses `http://` which latently Maven Central disallowed (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27242)\r\n\r\n    My speculation is that we just need to be able to load plugin and let it convert POM to SBT instance with another fallback repo. After that, it _seems_ using `central` with `https` properly. See also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27307#issuecomment-576720395.\r\n\r\n    I double checked that we use `https` properly from the SBT build as well:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [debug] downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom ...\r\n    [debug] \tpublic: downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom\r\n    [debug] \tpublic: downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom.sha1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This was fixed by adding the same repo (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27281), `central_without_mirror`, which is a bit awkward. Instead, this PR adds GCS as a main repo, and community Maven central as a fallback repo. So, presumably the community Maven central repo is used when the plugin is loaded as a fallback.\r\n\r\n3. While I am here, I fix another issue. Github Action at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27279 is being failed. The reason seems to be scalafmt 1.0.3 is in Maven central but not in GCS.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    org.apache.maven.plugin.PluginResolutionException: Plugin org.antipathy:mvn-scalafmt_2.12:1.0.3 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Could not find artifact org.antipathy:mvn-scalafmt_2.12:jar:1.0.3 in google-maven-central (https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/repos/central/data/)\r\n        at org.apache.maven.plugin.internal.DefaultPluginDependenciesResolver.resolve     (DefaultPluginDependenciesResolver.java:131)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n   `mvn-scalafmt` exists in Maven central:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ curl https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd\">\r\n        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    whereas not in GCS mirror:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ curl https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/repos/central/data/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom\r\n    ```\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><Error><Code>NoSuchKey</Code><Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message><Details>No such object: maven-central/repos/central/data/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom</Details></Error>%\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    In this PR, simply make both repos accessible by adding to `pluginRepositories`.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the workarounds in Github Actions to switch mirrors because now we have same repos in the same order (Google Maven Central first, and Maven Central second)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds new UTs to prevent SPARK-29438 for streaming aggregation as well as flatMapGroupsWithState, as we agree about the review comment quote here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26162#issuecomment-576929692\r\n\r\n> LGTM for this PR. But on a additional note, this is a very subtle and easy-to-make bug with TaskContext.getPartitionId. I wonder if this bug is present in any other stateful operation. I wonder if this bug is present in any other stateful operation. Can you please verify how partitionId is used in the other stateful operations?\r\n\r\nFor now they're not broken, but even better if we have UTs to prevent the case for the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNew UTs will prevent streaming aggregation and flatMapGroupsWithState to be broken in future where it is placed on the right side of UNION and the number of partition is changing on the left side of UNION. Please refer SPARK-29438 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a section to the Configuration page to document configurations for executor metrics.\r\nAt the same time, rename spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorProcessTreeMetrics.enabled to spark.executor.processTreeMetrics.enabled and make it independent of spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorMetrics.enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExecutor metrics are new in Spark 3.0. They lack documentation.\r\nMemory metrics as a whole are always collected, but the ones obtained from the process tree have to be optionally enabled. Making this depend on a single configuration makes for more intuitive behavior. Given this, the configuration property is renamed to better reflect its meaning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, only in that the configurations are all new to 3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-22T23:42:36Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T21:55:15Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T20:28:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e6e01c67060df726bbdd9834a7568735cdd5228","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e134dd1a81e2b9ec20c3f3bfe2bb76172a4a639","head":{"label":"wypoon:SPARK-27324","ref":"SPARK-27324","sha":"5e134dd1a81e2b9ec20c3f3bfe2bb76172a4a639","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108919243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg5MTkyNDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wypoon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit b5cb9abdd5ee286cc2b0a06cb5f3eac812922a31.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe merged commit (#27243) was too risky for several reasons:\r\n 1. It doesn't fix a bug\r\n 2. It makes the resolution of the table that's going to be altered a child. We had avoided this on purpose as having an arbitrary rule change the child of AlterTable seemed risky. This change alone is a big -1 for me for this change.\r\n 3. While the code may look cleaner, I think this approach makes certain things harder, e.g. differentiating between the Hive based Alter table CHANGE COLUMN and ALTER COLUMN syntax. Resolving and normalizing columns for ALTER COLUMN also becomes a bit harder, as we now have to check every single AlterTable command instead of just a single ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN statement\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests\r\n\r\nThis closes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip resolving the merge expressions if the target is a DSv2 table with ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA capability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome DSv2 sources may want to customize the merge resolution logic. For example, a table that can accept any schema (TableCapability.ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA) may want to allow certain merge queries that are blocked (that is, throws AnalysisError) by the default resolution logic. So there should be a way to completely bypass the merge resolution logic in the Analyzer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, since merge itself is an unreleased feature\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded unit test to specifically test the skipping.","created_at":"2020-01-22T21:12:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T03:50:21Z","closed_at":"2020-01-23T03:21:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"613bd914708ff276c885226b915d150a0cef3a30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/efce93b05a7c047572bcbb6ce710df4ee081ab9e","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-30609","ref":"SPARK-30609","sha":"efce93b05a7c047572bcbb6ce710df4ee081ab9e","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

Instead of `\"[true]\" did not equal \"[false]\"`, it looks like `\"[ertu]\" did not equal \"[aefls]\"`.\r\n* Output of expression examples should be always the same except nondeterministic

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd FValue selection for continuous distribution features.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent Spark only supports the selection of categorical features, while there are many requirements for the selection of continuous distribution features.\r\n\r\nANOVA F-value is one way to select features from the continuous distribution and it's important to support it in spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMove the `defaultNamespace` method from the interface `SupportsNamespace` to `CatalogPlugin`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhile I'm implementing JDBC V2, I realize that the default namespace is a very important information. Even if you don't want to implement namespace manipulation functionalities like CREATE/DROP/ALTER namespace, you still need to report the default namespace to Spark.\r\n\r\nThe default namespace is not about functionality but a matter of correctness. If you don't know the default namespace of a catalog, it's wrong to assume it's `[]`. You may get table not found exception if you do so.\r\n\r\nI think it's more reasonable to put the `defaultNamespace` method in the base class `CatalogPlugin`. It returns `[]` by default so won't bother implementation if they really don't have namespace concept.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, but for an unreleased API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'd propose to fully support interval for the CSV and JSON functions. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, CSV and JSON records consist of string values, in the cast logic, we can cast string from/to interval now, so we can make those functions support intervals easily.\r\n\r\nBefore this change we can only use this as a workaround.\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT cast(from_csv('1, 1 day', 'a INT, b string').b as interval)\r\nstruct<CAST(from_csv(1, 1 day).b AS INTERVAL):interval>\r\n1 days\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,  we ban reading or writing intervals from CSV and JSON files. To directly read and write  with external json/csv storage, you still need explicit cast, e.g.\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a string\").json(\"a.json\").selectExpr(\"cast(a as interval)\").show\r\n+------+\r\n|     a|\r\n+------+\r\n|1 days|\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfor interval's future-proofing purpose\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, the `to_json`/`from_json` function can deal with intervals now. e.g.\r\nfor `from_json` there is no such use case because we do not support `a interval` \r\nfor `to_json`, we can use interval values now \r\n\r\n#### before\r\n\r\n ```sql\r\n\r\n SELECT to_json(map('a', interval 25 month 100 day 130 minute));\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'to_json(map('a', INTERVAL '2 years 1 months 100 days 2 hours 10 minutes'))' due to data type mismatch: Unable to convert column a of type interval to JSON.; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(to_json(map(a, 2 years 1 months 100 days 2 hours 10 minutes), Some(Asia/Shanghai)), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n#### after\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT to_json(map('a', interval 25 month 100 day 130 minute))\r\n{\"a\":\"2 years 1 months 100 days 2 hours 10 minutes\"}\r\n\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is another PR for stage level scheduling. In particular this adds changes to the dynamic allocation manager and the scheduler backend to be able to track what executors are needed per ResourceProfile.  Note the api is still private to Spark until the entire feature gets in, so this functionality will be there but only usable by tests for profiles other then the DefaultProfile.\r\n\r\nThe main changes here are simply tracking things on a ResourceProfile basis as well as sending the executor requests to the scheduler backend for all ResourceProfiles. \r\n\r\nI introduce a ResourceProfileManager in this PR that will track all the actual ResourceProfile objects so that we can keep them all in a single place and just pass around and use in datastructures the resource profile id. The resource profile id can be used with the ResourceProfileManager to get the actual ResourceProfile contents. \r\n\r\nThere are various places in the code that use executor \"slots\" for things.  The ResourceProfile adds functionality to keep that calculation in it.   This logic is more complex then it should due to standalone mode and mesos coarse grained not setting the executor cores config. They default to all cores on the worker, so calculating slots is harder there.  \r\nThis PR keeps the functionality to make the cores the limiting resource because the scheduler still uses that for \"slots\" for a few things.\r\n\r\nThis PR does also add the resource profile id to the Stage and stage info classes to be able to test things easier.   That full set of changes will come with the scheduler PR that will be after this one.\r\n\r\nThe PR stops at the scheduler backend pieces for the cluster manager and the real YARN support hasn't been added in this PR, that again will be in a separate PR, so this has a few of the API changes up to the cluster manager and then just uses the default profile requests to continue.\r\n\r\nThe code for the entire feature is here for reference: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27053/files although it needs to be upmerged again as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNeeded for stage level scheduling feature.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo user facing api changes added here.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLots of unit tests and manually testing. I tested on yarn, k8s, standalone, local modes. Ran both failure and success cases.","created_at":"2020-01-21T20:20:14Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T10:21:51Z","closed_at":"2020-02-12T22:46:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ae87595bee533d3abd57968f47a7c0b6382e30c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606875,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2ODc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SCHEDULER","name":"SCHEDULER","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/15f4c96b06e887913dc3c8ede8d385bfae514db9","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-29148","ref":"SPARK-29148","sha":"15f4c96b06e887913dc3c8ede8d385bfae514db9","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIncreased the limit for log events that could be stored in `SparkFunSuite.LogAppender` from 100 to 1000.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes (see traces in SPARK-30599) additional info is logged via log4j, and appended to `LogAppender`. For example, unusual log entries are:\r\n```\r\n[36] Removed broadcast_214_piece0 on 192.168.1.66:52354 in memory (size: 5.7 KiB, free: 2003.8 MiB)\r\n[37] Removed broadcast_204_piece0 on 192.168.1.66:52354 in memory (size: 5.7 KiB, free: 2003.9 MiB)\r\n[38] Removed broadcast_200_piece0 on 192.168.1.66:52354 in memory (size: 3.7 KiB, free: 2003.9 MiB)\r\n[39] Removed broadcast_207_piece0 on 192.168.1.66:52354 in memory (size: 24.2 KiB, free: 2003.9 MiB)\r\n[40] Removed broadcast_208_piece0 on 192.168.1.66:52354 in memory (size: 24.2 KiB, free: 2003.9 MiB)\r\n```\r\nand a test which uses `LogAppender` can fail with the exception:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Number of events reached the limit of 100 while logging CSV header matches to schema w/ enforceSchema.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy re-running `\"SPARK-23786: warning should be printed if CSV header doesn't conform to schema\"` in a loop.","created_at":"2020-01-21T18:57:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:55Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T22:28:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bade5bb1549b427e93681c06f2166da5273c934e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds method `updateProtocolFromHeader(request: HttpServletRequest, url: String): String` to JettyUtils.scala and calls this method from when Spark History Server is generating a redirect response.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is needed to address bug SPARK-27996 in History Server. Please note that similar change is likely needed in Spark UI. The scope of this PR is only to address the problem in History Server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, the Spark History server deployed in Kubernetes now correctly opens the job page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by building and deploying Spark History Server to Kubernetes cluster and then observing the behavior of the History Server UI. The regression testing was not performed. I will appreciate is someone can can confirm the Spark History Server still works when deployed on regular infrastructure (e.g. not behind the reverse proxy).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-21T18:38:22Z","updated_at":"2020-05-10T00:11:33Z","closed_at":"2020-05-10T00:11:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9579e22d8244c6494849bd3283ebda3730c7525c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe improvement in this is PR can extract equalities from join conditions so that we can recognise implicit equijoins.\r\n\r\nE.g. this example query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = 2 AND t2.c2 = 2\r\n```\r\nhas the following plan currently:\r\n```\r\nBroadcastNestedLoopJoin BuildRight, FullOuter, ((c2#226 = 2) AND (c2#237 = 2))\r\n:- *(1) Project [_1#220 AS c#225, _2#221 AS c2#226]\r\n:  +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n+- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode, [id=#146]\r\n   +- *(2) Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS c2#237]\r\n      +- *(2) LocalTableScan [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n```\r\nBut if we take\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = 2 AND t2.c2 = 2 AND t1.c2 = t2.c2\r\n```\r\nwhere the equality between the sides explicitly defined (`t1.c2 = t2.c2`) the plan is:\r\n```\r\nSortMergeJoin [c#225], [c#236], FullOuter, ((c2#226 = 2) AND (c2#237 = 2))\r\n:- *(2) Sort [c#225 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(c#225, 5), true, [id=#101]\r\n:     +- *(1) Project [_1#220 AS c#225, _2#221 AS c2#226]\r\n:        +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n+- *(4) Sort [c#236 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(c#236, 5), true, [id=#106]\r\n      +- *(3) Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS c2#237]\r\n         +- *(3) LocalTableScan [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n```\r\nThe second plan is better as SMJ doesn't have the broadcast size limitation as BNLJ do.\r\nAfter this PR the implicit equalities are detected and the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to address four things. Three issues and fixes were a bit mixed so this PR sorts it out. See also http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Adding-Maven-Central-mirror-from-Google-to-the-build-td28728.html for the discussion in the mailing list.\r\n\r\n1. Add the Google Maven Central mirror (GCS) as a primary repository. This will not only help development more stable but also in order to make Github Actions build (where it is always required to download jars) stable. In case of Jenkins PR builder, it wouldn't be affected too much as it uses the pre-downloaded jars under `.m2`.\r\n\r\n    - Google Maven Central seems stable for heavy workload but not synced very quickly (e.g., new release is missing)\r\n    - Maven Central (default) seems less stable but synced quickly.\r\n\r\n    We already added this GCS mirror as a default additional remote repository at SPARK-29175. So I don't see an issue to add it as a repo.\r\n    https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/abf759a91e01497586b8bb6b7a314dd28fd6cff1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SQLConf.scala#L2111-L2118\r\n\r\n2. Currently, we have the hard-corded repository in [`sbt-pom-reader`](https://github.com/JoshRosen/sbt-pom-reader/blob/v1.0.0-spark/src/main/scala/com/typesafe/sbt/pom/MavenPomResolver.scala#L32) and this seems overwriting Maven's existing resolver by the same ID `central` with `http://` when initially the pom file is ported into SBT instance. This uses `http://` which latently Maven Central disallowed (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27242)\r\n\r\n    My speculation is that we just need to be able to load plugin and let it convert POM to SBT instance with another fallback repo. After that, it _seems_ using `central` with `https` properly. See also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27307#issuecomment-576720395.\r\n\r\n    I double checked that we use `https` properly from the SBT build as well:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [debug] downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom ...\r\n    [debug] \tpublic: downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom\r\n    [debug] \tpublic: downloading https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/etsy/sbt-checkstyle-plugin_2.10_0.13/3.1.1/sbt-checkstyle-plugin-3.1.1.pom.sha1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This was fixed by adding the same repo (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27281), `central_without_mirror`, which is a bit awkward. Instead, this PR adds GCS as a main repo, and community Maven central as a fallback repo. So, presumably the community Maven central repo is used when the plugin is loaded as a fallback.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. While I am here, I fix another issue. Github Action at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27279 is being failed. The reason seems to be scalafmt 1.0.3 is in Maven central but not in GCS.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    org.apache.maven.plugin.PluginResolutionException: Plugin org.antipathy:mvn-scalafmt_2.12:1.0.3 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Could not find artifact org.antipathy:mvn-scalafmt_2.12:jar:1.0.3 in google-maven-central (https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/repos/central/data/)\r\n        at org.apache.maven.plugin.internal.DefaultPluginDependenciesResolver.resolve     (DefaultPluginDependenciesResolver.java:131)\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n   `mvn-scalafmt` exists in Maven central:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ curl https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd\">\r\n        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    whereas not in GCS mirror:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    $ curl https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/repos/central/data/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom\r\n    ```\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><Error><Code>NoSuchKey</Code><Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message><Details>No such object: maven-central/repos/central/data/org/antipathy/mvn-scalafmt_2.12/1.0.3/mvn-scalafmt_2.12-1.0.3.pom</Details></Error>%\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    In this PR, simply make both repos accessible by adding to `pluginRepositories`.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the workarounds in Github Actions to switch mirrors because now we have same repos in the same order (Google Maven Central first, and Maven Central second)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the build and Github Action more stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI roughly checked local and PR against my fork (https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/2 and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf `updateBlockInfo` returns false, which means the `BlockManager` will re-register and report all blocks later. So, we may report two times for the same block, which causes `AppStatusListener` to count used memory for two times, too. As a result, the used memory can exceed the total memory.\r\nSo, this PR changes it to not post `SparkListenerBlockUpdated` when `updateBlockInfo` returns false. And, always clean up used memory whenever `AppStatusListener` receives `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix negative memory usage in UI (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3488126/72131225-95e37e00-33b6-11ea-8708-6e5ed328d1ca.png, see #27144 ). Though, I'm not very sure this is the root cause for #27144 since known information is limited here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new tests by @xuanyuanking

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n(This is another approach of #27233) This PR intends to fix a bug when empty input given in group analytical queries (e.g., GROUPING SETS). For example, a query below with empty input has a different answer between Spark and PostgreSQL:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# create table gstest_empty (a integer, b integer, v integer);\r\nCREATE TABLE\r\npostgres=# select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),());\r\n a | b | sum | count \r\n---+---+-----+-------\r\n   |   |     |     0\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),())\"\"\").show\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n|  a|  b|sum(v)|count(1)|\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n```\r\nIn the case, we should follow the PostgreSQL answer. To fix this, this PR modified the existing resolution rules (`ResolveGroupingAnalytics` and `ResolveAggregateFunctions`) to rewrite it as an union query of aggregates with/without keys as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),())\"\"\").explain(true)\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: int, sum(v): bigint, count(1): bigint\r\nUnion\r\n:- Aggregate [a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7], [a#10, b#11, sum(cast(v#3 as bigint)) AS sum(v)#5L, count(1) AS count(1)#6L]\r\n:  +- Expand [List(v#3, a#1, b#2, 0)], [v#3, a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7]\r\n:     +- Project [v#3, a#1, b#2]\r\n:        +- Relation[a#1,b#2,v#3] parquet\r\n+- Aggregate [null AS a#10, null AS b#11, sum(cast(v#3 as bigint)) AS sum(v)#5L, count(1) AS count(1)#6L]\r\n   +- Project [v#3]\r\n      +- Relation[a#1,b#2,v#3] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: This pr also updates the existing test in `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuerySuite`; it has [the rollup query](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27233/files#diff-7d340edd739a1f59d51d5228113fd9edL120) and this PR transforms it into a `union(aggregate with keys, aggregate without keys)` form. The test checks that no metadata-only query happens there, but the `aggregate without keys` side can be optimized by the `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery` rule then `testNotMetadataOnly()` fails. To avoid this case, this PR replaces the rollup query with a grouping set one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor the correct SQL semantics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUTs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd replace 'loadV2SessionCatalog' with 'loadSessionCatalog'  in CatalogManager which is used to load any session catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCatalogs.load is called to load a catalog which is not 'spark_catalog' . If the catalog has implemented CatalogExtension, setDelegateCatalog is not called when the catalog is loaded, that is not like what we have done for v2SessionCatalog, and that makes a confusion for customized session catalog, like iceberg SparkSessionCatalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr removes the nonstandard `SET OWNER` syntax for namespaces and changes the owner reserved properties from `ownerName` and `ownerType` to `owner`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nthe `SET OWNER` syntax for namespaces is hive-specific and non-sql standard, we need a more future-proofing design before we implement user-facing changes for SQL security issues\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno, just revert an unpublic syntax\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmodified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument CLUSTER BY clause of SELECT statement in SQL Reference Guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to output additional msg from the tests where a log appender is added. The message is printed as a part of `IllegalStateException` in the case of reaching the limit of maximum number of logged events.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf a log appender is not removed from the log4j appenders list. the caller message could help to investigate the problem and find the test which doesn't remove the log appender.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites `AvroSuite`, `CSVSuite`, `ResolveHintsSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make `JsonSuite` and `CSVSuite` abstract classes, and add sub-classes that check JSON/CSV datasource v1 and v2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage and test JSON/CSV v1 which is still supported, and can be enabled by users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suites `JsonV1Suite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are scenarios where Spark History Server is located behind the VPC. So whenever api calls hit to get the executor Summary(allexecutors). There can be delay in getting the response of executor summary and in mean time \"stage-page-template.html\" is loaded and the response of executor Summary is not added to the stage-page-template.html.\r\n\r\nAs the result of which Aggregated Metrics by Executor in stage page is showing blank.\r\n\r\nThis scenario can be easily found in the cases when there is some proxy-server which is responsible for sending the request and response to spark History server.\r\nThis can be reproduced in Knox/In-house proxy servers which are used to send and receive response to Spark History Server.\r\n\r\nAlternative scenario to test this case, Open the spark UI in developer mode in browser add some breakpoint in stagepage.js, this will add some delay in getting the response and now if we check the spark UI for stage Aggregated Metrics by Executor in stage page is showing blank.\r\n\r\nSo In-order to fix this there is a need to add the change in stagepage.js . There is a need to add the api call to get the html page(stage-page-template.html) first and after that other api calls to get the data that needs to attached in the stagepage (like executor Summary, stageExecutorSummaryInfoKeys exc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince stage page is useful for debugging purpose, This helps in understanding how many task ran on the particular executor and information related to shuffle read and write on that executor. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested. Testing this in a reproducible way requires a running browser or HTML rendering engine that executes the JavaScript.Open the spark UI in developer mode in browser add some breakpoint in stagepage.js, this will add some delay in getting the response and now if we check the spark UI for stage Aggregated Metrics by Executor in stage page is showing blank.\r\n\r\nBefore fix \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1529\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument SORT BY clause of SELECT statement in SQL Reference Guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument ORDER BY clause of SELECT statement in SQL Reference Guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument HAVING clause of SELECT statement in SQL Reference Guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument GROUP BY clause of SELECT statement in SQL Reference Guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a fallback Maven repository when a mirror to `central` fail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe use `Google Maven Central` in GitHub Action as a mirror of `central`.\r\nHowever, `Google Maven Central` sometimes doesn't have newly published artifacts\r\nand there is no guarantee when we get the newly published artifacts.\r\n\r\nBy duplicating `Maven Central` with a new ID, we can add a fallback Maven repository\r\nwhich is not mirrored by `Google Maven Central`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually testing with the new `Twitter` chill artifacts by switching `chill.version` from `0.9.3` to `0.9.5`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/twitter/chill*\r\n$ mvn compile | grep chill\r\nDownloading from google-maven-central:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26930 to fix a bug.\r\n\r\nWhen we create shuffle fetch requests, we first collect blocks until they reach the max size. Then we try to merge the blocks (the batch shuffle fetch feature) and split the merged blocks to several groups, to make sure each group doesn't reach the max numBlocks. For the last group, if it's smaller than the max numBlocks, put it back to the input list and deal with it again later.\r\n\r\nThe last step has a problem:\r\n1. if we put a merged block back to the input list and merge it again, it fails.\r\n2. when putting back some blocks, we should update `numBlocksToFetch`\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these 2 problems.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate the scalafmt plugin to 1.0.3 and use its new onlyChangedFiles feature rather than --diff\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOlder versions of the plugin either didn't work with scala 2.13, or got rid of the --diff argument and didn't allow for formatting only changed files\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThe /dev/scalafmt script no longer passes through arbitrary args, instead using the arg to select scala version.  The issue here is the plugin name literally contains the scala version, and doesn't appear to have a shorter way to refer to it.   If @srowen or someone else with better maven-fu has an idea I'm all ears.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually, e.g. edited a file and ran\r\n\r\ndev/scalafmt\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\ndev/scalafmt

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Adds following overloaded variants to Scala `o.a.s.sql.functions`:\r\n\r\n  - `percentile_approx(e: Column, percentage: Array[Double], accuracy: Long): Column`\r\n  - `percentile_approx(columnName: String, percentage: Array[Double], accuracy: Long): Column`\r\n  - `percentile_approx(e: Column, percentage: Double, accuracy: Long): Column`\r\n  - `percentile_approx(columnName: String, percentage: Double, accuracy: Long): Column`\r\n  - `percentile_approx(e: Column, percentage: Seq[Double], accuracy: Long): Column` (primarily for \r\nPython interop).\r\n  - `percentile_approx(columnName: String, percentage: Seq[Double], accuracy: Long): Column`\r\n\r\n- Adds `percentile_approx` to `pyspark.sql.functions`.\r\n\r\n- Adds `percentile_approx` function to SparkR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we support `percentile_approx` only in SQL expression. It is inconvenient and makes this function relatively unknown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew unit tests for SparkR an PySpark.\r\n\r\nAs for now there are no additional tests in Scala API ‒ `ApproximatePercentile` is well tested and Python (including docstrings) and R tests provide additional tests, so it seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-19T13:03:57Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T09:55:47Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T01:44:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"900c208c35435eedc0a806bea3ed20f172f7793b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6bd2d46ceb2539dd8e99e07268ce9e8fd6e6558","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-30569","ref":"SPARK-30569","sha":"b6bd2d46ceb2539dd8e99e07268ce9e8fd6e6558","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

with interval column types if the external catalog accepts which is varying the interval type's purpose for internal usage. With https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d67b98ea016e9b714bef68feaac108edd08159c9 's original purpose it should only work from cast logic.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding type checker for the interval type from commands to commands to work among catalogs, It much simpler to treat interval as an invalid data type but can be identified by cast only.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nenhance interval internal usage purpose.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO,\r\nAdditionally, this PR restores user behavior when using interval type to create/alter table schema, e.g. for hive catalog\r\nfor 2.4,\r\n```java\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nDataType calendarinterval is not supported.(line 1, pos 0)\r\n```\r\nfor master after  https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d67b98ea016e9b714bef68feaac108edd08159c9\r\n```java\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error: type expected at the position 0 of 'interval' but 'interval' is found.\r\n  at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.createTable(Hive.java:862)\r\n```\r\nnow with this pr, we restore the type checker in spark side.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose move out creation of `AvroOption` from `AvroPartitionReaderFactory.buildReader`, and create it earlier in `AvroScan.createReaderFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To avoid building `AvroOptions` from a map of Avro options and Hadoop conf per each partition.\r\n- If an instance of `AvroOptions` is built only once at the driver side, we could output warnings while parsing Avro options and don't worry about noisiness of the warnings. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SubqueryExec#relationFuture` make a copy of `org.apache.spark.SparkContext#localProperties` and pass it to the sub-execution thread in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SubqueryExec#executionContext`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLocal properties set via sparkContext are not available as TaskContext properties when executing  jobs and threadpools have idle threads which are reused\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nWhen `SubqueryExec`, the relationFuture is evaluated via a separate thread. The threads inherit the `localProperties` from `sparkContext` as they are the child threads.\r\nThese threads are created in the `executionContext` (thread pools). Each Thread pool has a default keepAliveSeconds of 60 seconds for idle threads.\r\nScenarios where the thread pool has threads which are idle and reused for a subsequent new query, the thread local properties will not be inherited from spark context (thread properties are inherited only on thread creation) hence end up having old or no properties set. This will cause taskset properties to be missing when properties are transferred by child thread via `sparkContext.runJob/submitJob`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.BroadcastExchangeExec#relationFuture` make a copy of `org.apache.spark.SparkContext#localProperties` and pass it to the broadcast execution thread in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.BroadcastExchangeExec#executionContext`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen executing `BroadcastExchangeExec`, the relationFuture is evaluated via a separate thread. The threads inherit the `localProperties` from `sparkContext` as they are the child threads.\r\nThese threads are created in the executionContext (thread pools). Each Thread pool has a default `keepAliveSeconds` of 60 seconds for idle threads.\r\nScenarios where the thread pool has threads which are idle and reused for a subsequent new query, the thread local properties will not be inherited from spark context (thread properties are inherited only on thread creation) hence end up having old or no properties set. This will cause taskset properties to be missing when properties are transferred by child thread via `sparkContext.runJob/submitJob`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nwhen resolving the `Assignment` of insert action in MERGE INTO, only resolve with the source table, to avoid ambiguous attribute failure if there is a same-name column in the target table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe insert action is used when NOT MATCHED, so it can't access the row from the target table anyway. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\non\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanged signature of `rawParser` passed to `FailureSafeParser`. I propose to change return type from `Seq` to `Iterable`. I took `Iterable` to easier port the changes on Scala collections 2.13. Also, I replaced `Seq` by `Option` in CSV datasource - `UnivocityParser`, and in JSON parser exception one place in the case when specified schema is `StructType`, and JSON input is an array. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Seq` is unnecessary requirement for return type from rawParser which may not have multiple rows per input like CSV datasource. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `JsonSuite`, `UnivocityParserSuite`, `JsonFunctionsSuite`, `JsonExpressionsSuite`, `CsvSuite`, and `CsvFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-17T16:29:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:52Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T04:59:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e9fc8793f6328666129809cb983b02e6d070603","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf5ab4e6bd66f5d09b6730831c3b3df058a5ab1f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:failuresafe-parser-seq","ref":"failuresafe-parser-seq","sha":"cf5ab4e6bd66f5d09b6730831c3b3df058a5ab1f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nadd a param `bootstrap` to control whether bootstrap samples are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent RF with numTrees=1 will directly build a tree using the orignial dataset,\r\n\r\nwhile with numTrees>1 it will use bootstrap samples to build trees.\r\n\r\nThis design is for training a DecisionTreeModel by the impl of RandomForest, however, it is somewhat strange.\r\n\r\nIn Scikit-Learn, there is a param [bootstrap](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) to control whether bootstrap samples are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, new param is added\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a method to control small file problem\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL always generate too many small files of insert type SQL result, here we add a control method to minimize the output file number automatic。\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nWhen set `spark.sql.files.mergeSmallFile.enabled=false`, \r\nwe will combine neighbouring small partition, then will reduce output small files \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly disable Arrow execution for the test of toPandas empty types.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe following list of changes will improve SQL execution performance when data is spilled on the disk:\r\n1)\tImplement lazy initialization of UnsafeSorterSpillReader - iterator on top of spilled rows:\r\n        ... During SortMergeJoin (Left Semi Join) execution, the iterator on the spill data is created but no iteration over the data is done.\r\n        ... Having lazy initialization of UnsafeSorterSpillReader will enable efficient processing of SortMergeJoin even if data is spilled onto disk. Unnecessary I/O will be avoided.\r\n2)\tDecrease initial memory read buffer size in UnsafeSorterSpillReader from 1MB to 1KB:\r\n... UnsafeSorterSpillReader constructor takes lot of time due to size of default 1MB memory read buffer.\r\n        ... The code already has logic to increase the memory read buffer if it cannot fit the data, so decreasing the size to 1K is safe and has positive performance impact.\r\n3)\tImprove memory utilization when spilling is enabled in ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrey\r\n        ... In the current implementation, when spilling is enabled, UnsafeExternalSorter object is created and then data moved from ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrey object into UnsafeExternalSorter and then ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrey object is emptied. Just before ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrey object is emptied there are both objects in the memory with the same data. That require double memory and there is duplication of data. This can be avoided.\r\n        ... In the proposed solution, when spark.sql.sortMergeJoinExec.buffer.in.memory.threshold is reached  adding new rows into ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray object stops. UnsafeExternalSorter object is created and new rows are added into this object. ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray object retains all rows already added into this object. This approach will enable better memory utilization and avoid unnecessary movement of data from one object into another.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTesting with TPC-DS 100 TB benchmark data set showed that some of SQLs (example query 14) are not able to run even with extremely large Spark executor memory.Spark spilling feature has to be enabled, in order to be able to process these SQLs. Processing of SQLs becomes extremely slow when spilling is enabled. The test of this solution with query 14 and enabled spilling on the disk, showed 500X performance improvements and it didn^Rt degrade performance of the other SQLs from TPC-DS benchmark.\r\n\r\nThe testing was done with micro-benchmark that simulates typical join scenario for 100000 rows when spilling is enabled. In this micro-benchmark the spilling will create three spill files. The test covered two scenarios: Scenario when patch is NOT applied, so micro-benchmark runs existing Spark code. Then, scenario when patch is applied. The average processing time of 100000 join rows without patch is **943989** milliseconds. The average processing time of 100000 joins rows when patch is applied is **426** milliseconds. Comparison of these two micro-benchmarks shows more than **2000 X** (943898/426 = 2215.72 X ) difference in performance. If the spilling produces more then three spill files, the performance difference would be even greater.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running TPC-DS SQLs with different data sets 10 TB and 100 TB\r\nBy running all Spark tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImplement common base ML classes (`Predictor`, `PredictionModel`, `Classifier`, `ClasssificationModel` `ProbabilisticClassifier`, `ProbabilisticClasssificationModel`, `Regressor`, `RegrssionModel`) for non-Java backends.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n- `Predictor` and `JavaClassifier` should be abstract as `_fit` method is not implemented.\r\n- `PredictionModel` should be abstract as `_transform` is not implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo provide extensions points for non-JVM algorithms, as well as a public (as opposed to `Java*` variants, which are commonly described in docstrings as private) hierarchy which can be used to distinguish between different classes of predictors.\r\n\r\nFor longer discussion see [SPARK-29212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29212) and / or https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25776.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt adds new base classes as listed above, but effective interfaces (method resolution order notwithstanding) stay the same. \r\n\r\nAdditionally \"private\" `Java*` classes in`ml.regression` and `ml.classification` have been renamed to follow PEP-8 conventions (added leading underscore).\r\n\r\nIt is for discussion if the same should be done to equivalent classes from `ml.wrapper`.\r\n\r\nIf we take `JavaClassifier` as an example, type hierarchy will change from \r\n\r\n![old pyspark ml classification JavaClassifier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1554276/72657093-5c0b0c80-39a0-11ea-9069-a897d75de483.png)\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n![new pyspark ml classification _JavaClassifier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1554276/72657098-64fbde00-39a0-11ea-8f80-01187a5ea5a6.png)\r\n\r\nSimilarly the old model\r\n\r\n![old pyspark ml classification JavaClassificationModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1554276/72657103-7513bd80-39a0-11ea-9ffc-59eb6ab61fde.png)\r\n\r\nwill become \r\n\r\n![new pyspark ml classification _JavaClassificationModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1554276/72657110-80ff7f80-39a0-11ea-9f5c-fe408664e827.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe runtime dynamic configuration command is modified.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.
