releases from being tagged as `latest`. The problem is that our version of [chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action) is 1.2.0 which does not support that configuration. `mark_as_latest` was introduced in version 1.6.0 and this PR bumps that dependency to match this version.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes

been some confusion around the state of the translations in the repo as well as within different builds (docker, pypi, official releases,...).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we assume that \"compiled\" or redundant files that can be generated don't belong in the repository, and should be baked as part of the build process.\r\n\r\nDone here:\r\n- removed all translation json files from the repo, so the same way as `.mo` (binary files compile from .po files, and used by the backend / pybable), .json files (used by the frontend/jed) aren't in the repo anymore\r\n- updated CI / docs / docker builds to build the translation the right way, make scripts DRY and referenced the scripts in ci/docs/docker builds\r\n- moved po2json stuff for the frontend under a `npm run build-translation` script so it's bundled with the app in superset-frontend\r\n- created an empty language pack for `en` that's empty, as opposed to a large json file of about 200kb that has a map of empty translation, this has a positive impact on the bootstrap payload size in original page load for the `en`

up https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28422 (which needs to be cherry-picked to remedy an issue, but can't include a migration).

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixed issue #28443 \r\nRenamed `db_engine_specs` parameter `allows_alias_to_source_column` to `order_by_allows_alias_to_source_column` and added the new parameter `group_by_allows_alias_to_source_column`.\r\n\r\nThe previous parameter is used to tell the SQLA generator to rename aliases used in `ORDER BY` statements with aggregations, to ensure that the source column is referenced. Some engines (e.g. Drill) needs to be able to do the same thing for aliases in `GROUP BY` statements.\r\n\r\nThe new parameter is used to tell the SQLA generator to rename any alias of a source column that is used in an aggregation in a `GROUP BY` statement, to ensure that the source column is referenced.\r\n\r\nAdded documentation of the new `group_by_allows_alias_to_source_column` parameter, and fixed errors in the documentation of `order_by_allows_alias_to_source_column`/(previously)`allows_alias_to_source_column`\r\n\r\nFor example this query\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name__\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-12 19-37-24](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14278584/d83ba91c-a23a-4621-80ac-ac1a9320aca9)\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-12 19-39-17](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14278584/6c02118f-b94e-43e3-9ccf-04de15517d8c)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Start Superset\r\n2. Navigate to the Superset web application and login\r\n3. Connect to a Drill database\r\n4. Create a dataset of the Drill database\r\n5. Create a chart from that dataset\r\n6. Select visualization type Table with query mode Aggregate\r\n7. Add two columns in the dimensions\r\n8. Aggregate the data of one of the columns (e.g. length(column_a))\r\n9. Press \"view query\"\r\n10. The query should now contain a GROUP BY statement of an aggregation, and the alias of that aggregation should have \"__\" at the end of the name.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name__\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

Although the current impl would allow for the proper encryption of fields in the `SSHTunnel` model, anyone that's implemented a custom field via `EncryptedFieldFactory.create()` would have been broken

SUMMARY\r\nIt currently requires granting `can_expore on Superset` permission to users in order to enable D2D operations (Drill by and Drill to Detail). Some organizations might want to expose this control without necessarily exposing charts/the ability to access Explore.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes an alternative permission that can be used to enable D2D operations without granting the `can_expore` perm.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTests added. For manual testing:\r\n1. Create a role that have required all the required perms for D2D operations (including the `can_expore on Superset` permission).\r\n2. Replace this permission with the `can_drill on Dashboard` perm.\r\n3. Log in with an account that is associated with this role and validate that D2D operations are available.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of of [[SIP-50] Proposal for using ECharts as our main charting library](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/10418), we're currently testing Line and Area chart migrations using Airbnb's production data. During these tests, we found many problems when comparing how legacy and ECharts plugins calculate and display time shifts. This PR fixes the following issues:\r\n\r\n### Time shifts when the their granularity do not match the chart's granularity\r\n\r\nIn this example, we have a chart with a monthly granularity but with a 52 weeks offset. This is how the legacy line chart correctly renders the chart:\r\n<img width=\"1014\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 35 24\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/eee9cf45-f240-475e-8c06-404eb4ade191\">\r\n<br>The ECharts line chart was incorrectly calculating the time shift when applying the 52 weeks offset due to differences in terms of granularity. Observe how the peak in November 2003 (296) does not match the time shift in 2004 (70).\r\n<img width=\"1020\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 57 56\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/2a01f968-1b85-4d8e-827c-fd83470d1b16\">\r\n<br>Now the ECharts line chart correctly calculates the time shift and matches its legacy version.\r\n<img width=\"1021\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 35 52\" \r\nsrc=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/041b42ab-b0bb-4360-b5d5-8d79c1b8629e\">\r\n\r\n### How time shifts are displayed when there's missing data\r\nPreviously, when time shift data was not available, the chart was rendered with line gaps which is different than the legacy version. \r\n<img width=\"1016\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 37 19\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/719afb61-8aca-4ec0-991b-47847d89c17b\">\r\n<br>Now, the line gaps are gone and the dots are connected without a data point which is exactly how the legacy chart displays this scenario.\r\n<img width=\"1021\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 35 52\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/041b42ab-b0bb-4360-b5d5-8d79c1b8629e\">\r\n<br>There is also an error about how the legacy version displays missing data depending on the chosen granularity. In this example we have a chart with daily granularity and we only have time shift data for some data points. The legacy chart displays a line for every data point and assumes that the time shift is the same as the series which is not correct.\r\n<img width=\"1020\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 32 53\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/5422e669-5000-4ef9-8261-026053bee9b4\">\r\n<br>With this fix, only available time shifts are displayed and the tooltip display the correct information when a time shift is not available.\r\n<img width=\"1029\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 33 37\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/870547f1-d7e1-4c23-b5c8-df22cd372247\">\r\n\r\n### How multiple time shifts are displayed\r\nPreviously, multiple time shifts were displayed using the same line pattern, which is confusing and require users to check the tooltips to see the actual time shift.\r\n<img width=\"1022\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 52 42\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/a4f9562f-64e6-4d62-8337-ea312436ba25\">\r\n<br>Now, it behaves exactly as the legacy version where each time shift is displayed using a different line pattern.\r\n<img width=\"1024\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 51 19\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/31edea76-94cb-4b3a-92f5-fbd7ac48d95e\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo test the PR use the Advanced Analytics controls and play with different time shift settings. I tested the algorithm using Airbnb's production data using more than 100 charts and added extra unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDisables `Export to .JSON` and `Export to Excel` from the `Download` submenu when viewing a chart unless the user has `can_csv on Superset` permission. The same permission is already required for `Download to .CSV`.\r\n\r\nDisables `DOWNLOAD TO CSV` and `COPY TO CLIPBOARD` from the query results pane in SQL Lab unless the user has `can_export_csv on SQLLab` permission. The permission should be applied to both download to CSV and copy to clipboard functions since both are means of exporting data.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nVerify that a user with the `can_csv on Superset` permission (for example a user with the `Alpha` role) is able to export as CSV, JSON and Excel when viewing a chart. Verify that a user without that permission is not able to do any of those.\r\n\r\nVerify that a user with the `can_export_csv on SQLLab` pemission (for example a user with the `sql_lab` role) is able to download to CSV or copy to clipboard from the SQL Lab query results pane. Verify that a user without that permission is not able to do either of those.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses #24752\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdds the notation `!important` to the `position: relative` property of the `fullSizeStyle` CSS variable in the `ChartHolder` component. This overrides the `position: absolute` of the `dashboard-component-chart-holder` CSS class which was preventing the `ChartHolder` component from displaying full screen in certain cases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n- **Before**\r\n\r\n[before.webm](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/62552785/6a3320c7-b363-4024-acd1-83f1eace582b)\r\n\r\n- **After**\r\n\r\n[after.webm](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/62552785/c803a2fa-6a85-4753-9a1a-aff7b4f4b29c)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Go to any dashboard\r\n2. If the dashboard has the vertical filter pane closed, open it and refresh the page\r\n3. Once the dashboard page has the filter pane open on start, do a full screen on any chart\r\n4. Once the chart is in full screen, minimize the chart\r\n5. Click on the hide filter pane button\r\n6. Try again to do full screen on any chart\r\n7. The chart should be in full screen\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

generally perceived as poor form to change an existing migration, however per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f29e1e4c29a46f7d607cfa59adb8bb21d107091c/superset/migrations/versions/2019-05-06_14-30_afc69274c25a_alter_sql_column_data_type_in_query_mysql_table.py#L36-L46) the `query. executed_sql` and `query. select_sql` were previously defined as type `LONGTEXT` rather than `TEXT`, thus  https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27119 resulted in:\r\n\r\n1. Downsizing these columns to `MEDIUMTEXT` could result in data loss.\r\n2. Altering the `query` table unnecessarily can be rather expensive given the size of the table. \r\n\r\nThis PR remove mutating these columns unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested the migration using a MySQL metadata database.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

Databricks.\r\n\r\n@john-bodley I'm worried about the DB migration here and how it will affect AirBnB. Can you take a look? The migration needs to:\r\n\r\n- Read the default catalog for each of these 4 DBs and update the `catalog` column in a few models (`SqlaTable`, `Query`, `SavedQuery`, `TabState`, and `TableSchema`).\r\n- Update the `schema_perm` column for any `SqlaTable` and `Slice` models in these databases.\r\n- Rename existing permissions of type `schema_perm`.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hold back on this PR until we know it's safe to merge to `master`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nBefore running the upgrade, add a Databricks database, create a dataset, make a chart, run and save a query. They all should have no catalog information:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ndatabricks_catalogs=# SELECT catalog FROM saved_query UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM query UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM tab_state UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM table_schema UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM tables;\r\n catalog\r\n---------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5 rows)\r\n\r\ndatabricks_catalogs=# SELECT schema_perm FROM slices UNION

present:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ndatabricks_catalogs=# SELECT catalog FROM saved_query UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM query UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM tab_state UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM table_schema UNION ALL SELECT catalog FROM tables;\r\n    catalog\r\n----------------\r\n hive_metastore\r\n hive_metastore\r\n hive_metastore\r\n hive_metastore\r\n hive_metastore\r\n(5

SUMMARY\r\nThe `sqlalchemy-databricks` package ([reference](https://github.com/crflynn/sqlalchemy-databricks)) was deprecated in favor of the updated version of `databricks-sql-python` ([reference](https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-python)). This new version allows users to connect to Databricks using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatabricks://token:dapi***@***.cloud.databricks.com?http_path=/sql/***&catalog=**&schema=**\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, some more recent features are only supported with this driver. For example, if you create a table in Databricks with a `CLUSTER BY` configuration, it's not possible to create a dataset using `databricks+connector://` as it doesn't successfully handle this metadata.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new engine spec for the updated driver version, exposing a dynamic form. I believe long-term would be beneficial to deprecate the other engine specs (migrating existing connections to the new one) but for now this PR only implements support for the driver to validate with users on compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic form also includes fields for `catalog` and `schema`, so this could also help with catalog support.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNew dynamic form:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/9d850922-8012-440a-883e-d29ceae8d0dd)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Connect to Databricks using the **Databricks Python Connector** option in the database dropdown.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

is a major issue that's been plaguing the backend for a long time. Currently you can't simply run a simple `from superset import models` (or pretty much any other module import) without getting an error about the app context missing, and/or circular imports\r\n\r\nThis DRAFT PR tries to evaluate what's getting in the way. So far I've identified:\r\n\r\n- app.config being referenced in module scope, this is mostly easy to fix for common configuration, where we can rely on flask.current_app and avoid module scope\r\n- dynamic/configurable model: this seems to be the core issue, where say we let people configure their EncryptedField's type\r\n- some reliance on SecurityManager, and SecurityManager.user_model used as a relationship, I think this can be worked around using sqlalchemy's `relationship(\"use-a-string-reference\")` call\r\n- ???\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- I think we'd have to deprecate `SQLALCHEMY_ENCRYPTED_FIELD_TYPE_ADAPTER` altogether (?) unless we can find some solution\r\n- **utils** should never depend on the app, the app depends on utils\r\n\r\nTO-LOOK-INTO\r\n- Having a different way to parse the config that doesn't depend on the app context (?)","created_at":"2024-05-08T01:20:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T21:04:54Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T06:15:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5335ec2a687181326f539294db924c61e071da6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR finishes the initial work for https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862, introducing a new hierarchical data level: catalogs.\r\n\r\nA few important concepts:\r\n\r\n- Not all databases support catalogs. Notable databases that do support catalogs are Presto, Trino, Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery (\"projects\"), and Postgres (\"databases\").\r\n- SQLAlchemy has no concept of catalogs, only schemas. Because of this, DB engine specs need to implement methods that (1) return the default catalog, (2) return the list of catalog names available, and (3) modify the SQLAlchemy URI before a connection so it can point to a non-default catalog when necessary. So far only this has only been implemented in Postgres, and I'm planning to add support for Databricks next.\r\n- Support for changing the catalog needs to be enabled for each database, and defaults to false.\r\n\r\nSee the option at the bottom of \"Advanced\" -> \"Other\" -> \"Allow changing catalogs\":\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 16-57-44 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/4c04e2f9-63bc-4fd5-9aff-6025718bc4fe)\r\n\r\nOnce the feature is enabled, a dropdown will show up the in `DatabaseSelector` component, allowing users to select a catalog. This includes SQL Lab, the page for adding datasets, and the dataset editor.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 16-59-09 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/bf2817e7-1d5d-4c10-9ab2-28a93e6051bb)\r\n\r\nThe dropdown is hidden when a database without the feature is selected:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/d00de9e1-b2ac-423c-8936-6d2253ba5c95\r\n\r\nNothing should change for databases that don't support catalogs, or that have it disabled. Relevant APIs have been updated to accept an optional `catalog`. Databases without support will simply ignore it, and databases that support it will use it to establish the connection, or fallback to the default catalog if a `null` is passed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a pretty big change to Russian translation.\r\n\r\n- Extracted new strings and updated language files, as described in the [documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/contributing/howtos#extracting-new-strings-for-translation).\r\n- Normalized usage of dots at the end of sentences. The rule is simple: if given label contains only one sentence, it should not be ended with a dot. On the contrary, labels comprised of several sentences should be ended with a dot.\r\n- Normalized usage of \"е\" and \"ё\" symbols. As there was no \"ё\" pretty much everywhere and people are used to omit dots above this symbol, I have changed \"ё\" to \"е\" everywhere this symbol occurs.\r\n- Fixed typos and written language style issues.\r\n- Renamed chart to \"Диаграмма\" (previously it was called \"График\"). The reason is that \"график\" is a word that means \"line plot\". As most of visuals types are not plots, it is much more correct to call them \"диаграмма\" (diagram, chart) instead.\r\n- Normalized naming of various chart types.\r\n- Used English names for things where it is appropriate. For instance, \"Superset\" should not be translated to \"Суперсет\", as it is a proper noun.\r\n- Added quite a bunch of missing strings, corrected and confirmed some drafts.\r\n- Shortened some strings for the sake of brevity and to make them fit into tight spaces.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is still a lot of work to do, but I have managed to cover the most frequently viewed UI elements and pages. Hope the team and end users will find this version alright.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nFix percentages shown in tooltips of ECharts plugins that contain time offsets and contribution mode enabled. The ECharts version does not distinguish series and time shifts when calculating the contribution percentages as the legacy version does. Instead of showing something like series A 50%, series B 50%, series A (a year ago) 50%, series B (a year ago) 50%, it shows all series with 25%. With this fix, the contribution of time shifts are calculated independently.\r\n\r\nThis is another pre-requisite to unblock timeseries chart migrations.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\n\nI was using SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR for something specific for a customer, and had to double-check whether what's done in `config.SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR` does or doesn't affect the cache key. After checking I thought I would clarify this as a comment where it's defined.\n\nKnowing this, it could be good to allow this configuration to affect the cache key as there are use cases where you may want to mutate the SQL with say adding a specific predicate, and make sure that that predicate is captured in the cache key, but that's beyond the scope of this PR. It didn't seem trivial (nor super difficult) to add this feature, and it seemed it would require 1. changing the function signature to allow returning not only the SQL, but something to add to the cache key and 2. carrying that through the stack and onto the place where the cache key is defined.\n\nFrom my understanding SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR is often use to add metadata so around the query in the form of comments, for instance passing the username of who's running the SQL, so that its captured in the database logs. For these use cases there's really no need for altering the cache key.\n\n\n","created_at":"2024-05-06T18:31:57Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:42:39Z","closed_at":"2024-05-07T21:00:06Z","merged_at":"2024-05-07T21:00:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7ac5262570d728273f82025fe86dd4aa5b8ba08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28343 fixes an issue where I had broken a specific github action workflow in a previous PR without realizing I did. If/when altering the yaml, if the yaml itsefl is valid (we have a check for that) yet the schema is not - either through passing the right data structure or required types, the action just won't run and the PR is still mergeable. \r\n\r\nNOTE: it's really easy to break a github action (yaml is brittle, and schema enforcement for actions is loose), and it's also really easy to miss the error message about it. The failure gets somewhat buried on the Actions tab (at the bottom of https://github.com/apache/superset/actions), which is super easy to miss.\r\n\r\nOriginally I tried the pre-commit hook, but bailed on that approach as it requires installing `action-validator` in PATH, which is not super convenient as it's a Rust package. There's a node wrapper we leverage in this action, but didn't want to extend the dev deps beyond python/pip.\r\n\r\nFind out more about the hook here: https://github.com/mpalmer/action-validator\r\n\r\n### TESTING\r\n\r\nFor testing, I reverted the change from #28343, and tested the bash script fails. It did and provided a nice json blob with everything wrong with the schema provided.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\n<img width=\"802\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-06 at 11 02 18 AM\"
