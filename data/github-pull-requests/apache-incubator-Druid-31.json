Description\r\nFixes a regression caused by #14139 when filtering on non-existent paths with `JSON_VALUE`. The (one of the) added test fails without the fix.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here, I adjusted the nested column group by query test to skip group-by v1 since this stuff practically doesn't work at all except against string paths on historical segments, which feels like it is effectively unusable, so I just removed them because it was tedious to get the flag combination set correctly, and it cuts down the run time quite a bit.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

main changes:\r\n\r\n1) Provide aggregatorBuilder, a more consistent way of defining the\r\n   SqlAggFunction we need for all of our SQL aggregators. The mechanism\r\n   is analogous to the one we already use for SQL functions\r\n   (OperatorConversions.operatorBuilder).\r\n\r\n2) Allow CASTs of constants to be considered as \"literalOperands\". This\r\n   fixes an issue where various of our operators are defined with\r\n   OperandTypes.LITERAL as part of their checkers, which doesn't allow\r\n   casts. However, in these cases we generally _do_ want to allow casts.\r\n   The important piece is that the value must be reducible to a constant,\r\n   not that the SQL text is literally a literal.\r\n\r\n3) Update DataSketches SQL aggregators to use the new aggregatorBuilder\r\n   functionality. The main user-visible effect here is [2]: the aggregators\r\n   would now accept, for example, \"CAST(0.99 AS DOUBLE)\" as a literal\r\n   argument. Other aggregators could be updated in a future patch.\r\n\r\n4) Rename \"requiredOperands\" to \"requiredOperandCount\", because the\r\n   old name was confusing. (It rhymes with \"literalOperands\" but the\r\n   arguments mean different things.)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-10T18:53:11Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:31:09Z","closed_at":"2023-06-23T23:25:05Z","merged_at":"2023-06-23T23:25:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d19b748fb9fde49f074a8234e797a46bd894d48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes computation of conflicting locks when overlapping (shared) locks are present\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe computation of conflicting locks had an optimization which relied on the principle that two locks could not overlap.\r\nThis is incorrect when shared locks are used, and this PR aims to correct it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThe fix is to simply remove the optimization as there is no easy way to find overlapping intervals without iterating the set of all intervals, when overlapping is possible.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TaskLockbox`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14213 by ensuring we do not convert to IN filters if there are > 1 conditions. We create selector filters, and them and finally or those and filters\r\n\r\nPreviously what we did was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT t1.__time, t1.m1\r\nFROM foo t1\r\nJOIN (SELECT m1, MAX(__time) as latest_time FROM foo WHERE m1 IN (1,2) GROUP BY m1) t2\r\nON t1.m1 = t2.m1 AND t1.__time = t2.latest_time\r\n```\r\nFilters for the inner query would appear as `(m1 IN (1.0, 2.0) && __time IN (946684800000, 946771200000))` which was incorrect. After this change, the join-to-filter conversion/ optimization is done only when the number of equijoins is equal to 1. This will ensure correctness. Cases with >1 equijoins will be tackled separately as an optimization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis function adds a new `ARRAY_TO_MV` function which provides the opposite behavior of `MV_TO_ARRAY` to allow coercing any type of `ARRAY` into a plain `VARCHAR`. The intention of this function is to assist in the process of migrating tables that currently use native multi-value `STRING` columns to `ARRAY<STRING>`. \r\n\r\n`ARRAY_TO_MV` allows cluster operators to begin ingesting true native `ARRAY` type columns, but can use this function to wrap these array types to use as a crutch to make them exhibit classic multi-value dimension (implicit unnest when grouping, etc) so that applications using Druid can continue with their current behavior. As the apps are updated to properly begin querying these columns with `ARRAY` semantics, existing MVD columns can instead be switched to use `MV_TO_ARRAY`, which has been modified to now accept `ARRAY` types to pass through as `ARRAY<STRING>`. Note that I didn't change the `MV_TO_ARRAY` of casting to `ARRAY<STRING>`, so only MVDs and the `ARRAY<STRING>` type they have become should be wrapped with this function. Other types of `ARRAY` when used with `MV_TO_ARRAY` will be coerced to `ARRAY<STRING>`, which likely isn't desirable behavior.\r\n\r\nRight now `ARRAY_TO_MV` exists purely as an expression virtual column, as a follow-up I will be adding a dedicated virtual column for both `ARRAY_TO_MV` and `MV_TO_ARRAY` so that coercing in either direction can be nearly as performant as the native column usage, including supporting indexes for fast filtering. Making migration not come with a penalty which is very important longer term.\r\n\r\nDeferring release notes specifically for this in favor of this being part of a larger section on mvd -> array migration in 27 release.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-09T20:21:45Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:35:41Z","closed_at":"2023-05-11T11:43:28Z","merged_at":"2023-05-11T11:43:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"a58cebe4917dadc65ecd3143668288229a57d22a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

patch starts the process of decoupling logical planning and native query generation in SQL planning. Currently, the DAG optimization and the native query generation are both done simultaneously in the planner via calcite optimization and conversion rules.\r\nThat coupling leads to difficulty in obtaining a logical DAG from the planner if needed, as well as the debugging and logging for erroneous queries also becomes very difficult to do or comprehend.\r\nThe patch decouples the two things by allowing logical planning to happen via the calcite planner and let it generate a DAG which contains `RelNode` nodes as per a defined logical Druid convention. Post that, the DAG is converted to a native query through a visitor over the produced `RelNode` tree.\r\nThe patch is put behind a feature flag `plannerStrategy` which can have two modes `COUPLED` and `DECOUPLED`. Currently, the default mode is `COUPLED` which means that the mode of planning currently is same as before. \r\nThe new planning mode is enabled via setting the mode as `DECOUPLED`.\r\nFurther, the feature is WIP in the sense that some operators (like join/window/union) haven't been rewritten to allow planning through the new mechanism. Also, in the currently converted operators (scan/filter/project/sort/aggregate), there are a few test failures in the corner cases. Both of those things are planned to be fixed in future patches for the feature.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-09T06:26:44Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:31:44Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T23:00:40Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T23:00:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"09d6c5a45ed9c737e711403a864903dcbbf22830","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Changes\r\n\r\n- `CostBalancerStrategyTest`\r\n  - Focus on verification of cost computations rather than choosing servers in this test\r\n  - Add new tests `testComputeCost` and `testJointSegmentsCost`\r\n  - Add tests to demonstrate that with a long enough interval gap, all costs become negligible\r\n  - Retain `testIntervalCost` and `testIntervalCostAdditivity`\r\n  - Remove redundant tests such as `testStrategyMultiThreaded`, `testStrategySingleThreaded`as verification of this behaviour is better suited to `BalancingStrategiesTest`.\r\n- `CostBalancerStrategyBenchmark`\r\n  - Remove usage of static method from `CostBalancerStrategyTest`\r\n  - Explicitly setup cluster and segments to use for benchmarking\r\n\r\n### Excluded\r\nTests that verify the server chosen for a given operation, such as load, drop or move are better suited to `BalancingStrategiesTest`, as we would want to verify that behaviour for all existing strategies. Some of these tests already exist and more can be added later.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

of the PodTemplateTaskAdapter unit tests fail in Java 17 due to differences in the underlying gzip compression implementation.\r\n\r\nIn our case, it produces a -1 instead of a 0 in the output stream which is translated into a difference in the task annotation.\r\nI took a look at the underlying Deflater configuration between Java 11 and Java 17 thinking that might be the difference between the outputs but the configurations looked the same to me.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at this for a while I couldn't find any reason for the difference in gzip'd values other than different lower level implementations in java 11 and 17 so I decided to just update the unit test to make sure that the decompressed task annotation matches what we expect.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFix a unit test that fails in java 17\r\n\r\nI looked into alternate solutions like setting the config for the deflater in the gzip stream class but none of that seemed to work.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix Unit

Description\r\n\r\nThis change makes it so that extension writers can now optionally bind extra service dimensions. This is useful if an extension wants to bind service dimensions that are only relevant to one node type, but not the others. This will allow the extension to be listed in the extension load list in the common runtime properties without needing to inject invalid properties for all the other services where the dimensions are not relevant.\r\n\r\nDeveloper facing docs are added to the `ExtraServiceDimensions` class.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNEW: Extension developers can optionally bind extra service dimensions to be emitted by the service emitter.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

when cancelling an MSQ task, the stopGracefully method isn't blocking. It just adds the request to the kernel queue. The lifecycle close thread continues to shutdown other lifecycle objects. This leads to a bug where other classes like DiscoveryServiceLocator is closed before the controller has time to send cancel requests to all the workers (noticeable more when using MM than indexer, though the issue is present in both).\r\n\r\nstopGracefully should be a blocking call so that this does not occur.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

documentation about `multiValueHandling`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm a druid beginner, so I'm not super sure, but `multiValueHandling` param has only effects on `string` type dimension.\r\nI read source codes and PRs below, and it seems the `multiValueHandling` sorts only string value.\r\nSo I update the doc to add the information about it.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2541\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10695\r\n\r\nI tried to create supervisor with `long` data with `multiValueHandling` as `ARRAY`, but druid always override `multiValueHandling` as `SORTED_ARRAY`.\r\nI though it is weird and I read the doc, but doc seems that we can set the value for all types.\r\nI spent long time for this survey, so I want to clarify it in the documents.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `docs`\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when using 'auto' encoded `LONG` typed columns and the 'vectorized' query engine. These columns use a delta based bit-packing mechanism, and errors in the vectorized reader would cause it to incorrectly read column values for some bit sizes (1 through 32 bits). This is a regression caused by #11004, which added the optimized readers to improve performance, so impacts Druid versions 0.22.0+.\r\n\r\nWhile writing the test I finally got sad enough about `IndexSpec` not having a \"builder\", so I made one, and switched all the things to use it. Apologies for the noise in this bug fix PR, the only real changes are in `VSizeLongSerde`, and the tests that have been modified to cover the buggy behavior, `VSizeLongSerdeTest` and `ExpressionVectorSelectorsTest`. Everything else is just cleanup of `IndexSpec` usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n'auto' encoded `LONG` typed columns can read values incorrectly when using the vectorized query engine. The data itself in the segment is fine, it is just translated incorrectly for the vectorize query engine. If using 'auto' encoded `LONG` columns in versions 0.22.0 through 25.0.0, we recommended to disable vectorization until upgrading to a Druid version 26.0.0.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `VSizeLongSerde`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that could occur if `druid.query.scheduler.numThreads` is configured and any exception occurs after `QueryScheduler.run` has been called to create a `Sequence`. This would result in total and/or lane specific locks being acquired, but because the sequence was not actually being evaluated, the \"baggage\" which typically releases these locks was not being executed. An example of how this can happen is if a group-by having filter, which wraps and transforms this sequence happens to explode while wrapping the sequence. The end result is that the locks are acquired, but never released, eventually halting the ability to execute any queries.\r\n\r\nI've modified `QueryScheduler.run` to now use `Sequence.wrap` with a full `SequenceWrapper` implementation that acquire the locks in the `before` and releases them in the `after` to better ensure that we always release what we take, no matter what. I'm not really sure why I wasn't doing it like this before...\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13894, https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14041.\r\n\r\nIn `StreamChunkParser#parseWithInputFormat`, we call `byteEntityReader.read()` without handling a potential `ParseException`, which is thrown during this function call by the delegate `AvroStreamReader#intermediateRowIterator`. \r\nA `ParseException` can be thrown if an Avro stream has corrupt data or data that doesn't conform to the schema specified or for other decoding reasons. This exception if uncaught, can cause ingestion to fail. \r\n\r\nPrimary code changes:\r\n- Handle `ParseException` in the call stack `StreamChunkParser`.\r\n- Improved the error message when the avro schema id cannot be found. \r\n-  Added a new constructor to `StreamChunkParser` to facilitate unit testing. This allows dependencies to be passed in by the caller, making testing easier.\r\n- Fix miscellaneous typos and javadocs in the modified code.\r\n\r\nUnit test changes:\r\n- Add unit tests in `StreamChunkParserTest` and `KafkaIndexTaskTest` to test this exception handling behavior alongside setting maximum allowed parse exceptions to different thresholds.\r\n- Replace `NoopRowIngestionMeters` and a mocked `RowIngestionMeters` with a more realistic implementation, `SimpleRowIngestionMeters`, used to validate any parse exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13894, https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14041.\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

are some build failures (https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/4815370013/jobs/8580557362?pr=14175) due to HttpServerInventoryViewTest.testSyncMonitoring. This PR will hopefully fix those flakey test issues.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nThe test fails occasionally because the test calls serverAdded on three servers and then immediately calls syncMonitoring, assuming that the three recently added servers will be newly synced and the logic in syncMonitoring will skip them.\r\n\r\nCalling serverAdded on a server will create a DruidServerHolder for the server and then call start() on the underlying ChangeRequestHttpSyncer object. The start() call will schedule a execution of the sync() method but not guarantee execution before the serverAdded returns. Because of this the unit test can sometimes call syncMonitoring before sync() has been called on all of the ChangeRequestHttpSyncer objects.\r\n\r\nThis causes serverHolder.syncer.isOK() to return false and eventually leads to the emit call that is failing in the tests.\r\n\r\n**Release notes**\r\nFix to flaky unit test\r\n\r\n**Key changed/added classes in this PR**\r\nRegister a noop emitter so the emit call doesn't fail\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-27T21:26:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-01T22:06:34Z","closed_at":"2023-04-28T01:32:51Z","merged_at":"2023-04-28T01:32:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0654e217480b5e28e793bf1dbd609cae9e5bac9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1048471070,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ4NDcxMDcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Flaky%20test","name":"Flaky

are some build failures (https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/4815370013/jobs/8580557362?pr=14175) due to HttpServerInventoryViewTest.testSyncMonitoring. This PR will hopefully fix those flakey test issues.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI think the test fails occasionally because the test calls serverAdded on three servers and then immediately calls syncMonitoring, assuming that the three recently added servers will be newly synced and the logic in syncMonitoring will skip them.\r\n\r\nCalling serverAdded on a server will create a DruidServerHolder for the server and then call start() on the underlying ChangeRequestHttpSyncer object. The start() call will schedule a execution of the sync() method but not guarantee execution before the serverAdded returns. Because of this the unit test can sometimes call syncMonitoring before sync() has been called on all of the ChangeRequestHttpSyncer objects.\r\n\r\nThis causes serverHolder.syncer.isOK() to return false and eventually leads to the emit call that is failing in the tests.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix to flaky unit test\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nBefore calling syncMonitoring, make sure each of the server holders in HttpServerInventory has actually ran sync().\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

This binding overrode the existing binding from TaskLogStreamer to SwitchingTaskLogStreamer in CliOverlord.  The effect bing that calls to get task reports or logs in the overlord api would go directly to check task storage instead of checking the task runner first.  Since the binding from TaskLogStreamer to TaskLogs is not needed, we remove it here.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nAdds new MSQ query context parameter `useAutoColumnSchemas` as a sort of hacky backdoor to allow using the latest and greatest features added in #14014 and related PRs (#13803, etc). When set, all columns except for custom `COMPLEX` column types will use the native 'auto' column indexer added in #14014 when generating segments. I call this a bit hacky because MSQ doesn't officially support the true array types besides `ARRAY<STRING>`, which is translated into `STRING` unless the new context flag is set, but other array types can be still be ingested by specifying `COMPLEX<json>` as the input schema to use the complex passthrough.\r\n\r\nI did not document this at this time on purpose, this is mainly for allowing experimentation with the newer column features and MSQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a

original intent of the `TaskStartTimeoutFault` was to throw an error if the MSQ job is stuck waiting for tasks. The current approach of a fixed 10 minute timeout does not make sense if you are autoscaling. \r\nAdjusted the logic to change the timeout start time to the last successfully launched worker time. This ensure that there is progress in the job since tasks are launching. \r\n\r\nFor eg: \r\n\r\nif the job start time is `01 hr 00 min` and the number of tasks is 100, then if by `01 hr 10 min` all tasks are not launched, the job will fail with `TaskStartTimeout` . With this patch, if the last task is launched at `01 hr 08 mins`, the job will timeout at 01 hr 18 mins . The counter is reset every-time a new task is launched.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-26T16:31:37Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:36:27Z","closed_at":"2023-05-02T18:35:15Z","merged_at":"2023-05-02T18:35:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"6f0cdd0c3ff3ece039150f49df70dd4a49454495","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

a worker dies after it has finished generating results, MSQ decides to not retry it as it has no active work orders. However, since we don't keep track of it further, if it is required for a future stage, the controller hangs waiting for the worker to be ready. This PR keeps tracks of any workers the controller decides to not restart immediately and while starting workers for the next stage, queues these workers for retry.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes unneeded creation of a NoopSupervisorSpec as a tombstone\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nWhen using the avro extension druid does not ingest dimensions that have been flattened  using the below jsonpath expression\r\n\r\n```\r\nsomeRecordArray[?(@.nestedString=='string in record')].nestedString\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the above expression is to capture all elements within a record array which have their `nestedString` field set to 'string in record'. This was not working in druid because the jayway jsonpath library was throwing an exception with the message `com.jayway.jsonpath.JsonPathException: Could not convert string in record to a ValueNode`. Exceptions are suppressed for this library so end users would not see this error appear in the logs (I believe). \r\n\r\nThe exception would have been thrown here https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath/blob/master/json-path/src/main/java/com/jayway/jsonpath/internal/filter/ValueNodes.java#L705 This is because the `res` is of type `org.apache.avro.util.Utf8`. The idea with my fix is to return a type which the jayway json path can understand.\r\n\r\nI think this would allow end users to create more complex jsonpath expressions \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

is a Catch-22 issue with the retention dialog:\r\n\r\n- It uses the `GET /druid/coordinator/v1/tiers` API to get the list of available tiers and does not let you type in your own tier\r\n- That API only reports on tiers that have data assigned to them\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this by:\r\n\r\n1. Using a different API to fetch tiers (same as the Services view)\r\n2. Giving users a JSON fallback for the RetentionDialog\r\n3. There is also some code cleanup, tier fetching is now done by the dialog and not by the datasources view\r\n\r\nThis PR does not let users assign data for tires that do not yet have historicals via

Update AggregatorUtil.canVectorize to allow vectorization on any\r\n   fieldName-based aggregation.\r\n\r\n2) Update AggregatorUtil.makeVectorValueSelector to return zeroes and\r\n   nulls for strings and complex types, so aggregations can vectorize\r\n   on top of them. This behavior is consistent with the default\r\n   implementation in DimensionSelector for strings, where the primitive\r\n   getX methods always return zero. It is _not_ consistent with the\r\n   behavior of NestedFieldDictionaryEncodedColumn.StringDimensionSelector,\r\n   although I don't see a good way to reconcile that, so I decided to go\r\n   with the behavior of most other DimensionSelector.\r\n\r\n3) Switch longLast, floatLast, doubleLast to use AggregatorUtil.makeVectorValueSelector\r\n   so they can run on strings and complex types.\r\n\r\nEffects:\r\n\r\n- Simple numeric aggregators (sum, min, max) can vectorize when run on string or complex columns.\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug where longLast, floatLast, doubleLast would throw an error like the following when run on a string column in vectorized mode. Now, they'll return zero, as they do in nonvectorized mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot make VectorValueSelector for column with

Description\r\nThis PR fixes some bugs in both SQL compatible and 'default' value modes when filtering `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` on values which are coerced to a numeric type, such as `CAST(x AS BIGINT)` or `JSON_VALUE(nested, '$.x' RETURNING BIGINT)`. While these expressions had different causes, the underlying effect was more or less the same and involved the query engine using the null value index for the underlying column to build the cursor, which only counts the null string values, and misses out on values which might become null after coercion.\r\n\r\nFor example given the following source data:\r\n<img width=\"516\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 4 43 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/233599768-1944500d-efe5-42e4-898f-8e3e18f31b92.png\">\r\n\r\ntrying to filter out nulls in default value mode would produce the following results:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"625\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 4 43 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/233599907-fba40829-49db-41be-8fa6-04a78b49f17f.png\">\r\n\r\nand the same data ingested in SQL compatible mode also incorrect:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"823\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 4 48 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/233600103-89404513-b388-4a2f-8649-8cb5478a847b.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever the \"correct\" results in \"default\" value mode should match all of the rows because there are no null numbers, and in SQL compatible mode, should only match a single row, since that is the only truly non-null number.\r\n\r\n`JSON_VALUE` suffered from the same problem when using the `RETURNING` syntax to cast to a numeric type for string or mixed type fields.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we avoid using the indexes when this is the case. It would be possible to partially use these indexes and a value matcher for the 'is not null' case, but currently not null is handled as a single index, rather a not filter on a selector filter, so its a little bit tricky to implement right now so I'll save this for a future change.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes issues with 'auto' typed numeric columns to ensure they behave consistently with classic numeric columns in 'default' value mode, which means picking up the 'null values dont exist' behavior that much of the query engine has. In default value mode, the numeric index suppliers will combine the null and 0 indexes when searching for 0 to ensure that indexes behave consistently with the value matchers. I have added the 'auto' typed columns to `BaseFilterTest` to better cover the 'auto' indexers, only skipping tests related to implicit multi-value handling.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixed issues involving filtering `NULL` values when using `CAST` expressions and `JSON_VALUE` expressions using the `RETURNING` syntax to coerce non-numeric types into numeric types, such as `CAST(x AS BIGINT) IS NOT NULL` or `JSON_VALUE(nested, '$.x' RETURNING BIGINT) IS NULL`. These expressions were incorrectly using the null value index of the underlying column, which produced results matching the values which were `NULL` string values, but not values which could not be converted into a numeric value and so were effectively `NULL`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR aims to add support for ingesting logs from a rabbitmq [superstream](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/07/rabbitmq-3-11-feature-preview-super-streams), as a peer to Kafka or Kinesis. Since this supports scalable exactly once delivery, this provides a good gasket between RabbitMQ and Druid.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is a WIP for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1) No support for username/password and some other features, I welcome suggestions here as I'm not exactly sure how those work yet and could use some guidance on how that plumbing works\r\n\r\n2) The algorithm is pretty poor here, simply making a new rabbit consumer for each poll, it should be doing something similar to Kinesis where it fetches in the background, occasionally backing off if it gets too far ahead.\r\n\r\n3) Testing is extremely bare bones, primarily because the design of the record supplier could change here, and design layout could change test layout here.\r\n\r\n4) Documentation on how exactly to use it is missing. I've been testing it with the below supervisor spec, the primary configuration mechanism is the 'uri' which is used to configure how it connects to rabbitmq for reading metadata and for getting messages\r\n\r\nThe meat of the change is in RabbitStreamRecordSupplier, which has the components that interface with rabbitmq.\r\n It uses two interfaces, one being the low level 'Client' interface to read the partitions from a super stream so that druid can distribute work, and the other being the 'Consumer' interface, the conventional interface which creates a thread that listens for messages for you, and calls back on the handler which puts the messages in queue.\r\n \r\nThe current interface simply manages a map of ConsumerBuilders as partitions are assigned, and then when it is polled for messages it will create consumers and wait for the timeout. Once the timeout has elapsed, it will close all the consumers, then collect any messages from the queue and return them. This should ensure no messages are lost, but probably isn't very efficient as it could be reconnecting more than necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNew: You can now ingest logs from RabbitMQ via super streams\r\n\r\nThis feature gives the ability to read directly from rabbitmq using the new super-streams feature. As super streams allows exactly-once delivery with full support for partitioning, it is now compatible with Druid's modern ingestion algorithm, without the downsides that the prior RabbitMQ firehose.\r\n\r\nNote that this uses the RabbitMQ streams feature, and not a conventional exchange. You will need to make sure that your messages are in a super stream before consumption. For more information, see https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html.\r\n\r\nIn order to configure, create a new index task using the 'rabbit' type, and configure it's stream and URI to connect to the rabbitmq host.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"rabbit\",\r\n  \"dataSchema\": {\r\n    \"dataSource\": <your super-stream>,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"ioConfig\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"rabbit\",\r\n    \"stream\": \"api-audit\",\r\n    \"uri\": \"rabbitmq-stream://localhost:5552\",\r\n    \"taskCount\": 1,\r\n    \"replicas\": 1,\r\n    \"taskDuration\": \"PT1H\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"rabbit\",\r\n    \"resetOffsetAutomatically\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nThe following classes have been added to druid in this PR:\r\n * `RabbitStreamSamplerSpec`\r\n * `RabbitStreamRecordSupplier`\r\n * `RabbitStreamIndexTaskTuningConfig`\r\n * `RabbitStreamIndexTaskModule`\r\n * `RabbitStreamIndexTaskIOConfig`\r\n * `RabbitStreamIndexTaskClientFactory`\r\n * `RabbitStreamIndexTask`\r\n * `RabbitStreamDataSourceMetadata`\r\n * `IncrementalPublishingRabbitStreamIndexTaskRunner`\r\n * `RabbitSupervisorTuningConfig`\r\n * `RabbitStreamSupervisorSpec`\r\n * `RabbitStreamSupervisorReportPayload`\r\n * `RabbitStreamSupervisorIOConfig`\r\n * `RabbitStreamSupervisorIngestionSpec`\r\n * `RabbitStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes typo in s3 docs.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `extensions-core/s3-extensions/README.md`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
