Add Micrometer-based metrics system\r\n\r\n- Add MetricsSession interface that represents the lifecycle of a meter\r\n  registry, and allows connecting \"downstream\" registries.\r\n- Add MetricsPublishingService interface that defines a service that\r\n  can be implemented to interact with MetricsSessions by connecting\r\n  \"downstream\" registries to publish metrics to external monitoring\r\n  systems.\r\n- Add CompositeMeterRegistryFactory whichs handles creating the\r\n  composite meter registry for the cache and defining its common tags.\r\n- Add CacheLifecycleMetricsSession class that loads implementations of\r\n  MetricsPublishingService and manages the cache meter registry based\r\n  on the cache lifecycle.\r\n- InternalCacheBuilder uses CompositeMeterRegistryFactory to create the\r\n  cache meter registry and starts a CacheLifecycleMetricsSession. The\r\n  cache meter registry is passed to GemFireCacheImpl and exposed to\r\n  internal Geode code by InternalCache.getMeterRegistry().\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Dale Emery

dependency to explicit list in TomcatInstall.java\r\n  in geode-assembly/geode-assembly-test.\r\n\r\nGEODE-6295: Add Micrometer-based metrics system\r\n\r\n- Added MetricsSession interface that represents the lifecycle of a\r\n  meter registry, and allows connecting \"downstream\" registries.\r\n- Added MemberMetricsSession class that creates and configures the meter\r\n  registry for a particular member, and manages connections to the meter\r\n  registry.\r\n- Added methods to InternalDistributedSystem to retrieve both the meter\r\n  registry and the metrics session.\r\n- Added ConnectionConfig interface that extends DistributionConfig, and\r\n  ConnectionConfigImpl that extends DistributionConfigImpl. See below for\r\n  details and rationale.\r\n\r\nConstructing a MemberMetricsSession requires a member name and a\r\ndistributed system ID. These values were previously available only via a\r\nDistributionConfigImpl constructed by InternalDistributedSystem, based\r\non properties passed to the InternalDistributedSystem constructor,\r\nsupplemented by default values supplied by DistributionConfigImpl. This\r\nmade it impossible to inject an already-constructed MemberMetricsSession\r\ninto InternalDistributedSystem.\r\n\r\nConstructing a DistributionConfigImpl outside of the\r\nInternalDistributedSystem constructor was complicated by several\r\nfactors:\r\n- DistributionConfigImpl throws an exception if passed a property that\r\n  it does not recognize.\r\n- Some calls to InternalDistributedSystem.newInstance() pass special\r\n  properties intended for use only in the InternalDistributedSystem\r\n  constructor. DistributionConfigImpl does not recognize these special\r\n  properties.\r\n- The responsibility for extracting and retaining those properties was\r\n  implemented in the InternalDistributedSystem constructor.\r\n\r\nWe moved the responsibility to extract those special properties from\r\nInternalDistributionConfig to the new ConnectionConfigImpl class.\r\nConnectionConfigImpl extracts and retains the properties before passing\r\nthe properties to its DistributionConfigImpl superclass. The resulting\r\nConnectionConfigImpl object is a valid DistributionConfigImpl, and also\r\nsupplies the special properties needed by the InternalDistributedSystem\r\nconstructor.\r\n\r\nGiven these changes, we now:\r\n- Construct a ConnectionConfigImpl outside of the\r\n  InternalDistributedSystem constructor\r\n- Use the ConnectionConfig to create the MemberMetricsSession\r\n- Inject both the ConnectionConfigImpl and the MemberMetricsSession into\r\n  the InternalDistributedSystem constructor.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-Authored-By: Michael Oleske <moleske@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-Authored-By: Mark Hanson <mhanson@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-Authored-By: Kirk Lund <klund@apache.org>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

previous commit for GEODE-6442 was correct but incomplete. There are still instances of statistics shown in VSD that should display the pid in the pid column but instead show either nothing (zero) or a membership port.\r\n\r\nThe commit for GEODE-6269: Extract StatisticsRegistry from IDS (#3068) removed the correct defaults of textId and numericId. When textId is empty, the textId should default to the member name (StatisticsManager.getName). When numericId is zero, the numericId should default to the pid (StatisticsManager.getPid).\r\n\r\nNote that I've restored the correct defaults in the base class StatisticsImpl instead of duplicating it in both LocalStatisticsImpl and StripedStatisticsImpl. New tests confirm the defaults and will prevent accidental changes in the future.\r\n\r\nI fixed up StatisticsImpl and StatisticsImplTest before fixing GEODE-6442. The mutable static logger was a mess and I believe the boolean `closed` field should be volatile.\r\n```\r\ncommit b93f3904d70c85f2c8d3a93529437a6899179793\r\nAuthor: Kirk Lund

removes TypedJson and replaces it with QueryResultFormatter that uses Jackson ObjectMapper to serialize query results into a JSON document.   Custom serializers for collections, PdxInstance, query Structs, etc. do most of the work.  It also wraps the default serializer in order to keep Jackson from going crazy if there is a circular reference and to limit the depth of serialization (GEODE-1842, which was never really fixed).\r\n\r\nMost of the changes in this PR are replacing the TypedJson class name with QueryResultFormatter and changing the expected query result strings.  The bulk of the code to be reviewed is in the new QueryResultFormatter class.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

code that scrubbed the current membership view of IDs matching a\r\nnew join request.  This code is no longer needed now that we generate a\r\nnew UUID for a member when it tries to auto-reconnect.  The new ID of\r\nsuch a member would never match an old ID.\r\n\r\nIn practice this code was causing test failures in situations where the\r\nauto-reconnect time was set to a small value.  A member would end up\r\nsending multiple join requests to the same coordinator.

causes of using too much memory have been identified:\r\n\r\n1.

found a place where we were releasing pooled buffers twice.  The place\r\nto release the buffer is in asyncClose but we were also doing it just\r\nafter calling that method in the run() method if the connection wasn't\r\nthread-owned.  Both GEODE-6389 and GEODE-6377 were using\r\nconserve-sockets=true so I think this is the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe GEODE-6389 failure, in particular, could only have come from\r\nimproper use of the buffer pool because it occured in a MessageStreamer\r\nand they don't involve multithreaded use of a buffer.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
