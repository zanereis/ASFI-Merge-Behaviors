Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10188) Adds the `jaxws-api` dependency to `nifi-email-processors` to avoid `NoClassDefFoundError` failures for `javax.xml.ws.http.HTTPException` with the `ConsumeEWS` Processor on Java 11 and Java 17.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft `ews-java-api` is no longer maintained and is targeted to Java 8, which includes the `HTTPException` class as part of the standard distribution. Adding the `jaxws-api` dependency allows the new unit test to run without throwing a `NoClassDefFoundError` on Java 11 and 17.\r\n\r\nThe `ConsumeEWS` Processor should be deprecated in subsequent releases, but this change provides the possibility for successful invocation on Java 11.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Specifically, the C2 modules fails to pass unit test when the user's groupid value is large (>2097151). This PR addresses the issue by enabling \"bigNumberMode\" in org.apache.commons:commons-compress library where otherwise errors would occur.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10852](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10852)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\nTo verify, a build which consistently failed (due to groupid value being too large) was able to complete successfully.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10849) Changes the GitHub ci-workflow to run Maven `test-compile` instead of `compile` for the Maven Compile step.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10819) Restricts the custom Kafka client property `sasl.jaas.config` to block usage of the `JndiLoginModule` by marking the Processor as invalid. The `JndiLoginModule` is not used for supported, but this approach prevents unexpected and insecure configuration settings.\r\n\r\nThe implementation applies to Kafka 2.6 components and replaces the `KafkaProcessorUtils` class with discrete interfaces and implementations in a new `nifi-kafka-shared` module. The components in `nifi-kafka-shared` do not have any dependencies on Kafka client libraries. The implementation approach will allow the same refactoring to Kafka 1.0 and 2.0 components, but this pull request limits the scope of Kafka 2.6 to reduce the initial impact of refactoring.\r\n\r\n#

I dived deep to the class \"TestXMLReaderProcessor\" where the record has been transfer to String and stored in records.\r\nAfter several printouts and checking log files and view the code in Record interface, we found that we can actually get the value and field of each record. \r\n\r\nThe reason assertion can't pass is that the record is implemented as hashmap. When record.toString(), the order of the data is non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nSince the record.toString() return a string variable, I did not really want to change too many codes. And the onTrigger function only put the string variable to records List. So I create a String variable to make the record in a specific format. As I said before, we can get value of the record by given function record.getValue(\"field\")\r\n```\r\nString str=\"MapRecord[{COUNTRY=\"+record.getValue(\"COUNTRY\").toString()+\", ATTR_ID=\"+record.getValue(\"ATTR_ID\").toString()+\", NAME=\"+record.getValue(\"NAME\").toString()+\", AGE=\"+record.getValue(\"AGE\").toString()+\"}]\";\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy changing this, the compile can pass and the bug has been fixed. It is not flaky anymore and can pass the NonDex's check.\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Please verify these docker hub as you normally might use them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10835](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10835) Improves the performance of `TestControlRate`, reducing the overall runtime from over 12 seconds to less than one second.\r\n\r\nThe implementation updates `ControlRate` and `TimedBuffer` classes to use a `LongSupplier` that can be overridden to increment the current time in test methods. This approaches preserves current behavior of `ControlRate` and supports a `ConfigurableControlRate` extension in the test class, avoiding the need for `Thread.sleep()`.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10826) Separates Maven compilation and verification into separate build steps within the GitHub ci-workflow configuration.\r\n\r\nThe updated ci-workflow includes a Maven Compile step that calls `mvn compile` with two threads per core and excludes several assembly that are not necessary for initial compilation. The subsequent Maven Verify step calls `mvn verify` with existing arguments to run standard unit tests.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjusting the lifecycle phase for `nifi-h2-database` to be invoked during compilation, and shifting NiFi Registry documentation unpacking to the `prepare-package` phase where it is needed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Unfortunately, the new signature `defaultValue(null)`  doesn’t work. Only if you cast it. Because of that, I’ve removed the redundant null defaultValue assignments. However, at this point, I’m unsure what brings more value, and I cannot decide it at the moment. Sometimes it is useful to indicate that the default value is null. On the other hand, reducing redundancy and getting rid of unnecessary getValues() contribute to clean code. A workaround could be to add `defaultNull()` to the Builder() that can be used instead of `defaultValue(null)`. That could be useful in the case of `sensitive(boolean)` too.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n-

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10780](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10780) Improves `ListenSyslog` and `ListenTCP` handling of queued messages when reaching the maximum configured queue size. Changes to the supporting `ByteArrayMessageChannelHandler` allow the handler to retry queuing messages as long as the Processor is running.\r\n\r\nThe changes update `ByteArrayMessageChannelHandler` to call `BlockingQueue.offer()` with a 500 ms timeout, instead of `BlockingQueue.add()`, which throws an `IllegalStateException` when attempt to add to a full queue. The handler loop checks the shutting down status of the managing `EventExecutor` to stop trying and throw an exception when the framework instructs the Processor to shutdown the listening event server.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjusting the `NettyEventServer` to call `ChannelFuture.await()` instead of `ChannelFuture.syncUninterruptibly()` for the `Channel.close()` operation. This is necessary so that the `shutdown()` method proceeds to call `shutdownGracefully()`, which informs handlers that the executor is shutting down.\r\n\r\nQueue failures can occur when the Processor is being stopped, the queue is full, and the listening event server is attempting to add a message to the queue. This scenario will result in throwing a new `EventDroppedException`, logged at the warning level.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Instead of comparing the string of the attribute and the expected one, I used `jsonassert` to compare the two JSON objects. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10768](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10768) Updates the `ListenSyslog` Processor to discard incoming messages consisting of zero bytes.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can occur when the `Parse Messages` property is disabled. Changes include a new test method to send a batch of messages with an empty message to confirm expected behavior. The implementation adds a `FilteringStrategy` argument to the generic Server Factory to support the potential for other components to implement similar behavior.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10755](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10755) Refactors components in the following modules to use new `StandardSslContextBuilder` and `StandardKeyStoreBuilder` classes from `nifi-security-ssl` for creating instances of `javax.net.ssl.SSLContext`:\r\n\r\n- c2-client-http\r\n- minifi-bootstrap\r\n- nifi-site-to-site-client\r\n- nifi-registry-client\r\n- nifi-registry-framework\r\n- nifi-toolkit-admin\r\n- nifi-toolkit-cli\r\n\r\nThe refactored approach reduces duplicate code related to instantiation of Key and Trust Managers, providing a standard solution without introducing additional transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe refactored approach allowed for the removal of `SslContextFactory` and `CertificateUtils` classes from `nifi-registry`.\r\n\r\nImplementation updates include introducing a new `StandardTrustManagerBuilder` to support instantiation of an `X509TrustManager`. Additional changes include removing incorrect usage of client authentication policy in Registry LDAP components, and setting a more generalized default TLS protocol for NiFi and Registry CLI clients.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10506](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10506) Moves the `Repository Encryption` configuration section from the User Guide to the Administrator's Guide and adds a new section named `Configuration Change Considerations`. The new section highlights the fact that disabling repository encryption requires removing the contents of existing repositories.\r\n\r\nThe Repository Encryption configuration details are administration concerns, as opposed to user concerns, so this move aligns with the Repository Encryption properties already present in the Administrator's Guide.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

To test, add multiple processors and ports to the canvas. Configure one of the processors to run on the primary node. Open the summary modal. You'll notice two new filters; a dropdown to filter by status and a checkbox to filter by processors configured to run on the primary node. \r\n![NIFI-10698](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/199306406-8760e636-0baa-4783-87ee-cb3574e9c901.gif)\r\n\r\nThe status filter is also available for input and output ports while the primary node filter is only available for processors. Navigating between tabs resets the filters to their initial state.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10737](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10737) Corrects the behavior of the `ListenBeats` Processor when reading a socket buffer where the buffer size is greater than 2048 bytes.\r\n\r\nThe Netty framework can invoke handlers with a `ByteBuf` containing any number of bytes, so the handler implementations must be capable of checking for available bytes and resuming operation on subsequent invocations.\r\n\r\nChanges include adding a new unit test for `ListenBeats`, removing unnecessary dependencies from `nifi-beats-processors`, and implementing a new `BatchDecoder` class for reading Beats Protocol frames. The protocol implementation follows the general approach of the [logstash-input-beats](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats) project for reading Beats Version 2 frames.\r\n\r\nThe channel handler process is also more efficient as it sends a Message Acknowledgement  packet for the last Sequence Number from the batch of messages, as opposed to sending one for every message received.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi
