described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7792, Trogdor should have a simple uptime function.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis PR adds two new endpoints, one for the Trogdor Agent and one for the Trogdor Coordinator.\r\n`GET /agent/uptime`\r\n`GET /coordinator/uptime`\r\n\r\nBoth return a 200 status code and a JSON response informing the user how long the agent/coordinator has been running for:\r\n```\r\n{\"serverStartMs\": 1, \"nowMs\": 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the `/coordinator/uptime` is a bit superfluous, as the `/coordinator/status` endpoint returns a JSON containing the time the coordinator started - `{\"serverStartMs\": 1547234982334}`.\r\nThe main motivation behind this PR is that the `/agent/status` is a potentially heavyweight call. I added the `/coordinator/uptime` for consistency","created_at":"2019-01-11T19:30:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T19:52:49Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T19:52:49Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T19:52:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e53fa08af6aba8200f4c7846a8e8e568b56560d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/edfc9d478880e3a0a7e32ca1b8b31813c5ffb890","head":{"label":"stanislavkozlovski:KAFKA-7792-trogdor-uptime","ref":"KAFKA-7792-trogdor-uptime","sha":"edfc9d478880e3a0a7e32ca1b8b31813c5ffb890","user":{"login":"stanislavkozlovski","id":13639618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjM5NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13639618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski","html_url":"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"eb61410a002e95a623425cc89348216a8da56ffe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

introduced the `ConfigProvider` mechanism, which was primarily intended for externalizing secrets provided in connector configurations. However, when querying the Connect REST API for the configuration of a connector or its tasks, those secrets are still exposed. The changes here prevent the Connect REST API from ever exposing resolved configurations in order to address that. @rhauch has given a more thorough writeup of the thinking behind this in [KAFKA-5117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5117)\r\n\r\nTested and verified manually.

I originally refactored the `streams_upgrade_test#upgrade_downgrade_brokers` test I removed the `wait` call which would wait for up 24 minutes for the `SmokeTestDriver` class to publish and verify all of its records. \r\n\r\nSince most of the tests run in two minutes or less I set the `monitor_log` timeout to three minutes.  However, the `SmokeTestDriver#verify` method [allows up to six minutes](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/streams/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/tests/SmokeTestDriver.java#L287) to consume all records before verifying the `monitor_log` timeout needs to be greater than 6 minutes.  I've set the timeout to 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the steps needed to update the `streams_upgrade_test` should be documented as there are several components that need to get updated.

`AdminClient#describeTopics` is called in `WorkerUtils#[getMatchingTopicPartitions,verifyTopics]` only. However, `WorkerUtils#getMatchingTopicPartitions` does not being called by anyone - so it should be removed.\r\n\r\n1. Update `KafkaAdminClient#describeTopics` to throw `UnknownTopicOrPartitionException`.\r\n2. Change the Exception message thrown by `MockAdminClient#describeTopics`: for consistency with `KafkaAdminClient`.\r\n3. Remove unused method: `WorkerUtils#getMatchingTopicPartitions`.\r\n4. Add @throws description on `WorkerUtils#verifyTopics`: when `UnknownTopicOrPartitionException` is thrown.\r\n5. Expand javadoc on `WorkerUtils#createTopics(Logger, AdminClient, Map, boolean)`: the only method which calls `WorkerUtils#verifyTopics`.\r\n\r\nSince the `Throwable` instance thrown by `WorkerUtils#createTopics(Logger, AdminClient, Map, boolean)` is caught by `[ProduceBenchWorker,RoundTripWorker].Prepare`, we don't need more cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Previously, it would ignore `startMs` and expire after `durationMs` milliseconds of local start of the

looking into KAFKA-7657, I found there are a few loopholes in this logic:\r\n\r\nWe kept a map of thread-name to thread-state and a global-thread state at the KafkaStreams instance-level, in addition to the instance state itself. stateLock is used when accessing the instance state, however when we are in the thread state change callback, we are accessing both the thread-states as well as the instance state at the same time in the callers of setState without a lock, which is vulnerable to concurrent multi-stream threads. The fix is a) introduce a threadStatesLock in addition to the stateLock, which should always be grabbed to modify the thread-states map before the stateLock for modifying the instance level; and we also defer the checking of the instance-level state inside the setState call.\r\n\r\nWhen transiting to state.RUNNING, we check if all threads are either in RUNNING or DEAD state, this is because some threads maybe dead at the rebalance period but we should still proceed to RUNNING if the rest of threads are still transiting to RUNNING.\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for 2) above. Also simplified another test as a nit change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-04T22:44:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T00:06:37Z","closed_at":"2019-01-05T05:27:51Z","merged_at":"2019-01-05T05:27:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e4799b017c6a3c65eaf47f60ab136654c9741de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d3a2260b5f3a4130ef75f04a99a584f80a36ee77","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K7657-handling-thread-dead-state-change","ref":"K7657-handling-thread-dead-state-change","sha":"d3a2260b5f3a4130ef75f04a99a584f80a36ee77","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR adds two features: 1) directly execute Trogdor tasks without setting up coordinators and agents, 2) make agents be able to execute shell commands as the worker in another process, so we have the flexibility of running workloads, such as non-Java clients, docker images, etc.\r\n\r\n* Directly execute Trogdor tasks (feature 1).\r\n    * Add TrogdorLocalRunner that reads a task from the spec, executes the task, and\r\nreports results.\r\n    * Add two SPEC examples: consume-bench-spec.json and\r\nproduce-bench-spec.json.\r\n    *  Add/update helper scripts.\r\n    *  Update TROGDOR.md\r\n\r\n* Run the Trogdor worker in a separate process (feature 2).\r\n  * Users pass the worker command in spec.workerCommand, such as\r\n\"workerCommand\": [\"python\", \"./producer.py\"]\r\n  * RuntimeProcessWorker starts the worker in a process by executing\r\n`workercommand --spec TASK_SPEC`.\r\n  * RuntimeProcessWorker monitors the worker's stderr and stdout line by\r\nline, if the stdout line is a JSON value, it updates its status with\r\nthe JSON value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

patch creates an `EndToEndTest` base class which relies on the verifiable consumer. This will ultimately replace `ProduceConsumeValidateTest` which depends on the console consumer. The advantage is that the verifiable consumer exposes more information to use for validation. It also allows for a nicer shutdown pattern. Rather than relying on the console consumer idle timeout, which requires a minimum wait time, we can halt consumption after we have reached the last acked offsets. This should be more reliable and faster. The downside is that the verifiable consumer only works with the new consumer, so we cannot yet convert the upgrade tests.  In this patch, I've converted only the replication tests and a flaky security test to use `EndToEndTest`. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

there,\r\n\r\nthis is my draft implementation of [KIP-394](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-394%3A+Require+member.id+for+initial+join+group+request), requiring member id when the new join group request was received. The current blocker was on the concurrent unit tests, and I figure it would be good to post the implementation at the same time to have some parallel review.\r\n\r\nBasically the major refactor is that we extract all the unknown member handling logic as a separate function called `doUnknownJoinGroup` , and define empty MemberMetadata struct called `unknownMemberMetadata ` which will be inserted into the members list when we receive a valid unknown member join group request. This mock object will be evicted after the rebalance timeout.\r\n\r\nLet me know if the high level implementation makes sense here when you got time @hachikuji @guozhangwang @MayureshGharat @mjsax @stanislavkozlovski \r\n\r\nAlso we created a separate JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7824 for this PR, since 7610 is closed with another PR.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n###

working on #6044, I did code cleanup on the side. Extracted parts of those cleanups into this PR for easier review. This PR should not change any behavior, but do:\r\n\r\n - Java8 rewrites\r\n - removed unused classed\r\n - remove warnings\r\n - break long lines that are hard to read into short lines\r\n - some code re-formatting\r\n - JavaDoc improvements\r\n\r\nOnly change is a dependency change, that I need for #6044, and will make reviewing PRs for KIP-258
