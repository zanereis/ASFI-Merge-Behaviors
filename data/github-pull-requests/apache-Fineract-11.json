Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>google/error-prone (com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.23.0`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.23.0): Error Prone 2.23.0\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`DuplicateDateFormatField`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DuplicateDateFormatField)\n-   [`NonFinalStaticField`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/NonFinalStaticField)\n-   [`StringCharset`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/StringCharset)\n-   [`StringFormatWithLiteral`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/StringFormatWithLiteral)\n-   [`SuperEqualsIsObjectEquals`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/SuperEqualsIsObjectEquals)\n\nBug fixes and improvements: [#&#8203;3897](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3897), [#&#8203;4114](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4114), [#&#8203;4123](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4123)\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.22.0...v2.23.0\n\n### [`v2.22.0`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.22.0): Error Prone 2.22.0\n\nWe are considering raising the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see [#&#8203;3803](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803). Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass `--release 11` to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

It is now entirely configured via startup options and customised via the extension interface so `ResponseTemplateTransformer` should no longer be constructed directly. 2.x code constructing `ResponseTemplateTransformer` will no longer compile so should be removed or migrated to the 3.x style - See [#&#8203;2349](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2349) for detail\n\nPlease note the the legacy recorder has now been deprecated ([7b8a7d](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/commit/7b8a7d351255342d8d22cb5217b6847cc8ddaa29).

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR mitigates potential log injection vulnerabilities found in the Sender.java file. Log Injection vulnerabilities occur when unsanitized user input is written directly to a log entry. A malicious user could potentially exploit this to forge log entries or inject malicious content.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following code:\r\n```\r\nString responseBody = getUserInput();\r\nLOG.log(Level.WARNING, \"Unrecognized response: \" + responseBody);\r\n```\r\nIf a malicious user provides a responseBody that contains newline characters like \"Valid response\\nSomething malicious\", it would be logged as two separate log entries. This could be exploited to forge log entries or to inject malicious content into the logs.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, a new private method sanitize was introduced that replaces newline and carriage return characters in the logs' input strings with their literal equivalents, i.e., \\n and \\r. This method was then used to sanitize responseBody variable in the relevant parts of the code.\r\n\r\nReference: [CWE-117](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/6182)\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [x] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/legacy-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

default statusListener with NopStatusListener so jansi related missing class exception will not be shown.
