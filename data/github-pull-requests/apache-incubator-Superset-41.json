SUMMARY\r\nWhen granting dashboard access to a guest user, it's only granted access to datasets used by its charts. If the dashboard has any native filters powered by datasets that aren't used by any chart, the filter wouldn't load with a permission error. This PR changes this logic to also allow access to datasets used by filters. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before\r\n<img width=\"794\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/d6bb3d1d-04f3-44fc-ab4e-9a87163e5090\">\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/c5e0e7ba-aa1c-4ed0-89f0-cffd99ec561d\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a chart using any dataset.\r\n2. Save the chart and add it to a dashboard.\r\n3. Create a virtual dataset for the same table (a `select * ...` would be enough).\r\n4. Create a dashboard filter using the virtual dataset.\r\n5. Enable embedded access for the dashboard.\r\n6. Create a `guest_token` and grant access to this dashboard.\r\n7. Access this dashboard in embedded mode.\r\n8. Validate that the dashboard filter loads properly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR (alongside https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24789) fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24782. \r\n\r\nSpecifically (per https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24782#issuecomment-1648726754) this PR ensures that the `Save as` menu item is not present when the `DASHBOARD_RBAC` feature is enabled and the user is neither an admin nor an owner. Note it's unclear whether a non-owner (irrespective of the feature flag setting) should ever be able to `Save as` a dashboard, though this PR simply preserves said behavior.\r\n\r\nRegarding the backend logic he [DashboardRestApi.copy_dash](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/554ef07eeda094f5bcc081e7a265e0b7408e0868/superset/dashboards/api.py#L1356-L1420) method invokes the [@with_dashboard](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/554ef07eeda094f5bcc081e7a265e0b7408e0868/superset/dashboards/api.py#L106-L124) decorator which in turn calls [DashboardDAO.get_by_id_or_slug](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/554ef07eeda094f5bcc081e7a265e0b7408e0868/superset/daos/dashboard.py#L58-L81) which has the necessary security checks to ensure ensure said user has access. The conundrum is, if you ask where the user has access to the dashboard the answer is \"yes\", even though we're stating they can't copy it. The solution to this seems to be to add logic within the dashboard DAO.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 5 22 36 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/d9e21578-2fe7-49f9-870b-dcb374a51859\">\r\n\r\n#### AFTER \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 3 50 50 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/e67296e3-0b41-4747-9a4c-0c9e06e19903\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

through the codebase recently in order to fix some dashboard RBAC issues I noticed the `raise_for_dashboard_access` method (drafted prior to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13235) which coincides with the more generic `raise_for_access` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the previous intent to migrate the logic into the `raise_for_access` method which ensures all entity based access checks use the same call stack. Furthermore this approach allows for more context aware checks, i.e., whether a user has access to a dataset/datasource in the context of viewing a dashboard.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\nFixes the filters alert width and also changes the modal width.\r\n\r\nFollowing @kasiazjc's [comment](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24559#issuecomment-1632099115) in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24559: \r\n>  I think in general we have to bump the width of the modal in the default mode to ~880px (and resize just after it not longer fits in the screen), so that everything is more visible.\r\n\r\nI adjusted the modal to have a fixed base width instead of percent based one. I set it to 1000px instead of 880px as a middle ground.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1781\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 11 36 58\"

problem of switching between languages. Currently, Superset has a 60-second timeout when switching languages due to using a memoized function. I added the locale as a dependency for that memoized function.\r\n\r\nCC @bkyryliuk (https://github.com/apache/superset/commit/44654e5abcc70d1fd934529dc82d7fe1d1bb20ef)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/d0b43b3c-16e8-4c1c-9eec-efe911a18b7a\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/d6ba6f8c-8d71-400d-aa13-569453939d30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24806) fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24782.\r\n\r\nPreviously users were granted access to a dataset/chart associated with a dashboard (per the RBAC dashboard roles) however it wasn't context aware, i.e., access was granted irrespective of the context of the request. Specifically this PR ensures that role based dashboard access only occurs within the confines of a dashboard.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n####

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is a partial step towards [SIP-92 Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630) where the `superset.connectors` submodule represents a bygone error of Superset when we supported both the Druid NoSQL and SQLAlchemy database engine connectors. Note long term the `superset.connectors` submodule should be abandoned with the models, views, and utilities moved elsewhere, but I thought it would be prudent to make said change in smaller bites. \r\n\r\nMany of the base models and views are superfluous as they're only extended by one and only class. This PR:\r\n\r\n1. Integrates  the `BaseColumn` and `BaseMetric` classes into the `TableColumn` and `SqlMetric` classes respectively.\r\n2. Integrates the `DatasourceModelView` class into the `TableModelView` class.\r\n3. Moves `superset.connectors.base.models.BaseDatasource` to `superset.connectors.sqla.models.BaseDatasource`.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would love to deprecate the `BaseDatasource` however at this stage I'm not brave enough. Currently (in addition to `SqlaTable` class) the `AnnotationDatasource` class is derived from it and thus sunsetting it is somewhat problematic. We maybe need to remove the `AnnotationDatasource` class somewhat like the `Query` class which behaves somewhat like a datasource/dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nThe horizontal scrollbar in query results has been cut off due to the top margin. There's a bunch of redundant margin for adjustment which makes this kind of overflow hidden regression.\r\nThis commit replaces this margins by the upper wrapper's gap as well as removing the antd style overrides. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"908\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-21 at 1 14 32 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the default unit of line width in deckgl Path and Polygon charts is meter. That leads to some confusion, especially in large scale maps, because users might think that the line is not drawn at all - while in reality it's simply too thin to be visible. This PR addresses that problem by changing the default unit from meters to pixels.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/dc590943-062b-4071-9d97-2d3edf85211e\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a deckgl Path chart\r\n2. Verify that the default line width unit is pixels and default line width is 1 and that drawn line is visible\r\n3. Verify a deckgl Polygons chart\r\n4. Check \"Stroked\" and uncheck \"Extruded\"\r\n5. Verify that line between polygons is visible\r\n6. Verify that existing charts still use meters unit\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a parent filter has been removed, the cascadingParentIds has not updated accordingly.\r\nThis regression caused by the [redux state mutation migration](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23535/files#diff-a0c8ea9949521964211b0fd6059011e3deb0294a81aee69de9c17e780bb8e5b3R316-R320) which remains `filterConfigMap` in obsolete dependency metadata because the redux action will update `state.nativeFilters` whereas `filterConfigMap` references from `state.dashboardInfo.metadata.native_filter_configuration`\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `cleanDeletedParents` logic to retrieve the updated `filterConfigMap` data and then pass to the onSave payload in order to sync the latest updates.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n(See https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24684 for more context.)\r\n\r\nFor security reasons, we need to be able to run SQL Lab queries in user-specified schemas. For example, in SQL Lab, when a user selects the schema `foo` from the dropdown and runs the following query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM some_table;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `some_table` is not fully qualified (it has no schema), we need to:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure the query runs in the `foo` schema, so that the right table is queried.\r\n2. Ensure that the user has permission to query `foo.some_table` (eg, by having access to the `foo` schema).\r\n\r\n[Note that if (1) is not true, we can't do (2), since we don't know the schema of `some_table`.]\r\n\r\nFor Postgres, the way we currently do (1) is by setting `options=-csearch_path=foo` in the connection arguments every time the user runs a query. The problem is that the Postgres DB engine spec **and** the Postgres SQLAlchemy dialect are also used by RDS, which does not support options to be passed this way. In 3.0 RC1 it's not possible to query RDS because the search path is set for every query.\r\n\r\nFortunately there's a way that works for both Postgres and RDS (and hopefully, other databases using the Postgres client): by running the query `set search_path=foo` when the connection is first created.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of \"pre queries\", ie, queries that are run as soon as a raw connection is created. This ensures ensure that the schema (and in the future, catalog) can be set per query correctly for Postgres and potentially other databases (the implementation is per DB-engine spec).\r\n\r\nNote that if DML is enabled it's still possible for users to run `set search_path=bar` in SQL Lab. This could lead to security issues where:\r\n\r\n1. User selects `foo` as the schema in SQL Lab.\r\n2. User runs the query `set search_path=bar; SELECT * FROM some_table`.\r\n3. Superset's security manager will check if the user has access to `some_table`. Since the table name is not fully qualified and the dropdown is set to `foo`, Superset will check for access to `foo.some_table`, even though the table is actually `bar.some_table`.\r\n\r\nThis would allow a malicious user that has access to a given schema (say, `foo`) to query tables in **any** schema by simply choosing `foo` from the schema dropdown in SQL Lab and specifying the search path in the query.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem (at least for Postgres), I extended the `get_default_schema_for_query` to check for `set search_path` and raise an exception if it's there:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-19 at 19-01-35 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/0d2fcdf2-9a5c-4868-8749-be9fe66321f5)\r\n\r\nIdeally, instead of raising an exception we would parse the query to figure out the schema, but this is not trivial. Consider, eg, the following query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nset search_path = foo;\r\nSELECT * FROM some_table;\r\nset search_path = bar;\r\nSELECT * FROM some_other_table;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the complexity of figuring out the correct schema for table in a query with multiple statements, I opted to raise an exception for now, hoping that in the future we can improve this.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

an issue raised by @padbk in https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/24581#discussioncomment-6425918 related to sending an alert/revert via a CSV. The actual error was rather cryptic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Failed generating csv HTTP Error 400: BAD REQUEST\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically the RESTful `/api/v1/chart/{pk}/data/?format=csv` API endpoint was failing with the following error, \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"Request is incorrect: {'queries': {0: {'extras': {'having_druid': ['Unknown field.']}}}}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich turned out to be related to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23997, i.e., the referenced PR (which I authored) didn't remove the now obsolete parameters from the `slices` table. This PR remedies said issue.\r\n\r\nI used Airbnb's vast corpus (consisting of ~ 150k charts) to identify if/where the following form-data key were persisted to the database:\r\n\r\n- `druid_time_origin`\r\n- `having_druid`\r\n- `having_filters`\r\n- `granularity`\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find `having_filters` anywhere, but it was somewhat üò¢ to see that the `druid_time_origin` and `granularity` fields were actually present in three separate places:\r\n\r\n1. In the `slices.params` column\r\n2. In the `form_data` field of the `slices.query_context` column.\r\n3. In the `queries` field of the `slices.query_context` column.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and added/tested the DB migration. After running the migration I then confirmed that that I was successfully able to generate a report sent as a CSV.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nPRs https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24517 and https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24594 introduced support for currencies for saved metrics defined on dataset level. This PR introduces currencies controls in control panel, which applies the currency formatting for all metrics in the chart.\r\nAdditionally, it restyles the column config popover in Table chart - introduced tabs \"Display\" and \"Formatting\" to make the popover cleaner.\r\nAlso, previously World Map didn't have number format control (nor a customize section). I added a Customize section and put number formatting and currency formatting in it.\r\nThe change affects all charts that already supported currencies for saved metrics - most of Echarts (including all Timeseries), Table, Pivot Table, World Map, Heatmap.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNew popover layout in Table chart:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"571\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/419e3b01-f11b-4ec0-8e95-6a28630effcc\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"546\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/1ed61c63-2321-45cf-a7e8-248c478b0ccf\">\r\n\r\nCurrency control in control panel:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1727\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/f135eded-c4ee-4f42-9850-a87064ead2cc\">\r\n\r\nNewly added Customize section in World Map:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/c463b239-915d-4a12-9b82-4c0bfb9fb9a3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe Apache Doris database is based on the MySQL protocol and introduces the concept of Multi Catalog. Therefore, the engine specification of mysqldb will be incompatible with the catalog, and some field types are not the same as those in mysql. To fix these issues, I added the Apache Doris engine specification.\r\n\r\nMain difference:\r\n\r\n- Supports the connection of Doris's Multi Catalog\r\n\r\n- Fixed the problem that only \"BASE TABLE\" was displayed in information_schema\r\n\r\n- Fixed data types for JSONB, DATEV2, DATETIMEV2, DECIMALV3, MAP, STRUCT, LARGEINT, QUANTILE_STATE and AGG_STATE\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes #15825 \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo test this, the following steps can be taken\r\n- Add db connection for cockroach db. \r\n- Create a dataset that includes a table with a timestamp or timestampz column, this will be used as the temporal value when creating charts. \r\n- Create a chart that leverages a temporal value\r\n- Inspect the generated query to see if the date format matches as expected. \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in master and version 2.1.0 with python 3.11. \r\n\r\nIn version 2.1.0 there were code changes needed to the `dict` type, this is due to a python version that was being used in the docker images of version 2.1.0. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ x] Has associated issue: #15825

from legacy pivot table v2 sometimes returns an error due to pieces of  Pivot Table V2 form_data in the legacy pivot. This PR fixes it. Pieces of form_data can occur when users switch from pvt2 tables to legacy pivot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create an save Pivot Table v2 visualization\r\n2. Switch to the legacy pivot table and save\r\n3. Try to migrate and see the error \"Dublicate key\".\r\n\r\nOr just try to migrate form_data that is already generated by me and see the error.\r\n```python\r\n{'adhoc_filters': [],

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nHello!\r\nSuperset 2.1.0 has an issue where the requests made when getting a dashboard repeat the same number of times as the number of slices. This is a significant problem because, for example, if the dashboard size is 1MB and it contains 100 slices, each user opening this dashboard generates 100MB of requests. Considering logs, endpoint checks, etc., it can reach 500-1000MB per user!\r\n\r\nI have fixed this issue by retrieving the dashboard using id, uuid, or slug, and checking the access using the `raise_for_dashboard_access` function, which verifies access to the data sources.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with 2 slices.\r\n2. Set the sqlalchemy logs level to DEBUG.\r\n3. Make a request to dashboard/<id or slug>/charts/.\r\n4. Observe that the dashboard requests are repeated for each slice.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nIn Pandas 2.0 installing the optional but recommended performance dependencies is now possible via pip extras, [reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html#installing-optional-dependencies-with-pip-extras). These deps are also available in 1.5.3 but with the help of pip extras and pip-compile-multi, it should be much cleaner and more obvious as why these deps are installed. I think `pandas[performance]` should be installed in a separate follow-up PR.\r\nThis PR bumps dependency pandas from `1.5.3` to latest stable version `2.0.3` to be able to add these optional dependencies.\r\n\r\nWith Pandas 2.0 we could also potentially\r\n- leverage new pandas features\r\n- mitigate bugs\r\n- improve performance\r\n\r\nChanges in 2.0: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- `scripts/tests/run.sh --module tests/integration_tests/`\r\n- `pytest ./tests/unit_tests/`\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the `Select` component related to searched values that were automatically being selected without an explicit selection from the user. This happens because the [onChange](https://ant.design/components/select#select-props) event is called when a value selection is made or when the input changes. This was only perceived with the introduction of `autoClearSearchValue={false}` in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23869. This PR changes the logic to only fire the `onChange` event when there's an actual selection by the user.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI added a test to the component but we need to check the general use of selects in the application because there are wrappers that override the component behavior such as `SelectControl` and `SelectFilterPlugin`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  -

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI made modifications in two places to try to solve the problem.The problem may be that the time data transmitted by the backend to the

apologies for all the churn, but I'm unable to re-open https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24671 in GitHub as the branch has been forced pushed after the PR was closed.\r\n\r\nDelving a little deeper into the annotation logic I was able to rework the logic in said PR in order for the Cypress tests to pass., i.e., this PR is a superset (no pun intended) of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24671 . Thankfully means that we're able to remove the `TableViz` visualization type which simplifies the visualization logic, i.e., now every chart is defined as either a legacy chart or a non-legacy chart but not both.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen a guest user with an embedded dashboard token tries to access a non-embedded dashboard we allow as long as the other dashboard is in draft or the other dashboard has no datasources or at least one datasource that the user has access.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic, so that guest users have access only if they have the proper token. I also left some comments to the discussion about the `raise_for_dashboard_access`, because the logic is very convoluted, non-intuitive, and remains so for backwards compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nUse a better approach to handle custom default URLs on Datasets. Previously we were validating the URL itself and checked if it belonged to the same request host but this approach is not fail proof.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes all `explore_url` on datasets be handled as relative URLs, relative URLs were already supported and used on this field, now we enforce it when `PREVENT_UNSAFE_DEFAULT_URLS_ON_DATASET`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst working on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24671 I realize that some non-legacy charts (which are invoked via the `/api/v1/chart` RESTful API endpoint) are still present in `superset.viz` meaning the logic outlined in said PR for differentiating between legacy and non-legacy charts was incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the following charts (which were marked as deprecated in 3.0 though in actuality were obsolete):\r\n\r\n- `TableViz`\r\n- `BigNumberViz`\r\n- `BigNumberTotalViz`\r\n\r\nwhich will ensure that the logic in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24671 will be correct.\r\n\r\nTechnically (as illustrated by the augmented tests) these visualization types could be invoked either using the legacy or non-legacy RESTful API endpoint, though in actuality (per the frontend logic) they would only ever be invoked under the later.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nI systematically went through all the visualization types in `superset/viz.py` (all NVD3 and DeckGL charts were bucketed together) and inspected which RESTful API endpoint was being invoked, i.e., any chart using the RESTful `/superset/explore_json` endpoint (or similar) remained.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23012 which was later reverted by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23579 in combination with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23569.\r\n\r\nThe logic defined here is the inverse of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23012, i.e., rather than trying to identify if a chart is a non-legacy chart (via the presence of the query-context‚Äîwhich was problematic), instead we check if the chart is a supported legacy chart/viz type.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22355 the Flask libraries were bumped, however:\r\n\r\n1. Since then, [Flask-WTF 1.1.0](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes/) has resolved an issue with `JSONEncoder`*\r\n2. The upper bounds on several of the packages were fairly restrictive‚Äîtypically the upper bound should be exclusive of the next major version. Note overly restrictive constraints can be problematic when trying to resolve a feasible requirement space, especially for installations which include additional requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\* More specifically the error we (Airbnb) are seeing with Flask-WTF is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.tox/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask_wtf/recaptcha/widgets.py:6: in <module>\r\n  JSONEncoder = json.JSONEncoder\r\n  E   AttributeError: module 'flask.json' has no attribute 'JSONEncoder'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR both bumps and relaxes the Flask libraries (where appropriate) and re-compiles the requirements for CI et al.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

instance configuration)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nchore: bump rockset\r\ndocs: update Rockset usage (include virtual instance configuration)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nsuperset used a very old version of `rockset` (0.8.10). The latest version is 2.0.0. However, SQLAlchemy support no longer comes with `rockset` and has been separated into its own package, [`rockset-sqlalchemy`](https://pypi.org/project/rockset-sqlalchemy/). I have updated `setup.py` to reference this new package. This change should be completely backward compatible.\r\n\r\nThis new package comes with the ability to target specific [virtual instances](https://rockset.com/docs/instances/) through the SQLAlchemy connection URI. I have updated the docs to show this new feature.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1058\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 11 23 55 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/69025547/97152550-0714-4206-82c8-03b02a251f05\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1038\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 11 24 05 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/69025547/518b29af-c0de-45ff-af4a-3e7872203a2b\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create a Rockset collection (you can use one of the Rockset public datasets).\r\n2. Start the superset server and connect to the Rockset database.\r\n3. Create a dataset from the collection.\r\n4. Test that chart creation works.\r\n5. Test that SQL lab works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has
