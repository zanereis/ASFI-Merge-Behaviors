What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen a malformed URL was sent to Executors through `sc.addJar` and `sc.addFile`, the executors become unusable, because they constantly throw `MalformedURLException`s and can never acknowledge that the file or jar is just bad input.\n\nThis PR tries to fix that problem by making sure MalformedURLs can never be submitted through `sc.addJar` and `sc.addFile`. Another solution would be to blacklist bad files and jars on Executors. Maybe fail the first time, and then ignore the second time (but print a warning message).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in SparkContextSuite\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T21:13:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:54:35Z","closed_at":"2016-09-26T05:59:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3d55ae8f14e67926bb71c00dd93824fb9b322ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49afc5686d7ccf9a7864fc9b9c9eb5217a281086","head":{"label":"brkyvz:SPARK-17650","ref":"SPARK-17650","sha":"49afc5686d7ccf9a7864fc9b9c9eb5217a281086","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe Seq[WorkerOffer] is accessed by index, so it really should be an\nIndexedSeq, otherwise an O(n) operation becomes O(n^2).  In practice\nthis hasn't been an issue b/c where these offers are generated, the call\nto `.toSeq` just happens to create an IndexedSeq anyway.I got bitten by\nthis in performance tests I was doing, and its better for the types to be\nmore precise so eg. a change in Scala doesn't destroy performance.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests via jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T19:33:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T19:34:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T19:34:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a920b4d2df29157b19d1dff6588e16bae283fce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2f125253796f967c578a075b2594caa943eb952","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-17648","ref":"SPARK-17648","sha":"f2f125253796f967c578a075b2594caa943eb952","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-2BnW5ibuHIeQzmHEGIGkEcuMUCTk87pmPis2DKRg-Q/edit?usp=sharing) is a design document for this change.** This PR is derived from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11956 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13899.\r\n\r\n**I am splitting this PR into multiple smaller child PRs (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15462, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15467, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15468)  for ease of review.**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a new in-memory cache feature used by `DataFrame.cache` and `Dataset.cache`. The followings are basic design of this PR with suggestions from @davies.  \r\n\r\n1. Use `ColumnarBatch` with `ColumnVector` that are common data representations for columnar storage\r\n2. Use multiple compression scheme (such as RLE, intdelta, and so on) for each `ColumnVector` in `ColumnarBatch` depends on its data type\r\n3. Generate code that is simple and specialized for each in-memory cache to build an in-memory cache\r\n4. Generate code that directly reads data from `ColumnVector` for the in-memory cache by whole-stage codegen.\r\n5. Enhance `ColumnVector` to keep `UnsafeArrayData`\r\n6. Use primitive-type array for primitive uncompressed data type in `ColumnVector`\r\n7. Use `byte[]` for UnsafeArrayData` and compressed data\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantage of this PR improves runtime performance and refactors to use common components.\r\nFor performance, this PR eliminates lots of virtual calls and data copy in old code paths. In particular, for 2-a., this PR avoids data copy from a columnar storage `CachedBatch` to a row-based iterator.\r\nFor refactoring, the following PR may remove unused components for `CachedBatchBytes`.\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\nA `ColumnVector` for all primitive data types in `ColumnarBatch` can be compressed. Currently, there are two ways to enable compression:\r\n1. Set `true` into a property `spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compressed` (default is `true`), or\r\n2. Call DataFrame.persist(st), where st is`MEMORY_ONLY_SER`, `MEMORY_ONLY_SER_2`, `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER`, or `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2`.\r\nThe compression scheme is specified by a property `spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compression.codec` (default is `lz4`).\r\n\r\n**Performance results**\r\n3.4x for building a `CachedColumnarBatch` and getting values (in 1 and 2-a) \r\n\r\n**ToDo: the following PR performs compression for complex data type such as array**\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_91-b14 on Linux 4.4.11-200.fc22.x86_64\r\nIntel Xeon E3-12xx v2 (Ivy Bridge)\r\nCache random keys:                       Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = F compress = T      7211 / 7366          2.3         429.8       1.0X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = F compress = F      2381 / 2460          7.0         141.9       3.0X\r\ncache = F                                      137 /  140        122.7           8.1      52.7X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = T compress = T      2109 / 2252          8.0         125.7       3.4X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = T compress = F      1126 / 1184         14.9          67.1       6.4X\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.2x for getting values (only in 2-a)\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_91-b14 on Linux 4.4.11-200.fc22.x86_64\r\nIntel Xeon E3-12xx v2 (Ivy Bridge)\r\nCache random keys:                       Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = F compress = T      1615 / 1655         41.5          24.1       1.0X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = F compress = F      1603 / 1690         41.9          23.9       1.0X\r\ncache = F                                      444 /  449        151.3           6.6       3.6X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = T compress = T      1404 / 1526         47.8          20.9       1.2X\r\ncache = T columnarBatch = T compress = F       116 /  125        579.0           1.7      13.9X\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Here is an example program**\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nval df = sparkContext.parallelize((1 to 10), 1).map(i => (i, i.toDouble)).toDF(\"i\", \"d\").cache\r\ndf.filter(\"i < 8 and 4.0 < d\").show\r\n```\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRestructure the code and implement two new task assigner.\nPackedAssigner: try to allocate tasks to the executors with least available cores, so that spark can release reserved executors when dynamic allocation is enabled.\n\nBalancedAssigner: try to allocate tasks to the executors with more available cores in order to balance the workload across all executors.\n\nBy default, the original round robin assigner is used.\n\nWe test a pipeline, and new PackedAssigner  save around 45% regarding the reserved cpu and memory with dynamic allocation enabled.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\nBoth unit test in TaskSchedulerImplSuite and manual tests in production pipeline.\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T16:19:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T02:44:53Z","closed_at":"2016-10-16T01:47:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c11569d216963db351b98db3f8f7c3815fd90e61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/98a974756ecf6c7e29a955010b440f4b8f116692","head":{"label":"zhzhan:packed-scheduler","ref":"packed-scheduler","sha":"98a974756ecf6c7e29a955010b440f4b8f116692","user":{"login":"zhzhan","id":4451616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan","html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22663923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjY2MzkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhzhan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhzhan","id":4451616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan","html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#14597 modified `ChiSqSelector` to support `fpr` type selector, however, it left some issue need to be addressed:\n- We should allow users to set selector type explicitly rather than switching them by using different setting function, since the setting order will involves some unexpected issue. For example, if users both set `numTopFeatures` and `percentile`, it will train `kbest` or `percentile` model based on the order of setting (the latter setting one will be trained). This make users confused, and we should allow users to set selector type explicitly. We handle similar issues at other place of ML code base such as `GeneralizedLinearRegression` and `LogisticRegression`.\n- Meanwhile, if there are more than one parameter except `alpha` can be set for `fpr` model, we can not handle it elegantly in the existing framework. And similar issues for `kbest` and `percentile` model. Setting selector type explicitly can solve this issue also.\n- If setting selector type explicitly by users is allowed, we should handle param interaction such as if users set `selectorType = percentile` and `alpha = 0.1`, we should notify users the parameter `alpha` will take no effect. We should handle complex parameter interaction checks at `transformSchema`. (FYI #11620)\n- We should use lower case of the selector type names to follow MLlib convention.\n- Add ML Python API.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUnivariate feature selection works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests. \nFDR and FWE are a popular univariate statistical test for feature selection.  \nIn 2005, the Benjamini and Hochberg paper on FDR was identified as one of the 25 most-cited statistical papers. The FDR uses the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure in this PR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate. \nIn statistics, FWE is the probability of making one or more false discoveries, or type I errors, among all the hypotheses when performing multiple hypotheses tests.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate\n\nWe add  FDR and FWE methods for ChiSqSelector in this PR, like it is implemented in scikit-learn. \nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#univariate-feature-selection\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nut will be added soon\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently with [SPARK-15698](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15698), FileStreamSource metadata log will be compacted periodically (10 batches by default), this means compacted batch file will contain whole file entries been processed. With the time passed, the compacted batch file will be accumulated to a very large file.\n\nWith [SPARK-17165](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17165), now FileStreamSource doesn't track the aged file entry in memory, but in the log we still keep the full logs, this is not necessary and quite time-consuming during recovery. So here propose to also add file entry purging ability to remove aged file entries.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added.\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T03:13:20Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T00:02:54Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T00:02:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a1227a26bd9108c59eb3da15cfc0b271cbc9d6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20a6c4b2116c8b41bf675e40c0bb9a5297225051","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-17604","ref":"SPARK-17604","sha":"20a6c4b2116c8b41bf675e40c0bb9a5297225051","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe added native versions of `collect_set` and `collect_list` in Spark 2.0. These currently also (try to) collect null values, this is different from the original Hive implementation. This PR fixes this by adding a null check to the `Collect.update` method.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a regression test to `DataFrameAggregateSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T01:48:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T23:27:24Z","closed_at":"2016-09-28T23:27:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb35a8a6ff8e6046123a83ccb1c797c66846935b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80b2166c62b449eae4032eb96be39b9d8659ba8a","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17641","ref":"SPARK-17641","sha":"80b2166c62b449eae4032eb96be39b9d8659ba8a","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

there's a scalability problem with cached relations, in that\nstats for every column, for each partition, are captured in the driver.\nFor large tables that leads to lots and lots of memory usage.\n\nThis change modifies the accumulator used to capture stats in the\ndriver to summarize the data as it arrives, instead of collecting\neverything and then summarizing it.\n\nPreviously, for each column, the driver needed:\n\n  (64 + 2 \\* sizeof(type)) \\* number of partitions\n\nWith the change, the driver requires a fixed 8 bytes per column.\n\nOn top of that, the change fixes a second problem dealing with how\nstatistics of cached relations that share stats with another one\n(e.g. a cached projection of a cached relation) are calculated; previously,\nthe data would be wrong since the accumulator data would be summarized\nbased on the child output (while the data reflected the parent's output).\nNow the calculation is done based on how the child's output maps to the\nparent's output, yielding the correct size.\n\nTested with the new unit test (which makes sure the calculated stats are\ncorrect), and by looking at the relation size in a heap dump.\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T22:58:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T22:58:12Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T21:39:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fb783509e0f5d7d13460ae06b366cd294b2cff8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b3a65a02210c696206546c43403867bcc9eb077","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-17549","ref":"SPARK-17549","sha":"5b3a65a02210c696206546c43403867bcc9eb077","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently cannot execute an aggregate that contains a single distinct aggregate function and an one or more non-partially plannable aggregate functions, for example:\n\n``` sql\nselect   grp, \n         collect_list(col1),\n         count(distinct col2)\nfrom     tbl_a\ngroup by 1\n```\n\nThis is a regression from Spark 1.6. This is caused by the fact that the single distinct aggregation code path assumes that all aggregates can be planned in two phases (is partially aggregatable). This PR works around this issue by triggering the `RewriteDistinctAggregates` in such cases (this is similar to the approach taken in 1.6).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCreated `RewriteDistinctAggregatesSuite` which checks if the aggregates with distinct aggregate functions get rewritten into two `Aggregates` and an `Expand`. Added a regression test to `DataFrameAggregateSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T22:23:20Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T21:31:39Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T21:31:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5dd28b86a882df761aa9d5e9b07ecc31a824647","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bda0ba0366a5c398dc6144219c7e4cf03d81dad8","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17616","ref":"SPARK-17616","sha":"bda0ba0366a5c398dc6144219c7e4cf03d81dad8","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

patch is a branch-1.6 backport of #15037:\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn Spark's `RDD.getOrCompute` we first try to read a local copy of a cached RDD block, then a remote copy, and only fall back to recomputing the block if no cached copy (local or remote) can be read. This logic works correctly in the case where no remote copies of the block exist, but if there _are_ remote copies and reads of those copies fail (due to network issues or internal Spark bugs) then the BlockManager will throw a `BlockFetchException` that will fail the task (and which could possibly fail the whole job if the read failures keep occurring).\n\nIn the cases of TorrentBroadcast and task result fetching we really do want to fail the entire job in case no remote blocks can be fetched, but this logic is inappropriate for reads of cached RDD blocks because those can/should be recomputed in case cached blocks are unavailable.\n\nTherefore, I think that the `BlockManager.getRemoteBytes()` method should never throw on remote fetch errors and, instead, should handle failures by returning `None`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBlock manager changes should be covered by modified tests in `BlockManagerSuite`: the old tests expected exceptions to be thrown on failed remote reads, while the modified tests now expect `None` to be returned from the `getRemote*` method.\n\nI also manually inspected all usages of `BlockManager.getRemoteValues()`, `getRemoteBytes()`, and `get()` to verify that they correctly pattern-match on the result and handle `None`. Note that these `None` branches are already exercised because the old `getRemoteBytes` returned `None` when no remote locations for the block could be found (which could occur if an executor died and its block manager de-registered with the master).\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T21:29:23Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T18:06:32Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T18:06:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa6e3fc38cc6e897080af5b5a78dd2f036dfeb96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/af88ada7548e8988f491997b929f30436353c20a","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17485-branch-1.6-backport","ref":"SPARK-17485-branch-1.6-backport","sha":"af88ada7548e8988f491997b929f30436353c20a","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch addresses a correctness bug in Spark 1.6.x in where `coalesce()` declares that it can process `UnsafeRows` but mis-declares that it always outputs safe rows. If UnsafeRow and other Row types are compared for equality then we will get spurious `false` comparisons, leading to wrong answers in operators which perform whole-row comparison (such as `distinct()` or `except()`). An example of a query impacted by this bug is given in the [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17618).\n\nThe problem is that the validity of our row format conversion rules depends on operators which handle `unsafeRows` (signalled by overriding `canProcessUnsafeRows`) correctly reporting their output row format (which is done by overriding `outputsUnsafeRows`). In #9024, we overrode `canProcessUnsafeRows` but forgot to override `outputsUnsafeRows`, leading to the incorrect `equals()` comparison.\n\nOur interface design is flawed because correctness depends on operators correctly overriding multiple methods this problem could have been prevented by a design which coupled row format methods / metadata into a single method / class so that all three methods had to be overridden at the same time.\n\nThis patch addresses this issue by adding missing `outputsUnsafeRows` overrides. In order to ensure that bugs in this logic are uncovered sooner, I have modified `UnsafeRow.equals()` to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is called with an object that is not an `UnsafeRow`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI believe that the stronger misuse-checking in `UnsafeRow.equals()` is sufficient to detect and prevent this class of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen converting `SimpleCatalogRelation` to `LogicalRelation`, we also need to set `expectedOutputAttributes`, then the output in `LogicalRelation` is the attributes in `expectedOutputAttributes`, otherwise, it will use its schema to generate new attributes (and new exprId's), so the output of LogicalRelation will be different from output of SimpleCatalogRelation.\n\nAs a result, if we have a table in `InMemoryCatalog`, we can't lookup it (get a `SimpleCatalogRelation`) and then use it to compose `LogicalPlan`s.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadd a test case\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T17:51:13Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T16:56:41Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T06:51:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a0550802e8f116d377aa0f726b55b15dea75ad3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2c3b9df0431885efbc9575beb7735590a77cf2f","head":{"label":"wzhfy:expectedAttributes","ref":"expectedAttributes","sha":"e2c3b9df0431885efbc9575beb7735590a77cf2f","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of broadcast in Spark is to collect the result of an RDD and then broadcast it. This introduces some extra latency. We can broadcast the RDD directly from executors. This patch implements broadcast from executors, and applies it on broadcast join of Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of executor-size broadcast:\r\n\r\n* The data of RDD doesn't need to collect to the driver before broadcasting\r\n* The driver isn't the bottleneck of data transmission at the beginning of broadcasting\r\n\r\nDesign document: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12831201/executor-side-broadcast.pdf\r\n## Major API changes\r\n- New API `broadcastRDDOnExecutor` in `SparkContext`\r\n  \r\n  It takes two parameters `rdd: RDD[T]` and `mode: BroadcastMode[T]`. It will broadcast the content of the rdd between executors without collecting it back to the driver. `mode` is used to convert the content of the rdd to the broadcasted object.\r\n  \r\n  Besides `T`, this API has another type parameter `U`, which is the type of the converted object.\r\n- New `Broadcast` implementation  `TorrentExecutorBroadcast`\r\n  \r\n  Different to `TorrentBroadcast`, this implementation doesn't divide and store object data waiting to broadcast in the driver. The executors use local and remote fetches to fetch the blocks of the RDD and convert the rdd content to broadcasted object.\r\n- `BroadcastMode` is moved from `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.physical` to `org.apache.spark.broadcast`\r\n  \r\n  It is added a type parameter `T` now which is the converted type of the  broadcasted object on executors.\r\n## Usage: How to use executor side broadcast\r\n\r\nTo broadcast the result of a RDD, instead of collecting the result back to the driver and broadcasting it, we can use executor side broadcast feature proposed in this proposal.\r\n1. Prepare the RDD to be broadcast\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   // To broadcast the RDD on executors,\r\n   // we should materialize and cache the result of the RDD\r\n   val rdd = sc.parallelize(1 to 4, 2).cache()\r\n   rdd.count()\r\n   ```\r\n2. Define how to transform the result of the RDD with `BroadcastMode`\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   val mode = new BroadcastMode[Int] {\r\n     override def transform(rows: Array[Int]): Array[Int] = rows\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n3. Broadcast the RDD and use broadcasted variable\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   val broadcastedVal = sc.broadcastRDDOnExecutor[Int, Array[Int]](rdd, mode)\r\n   val collected = sc.parallelize(1 to 2, 2).map { _ =>\r\n     broadcastedVal.value.reduce(_ + _) // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\r\n   }.collect()\r\n   assert(collected.sum == 20)\r\n   ```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-09-21T08:39:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:53Z","closed_at":"2017-11-01T01:45:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a172f00650b5d537bd54250a982db1e12a941b73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1f2faa99f7b6875885820893070c8b039ecddd7","head":{"label":"viirya:broadcast-on-executors","ref":"broadcast-on-executors","sha":"a1f2faa99f7b6875885820893070c8b039ecddd7","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15054 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15160 to Spark 2.0.\n- When the permanent tables/views do not exist but the temporary view exists, the expected error should be `NoSuchTableException` for partition-related ALTER TABLE commands. However, it always reports a confusing error message. For example, \n\n```\nPartition spec is invalid. The spec (a, b) must match the partition spec () defined in table '`testview`';\n```\n- When the permanent tables/views do not exist but the temporary view exists, the expected error should be `NoSuchTableException` for `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES`. However, it reports a missing table property. For example, \n\n```\nAttempted to unset non-existent property 'p' in table '`testView`';\n```\n- When `ANALYZE TABLE` is called on a view or a temporary view, we should issue an error message. However, it reports a strange error:\n\n```\nANALYZE TABLE is not supported for Project\n```\n- When inserting into a temporary view that is generated from `Range`, we will get the following error message:\n\n```\nassertion failed: No plan for 'InsertIntoTable Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(1)), false, false\n+- Project [1 AS 1#20]\n   +- OneRowRelation$\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix the above four issues.\n\nThere is no place in Spark SQL that need `SessionCatalog.tableExists` to check temp views, so this PR makes `SessionCatalog.tableExists` only check permanent table/view and removes some hacks.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded multiple test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDIGEST-MD5 mechanism is used for SASL authentication and secure communication. DIGEST-MD5 mechanism supports 3DES, DES, and RC4 ciphers. However, 3DES, DES and RC4 are slow relatively.\n\nAES provide better performance and security by design and is a replacement for 3DES according to NIST. Apache Common Crypto is a cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI, this patch employ Apache Common Crypto as enc/dec backend for SASL authentication and secure channel to improve spark RPC.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests and Integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemainder(%) expression's `eval()` returns incorrect result when the dividend is a big double. The reason is that Remainder converts the double dividend to decimal to do \"%\", and that lose precision.\n\nThis bug only affects the `eval()` that is used by constant folding, the codegen path is not impacted.\n### Before change\n\n```\nscala> -5083676433652386516D % 10\nres2: Double = -6.0\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"select -5083676433652386516D % 10 as a\").show\n+---+\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nConsider you have a bucket as `s3a://some-bucket`\nand under it you have files:\n\n```\ns3a://some-bucket/file1.parquet\ns3a://some-bucket/file2.parquet\n```\n\nGetting the parent path of `s3a://some-bucket/file1.parquet` yields\n`s3a://some-bucket/` and the ListingFileCatalog uses this as the key in the hash map.\n\nWhen catalog.allFiles is called, we use `s3a://some-bucket` (no slash at the end) to get the list of files, and we're left with an empty list! \n\nThis PR fixes this by adding a `/` at the end of the `URI` iff the given `Path` doesn't have a parent, i.e. is the root. This is a no-op if the path already had a `/` at the end, and is handled through the Hadoop Path, path merging semantics. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis change makes the scheduler in `StreamExecution` adjust its rate of polling to the rate of data arrival. I used the [AIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_increase/multiplicative_decrease) algorithm, aka TCP congestion avoidance, because it is simple. I renamed\n`spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay` to `spark.sql.streaming.minPollingDelay` and added a second parameter `spark.sql.streaming.maxPollingDelay` to serve as an upper bound. This upper bound is necessary because the data arrival rate could be bursty, with infinite variance.\n\nThis approach works, but I'm not completely satisfied with the current design. The blocking-system-call part of polling really ought to be delegated to the sources themselves, so that the main scheduler thread won't be blocked for unpredictable amounts of time. Also, the polling rate ought to be adaptive on a per-source basis, instead of there being a single global rate per session. Leaving this PR marked as WIP for now.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested for three scenarios:\n- If data is not present, the scheduler ramps up the polling delay quickly to `spark.sql.streaming.maxPollingDelay`\n- If data arrives quickly, the scheduler keeps its polling delay pinned at `spark.sql.streaming.minPollingDelay`\n- If new batches arrive at a constant interval between the minimum and maximum delay, the scheduler keeps its polling delay within a factor of two of the actual arrival rate.\n\nThe testing code is included in this PR. Note that the test cases for the two latter cases are disabled by default, because they are somewhat timing dependent.\n","created_at":"2016-09-20T17:25:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T22:49:19Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T22:49:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfcf1e47859626cb003d67fccd908c01f4ca8c4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4439d07e79ca48b5037ecb50017013c75172f6af","head":{"label":"frreiss:fred-17386a","ref":"fred-17386a","sha":"4439d07e79ca48b5037ecb50017013c75172f6af","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61155195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTE1NTE5NQ==","name":"spark-fred","full_name":"frreiss/spark-fred","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss/spark-fred","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAfter #15054 , there is no place in Spark SQL that need `SessionCatalog.tableExists` to check temp views, so this PR makes `SessionCatalog.tableExists` only check permanent table/view and removes some hacks.\n\nThis PR also improves the `getTempViewOrPermanentTableMetadata` that is introduced in  #15054 , to make the code simpler.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt is mostly for yarn mode, standalone mode don't need to distribute resources (sparkr.zip, pyspark.zip and etc) if I understand correctly. Add 2 options spark.usePython and spark.useR, so that any project using both sparkR and pyspark can leverage these 2 options. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUse the following command to launch SparkPi and notice pyspark.zip, sparkr.zip and py4j are all distirbuted to executors. \n\n```\nbin/spark-submit --master yarn-client --conf spark.useR=true --conf spark.usePython=true --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.11-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n```\n\nClient output\n\n```\n16/09/20 16:25:15 INFO Client: Uploading resource

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor non-partitioned tables, Hive-generated statistics are stored in table properties. However, for partitioned tables, Hive-generated statistics are stored in partition properties. Thus, we are unable to utilize the Hive-generated statistics for partitioned tables. \n\nThe statistics might not be gathered for all the partitions in Hive. For partial collection, we will not utilize the Hive-generated statistics.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-09-20T04:57:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T00:22:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-16T23:43:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07722f3dd6295ba09e9f46084c5212375107a4b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/061e60b3af819f235e531b1de24f136a431dc23c","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:partitionedTableStatistics","ref":"partitionedTableStatistics","sha":"061e60b3af819f235e531b1de24f136a431dc23c","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsing SparkSession in Spark 2.0 to read a Hive table which is stored as parquet files and if there has been a schema evolution from int to long of a column, we will get java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableLong cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableInt. To be specific, if there are some old parquet files using int for the column while some new parquet files use long and the Hive metastore uses Long as its type, the aforementioned exception will be thrown. Because Hive and Presto deem this kind of schema evolution is valid, this PR allows writing a int value when its table schema is long in hive metastore.\n\nThis is for non-vectorized parquet, will create a separate JIRA for vectorized parquet reader and come up with a fix later.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test to create parquet files with int type in the schema and create hive table using long as its type. Then perform spark.sql(\"select \\* from table\") to query all data from this table.\n","created_at":"2016-09-19T22:30:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T20:42:13Z","closed_at":"2016-09-26T20:42:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c88f2de0da94eefa9cd3ab5a60be57c2008ccde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8104158a922d86dd4f00e50d5d7dddc7b777a21","head":{"label":"wgtmac:master","ref":"master","sha":"d8104158a922d86dd4f00e50d5d7dddc7b777a21","user":{"login":"wgtmac","id":4684607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODQ2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4684607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac","html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52826553,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgyNjU1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"wgtmac/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wgtmac","id":4684607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODQ2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4684607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac","html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFloor()/Ceil() of decimal is implemented using changePrecision() by passing a rounding mode, but the rounding mode is not respected when the decimal is in compact mode (could fit within a Long). \n\nThis Update the changePrecision() to respect rounding mode, which could be ROUND_FLOOR, ROUND_CEIL, ROUND_HALF_UP, ROUND_HALF_EVEN.\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe code in `Word2VecModel.findSynonyms` to choose the vocabulary elements with the highest similarity to the query vector currently sorts the collection of similarities for every vocabulary element. This involves making multiple copies of the collection of similarities while doing a (relatively) expensive sort. It would be more efficient to find the best matches by maintaining a bounded priority queue and populating it with a single pass over the vocabulary, and that is exactly what this patch does.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch adds no user-visible functionality and its correctness should be exercised by existing tests.  To ensure that this approach is actually faster, I made a microbenchmark for `findSynonyms`:\n\n```\nobject W2VTiming {\n  import org.apache.spark.{SparkContext, SparkConf}\n  import org.apache.spark.mllib.feature.Word2VecModel\n  def run(modelPath: String, scOpt: Option[SparkContext] = None) {\n    val sc = scOpt.getOrElse(new SparkContext(new SparkConf(true).setMaster(\"local[*]\").setAppName(\"test\")))\n    val model = Word2VecModel.load(sc, modelPath)\n    val keys = model.getVectors.keys\n    val start = System.currentTimeMillis\n    for(key <- keys) {\n      model.findSynonyms(key, 5)\n      model.findSynonyms(key, 10)\n      model.findSynonyms(key, 25)\n      model.findSynonyms(key, 50)\n    }\n    val finish = System.currentTimeMillis\n    println(\"run completed in \" + (finish - start) + \"ms\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI ran this test on a model generated from the complete works of Jane Austen and found that the new approach was over 3x faster than the old approach.  (If the `num` argument to `findSynonyms` is very close to the vocabulary size, the new approach will have less of an advantage over the old one.)\n","created_at":"2016-09-19T14:41:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T08:47:17Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T08:47:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4cd057ec8be0190d74fe5855512b232246675775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b235dc1eaf84c7f24cc6090153bd7b4f78da35d","head":{"label":"willb:SPARK-17595","ref":"SPARK-17595","sha":"4b235dc1eaf84c7f24cc6090153bd7b4f78da35d","user":{"login":"willb","id":1161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb","html_url":"https://github.com/willb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17481019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQ4MTAxOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"willb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"willb","id":1161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb","html_url":"https://github.com/willb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/willb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImplement Locality Sensitive Hashing along with approximate nearest neighbors and approximate similarity join based on the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D15DTDMF_UWTTyWqXfG7y76iZalky4QmifUYQ6lH5GM/edit).\n\nDetailed changes are as follows:\n(1) Implement abstract LSH, LSHModel classes as Estimator-Model\n(2) Implement approxNearestNeighbors and approxSimilarityJoin in the abstract LSHModel\n(3) Implement Random Projection as LSH subclass for Euclidean distance, Min Hash for Jaccard Distance\n(4) Implement unit test utility methods including checkLshProperty, checkNearestNeighbor and checkSimilarityJoin\n\nThings that will be implemented in a follow-up PR:\n- Bit Sampling for Hamming Distance, SignRandomProjection for Cosine Distance\n- PySpark Integration for the scala classes and methods.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test is implemented for all the implemented classes and algorithms. A scalability test on Uber's dataset was performed internally.\n\nTested the methods on [WEX dataset](https://aws.amazon.com/items/2345) from AWS, with the steps and results

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllows flexibility in handling additional ISO 8601 time offset variants. The current parsing of ISO 8601 is exclusive to W3C's datetime note (and XML Schema datetime). This change will allow offset to be handled as \"HH:MM\", \"HHMM\" and \"HH\".\n\nThis is one suggested approach to handling these variants. The other suggestions are to switch back to SimpleDateFormat and utilize the 'X' pattern flag. Another suggestion is to wait for a future release of commons-lang. Either of these suggestions can be implemented later over top of this suggestion.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe patch was tested by running all existing unit tests and by augmenting the existing tests with additional assertions.\n","created_at":"2016-09-19T02:29:52Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T00:27:19Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T00:05:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37b4f2d0db71cabefcdc182f887f27e198f23a76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db2e1f0c0b6bbf4683bbc2b876500141961becc0","head":{"label":"nbeyer:master","ref":"master","sha":"db2e1f0c0b6bbf4683bbc2b876500141961becc0","user":{"login":"nbeyer","id":121554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer","html_url":"https://github.com/nbeyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbeyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8f0c35a4d0dd458719627be5f524792bf244d70a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsers would like to add a directory as dependency in some cases, they can use `SparkContext.addFile` with argument `recursive=true` to recursively add all files under the directory by using Scala. But Python users can only add file not directory, we should also make it supported.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#14881 added Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test wrapper to SparkR. I found that `print.summary.KSTest` was implemented inappropriately and result in no effect.\n\nRunning the following code for KSTest:\n\n``` Scala\ndata <- data.frame(test = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, -1, -0.5))\ndf <- createDataFrame(data)\ntestResult <- spark.kstest(df, \"test\", \"norm\")\nsummary(testResult)\n```\n\nBefore this PR:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/18615016/b9a2823a-7d4f-11e6-934b-128beade355e.png)\nAfter this PR: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1962026/18615014/aafe2798-7d4f-11e6-8b99-c705bb9fe8f2.png)\nThe new implementation is similar with [`print.summary.GeneralizedLinearRegressionModel`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/R/pkg/R/mllib.R#L284) of SparkR and [`print.summary.glm`](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/stats/R/glm.R) of native R.\n\nBTW, I removed the comparison of `print.summary.KSTest` in unit test, since it's only wrappers of the summary output which has been checked. Another reason is that these comparison will output summary information to the test console, it will make the test output in a mess.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test.\n","created_at":"2016-09-18T10:21:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T03:17:52Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T03:16:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1947707a0ad2b76dcbf779534284d3c59ba794b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15139/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15139/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15139/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c5c4ff8ae3ef9d050c404007ac2c114353fb2cc","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-17315","ref":"spark-17315","sha":"5c5c4ff8ae3ef9d050c404007ac2c114353fb2cc","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR includes the changes below:\n1. Upgrade Univocity library from 2.1.1 to 2.2.1\n   \n   This includes some performance improvement and also enabling auto-extending buffer in `maxCharsPerColumn` option in CSV. Please refer the [release notes](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases).\n2. Remove useless `rowSeparator` variable existing in `CSVOptions`\n   \n   We have this unused variable in [CSVOptions.scala#L127](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/29952ed096fd2a0a19079933ff691671d6f00835/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/csv/CSVOptions.scala#L127) but it seems possibly causing confusion that it actually does not care of `\\r\\n`. For example, we have an issue open about this, [SPARK-17227](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17227), describing this variable.\n   \n   This variable is virtually not being used because we rely on `LineRecordReader` in Hadoop which deals with only both `\\n` and `\\r\\n`.\n3. Set the default value of `maxCharsPerColumn` to auto-expending.\n   \n   We are setting 1000000 for the length of each column. It'd be more sensible we allow auto-expending rather than fixed length by default.\n   \n   To make sure, using `-1` is being described in the release note, [2.2.0](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/releases/tag/v2.2.0).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-09-18T09:16:46Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:35Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T09:37:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d84af9caecce1b1bcf593c07349177a50ca78742","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/70cb567eb0980517b0c31d8c0e9a6e0cd6166998","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17583","ref":"SPARK-17583","sha":"70cb567eb0980517b0c31d8c0e9a6e0cd6166998","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nYarn and mesos cluster mode support remote python path (HDFS/S3 scheme) by their own mechanism, it is not necessary to check and format the python when running on these modes. This is a potential regression compared to 1.6, so here propose to fix it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test to verify SparkSubmit arguments, also with local cluster verification. Because of lack of `MiniDFSCluster` support in Spark unit test, there's no integration test added.\n","created_at":"2016-09-18T07:38:18Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T12:54:17Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T21:55:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a613cd912ccecf314e956e59d470494845a1073","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d136155a734d1e779faa96b0a864c3ded739141f","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-17512","ref":"SPARK-17512","sha":"d136155a734d1e779faa96b0a864c3ded739141f","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith pyspark dataframe, the agg method just support two ways, one is to give the column and agg method maps and another one is to use agg functions in package functions  to apply on specific columns names. The two approach both ask us to asign a method on specific columns names. But if\nI want to apply the agg method on all other numeric columns, I should list all method-column combinations. such as, suppose the df has to columns province,age,income, I want to groupby the province and calculate the min, max and average values on age and income, before change I have to approach: df.groupby('province').agg({'age':'max','age':'min','age':'avg','income':'max','income':'min','income':'avg'})\ndf.groupby('province').agg({F.min('age'),F.max('age'),F.avg('age'),F.min('income'),F.max('income'),F.avg('income')}), which are both redundant.\n\nwith this change, we can simply replace the code with df.groupby('province').agg('max','min','avg')\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nScala/Python users can add files to Spark job by submit options `--files` or `SparkContext.addFile()`. Meanwhile, users can get the added file by `SparkFiles.get(filename)`.\nWe should also support this function for SparkR users, since they also have the requirements for some shared dependency files. For example, SparkR users can download third party R packages to driver firstly, add these files to the Spark job as dependency by this API and then each executor can install these packages by `install.packages`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd unit test.\n","created_at":"2016-09-17T15:50:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T14:52:12Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T03:10:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b8e568301c4b6ae97008cad745abc09c1c1e326","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ed3c68d752914100a86d04a420ad839a7ed992c","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-17577","ref":"spark-17577","sha":"9ed3c68d752914100a86d04a420ad839a7ed992c","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe have the rule `ReuseExchange` to reuse exchange in the physical plan. However, for a `ShuffleExchange` we still need to retrieve remote blocks again when the shuffle exchange is reused. We can cache the RDD of the reused `ShuffleExchange` to avoid transferring remote blocks again.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual tests show this patch can avoid transferring remote blocks again when a shuffle exchange is reused.\n","created_at":"2016-09-17T09:41:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-17T11:43:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30151caa057338f4fe3271e1830a8ce597a093ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cbbaf318ecb9e21df464f487dd4dbb37ceee3923","head":{"label":"viirya:cache-reused-shuffle","ref":"cache-reused-shuffle","sha":"cbbaf318ecb9e21df464f487dd4dbb37ceee3923","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAssertOnQuery has two apply constructor: one that accepts a closure that returns boolean, and another that accepts a closure that returns Unit. This is actually very confusing because developers could mistakenly think that AssertOnQuery always require a boolean return type and verifies the return result, when indeed the value of the last statement is ignored in one of the constructors.\n\nThis pull request makes the two constructor consistent and always require boolean value. It will overall make the test suites more robust against developer errors.\n\nAs an evidence for the confusing behavior, this change also identified a bug with an existing test case due to file system time granularity. This pull request fixes that test case as well.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test only change.\n","created_at":"2016-09-17T07:37:12Z","updated_at":"2016-09-18T22:24:09Z","closed_at":"2016-09-18T22:24:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d75f54caf180794ff4153409731e18bdaa411994","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d013acf3b8a258d12dbe61a2d348ccfc4f099fb6","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17571","ref":"SPARK-17571","sha":"d013acf3b8a258d12dbe61a2d348ccfc4f099fb6","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror
