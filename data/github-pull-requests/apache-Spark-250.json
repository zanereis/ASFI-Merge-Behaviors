What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe existing Ceil and Floor case classes in SQL mathExpressions.scala doesn't support double well.\r\nWhen using large doubles in the query, LongType max will be returned instead of the correct large double values (e.g. select ceil(double(1.2345678901234e+200)), ceiling(double(1.2345678901234e+200)), floor(double(1.2345678901234e+200)); used in the ticket).\r\n\r\nIn this patch, better double support is added. Now the data overflow bug has been fixed by this patch, also now Ceil and Floor has correct semantics in certain use cases, e.g. double should be returned when input param is double. In the existing code, long will be the default return type regardless of the input data types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll spark unit tests:\r\n./build/sbt test\r\n\r\nAll SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded support for arithmetic expressions, use of spark functions and registered udf's inside formula so that expressions like this work as intended in `RFormula`;\r\n\r\n`log(y) ~ a + pow(b, 2)`  ->  `log()` and `pow()` spark functions are used on `y` and `b`\r\n`I(y +b) ~ a + x` -> The label term is sum of `y` and `b`\r\n\r\nUdf's can also be used once they're registered:\r\n```scala\r\n  val registeredUdf = spark.udf.register(\"plusTwo\", (x: Int) => (x + 2))\r\n  val formula = new RFormula()\r\n    .setFormula(\"plusTwo(y) ~ a +

`EvalExprParser` trait for parsing arithmetic expressions inside formula\r\n- Added `ExprSelector` transformer which adds columns to a dataframe using `expr` spark function\r\n- Add `ExprSelector` and `ColumnPruner` stages for parsed arithmetic expressions.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for parsing a term as arithmetic expression is that it's inside 'I(' expression ')', or it's a function (function criteria is ascii chars + alphanumeric chars + '(' args ')' ). From parsed arithmetic expressions, features are generated using `expr` spark function, so anything that can be used with `expr` function should be valid.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a DDL command `SHOW CREATE TABLE AS SERDE`. It is used to generate Hive DDL for a Hive table.\r\n\r\nFor original `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, it now shows Spark DDL always. If given a Hive table, it tries to generate Spark DDL.\r\n\r\nFor Hive serde to data source conversion, this uses the existing mapping inside `HiveSerDe`. If can't find a mapping there, throws an analysis exception on unsupported serde configuration.\r\n\r\nIt is arguably that some Hive fileformat + row serde might be mapped to Spark data source, e.g., CSV. It is not included in this PR. To be conservative, it may not be supported.\r\n\r\nFor Hive serde properties, for now this doesn't save it to Spark DDL because it may not useful to keep Hive serde properties in Spark table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24634 to see rationalization of the issue.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new metric to count the number of rows arrived later than watermark plus allowed delay. To count the number of rows correctly, this patch adds a new physical node before stateful operator node(s) which counts the number of input rows later than watermark plus allowed delay. \r\n\r\nNote that it doesn't mean these rows will be always discarded, since there're some cases we don't discard late input rows, e.g. non-window streaming aggregation.\r\n\r\nThe metric will be exposed to two places:\r\n\r\n* streaming query listener - numLateInputRows in stateOperators\r\n* SQL tab in UI - `number of input rows later than watermark plus allowed delay` in CountLateRowsExec\r\n\r\nThis is a revised version of #21617.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT, and ran manual test reproducing [SPARK-28094](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28094).\r\n\r\nI've picked the specific case on \"B outer C outer D\" which is enough to represent the \"intermediate late row\" issue due to global watermark.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/jammann/b58bfbe0f4374b89ecea63c1e32c8f17\r\n\r\nSpark logs warning message on the query which means [SPARK-28074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28074) is working correctly,\r\n\r\n```\r\n19/10/01 15:38:53 WARN UnsupportedOperationChecker: Detected pattern of possible 'correctness' issue due to global watermark.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUsing FileStreamSource to read files from a S3 bucket has problems both in terms of costs and latency:\r\n\r\n- **Latency**: Listing all the files in S3 buckets every microbatch can be both slow and resource intensive.\r\n- **Costs**: Making List API requests to S3 every microbatch can be costly.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) which lets you find new files written to S3 bucket without the need to list all the files every microbatch.\r\n\r\nS3 buckets can be configured to send notification to an Amazon SQS Queue on Object Create / Object Delete events. For details see AWS documentation here [Configuring S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) \r\n\r\nSpark can leverage this to find new files written to S3 bucket by reading notifications from SQS queue instead of listing files every microbatch.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new SQSSource which uses Amazon SQS queue to find new files every microbatch.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n`val inputDf = spark\r\n.readStream\r\n.format(\"s3-sqs\")\r\n.schema(schema)\r\n.option(\"fileFormat\", \"json\")\r\n.option(\"sqsUrl\", \"https://QUEUE_URL\")\r\n.option(\"region\", \"us-east-1\")\r\n.load()`\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nWe create a scheduled thread which runs asynchronously with the streaming query thread and periodically fetches messages from the SQS Queue. Key information related to file path & timestamp is extracted from the SQS messages and the new files are stored in a thread safe SQS file cache.\r\n\r\nStreaming Query thread gets the files from SQS File Cache and filters out the new files. Based on the maxFilesPerTrigger condition, all or a part of the new files are added to the offset log and marked as processed in the SQS File Cache. The corresponding SQS messages for the processed files are deleted from the Amazon SQS Queue and the offset value is incremented and returned.\r\n\r\n![SQS Design (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43843989/59924375-3c842380-9453-11e9-9a4e-6f3fa6faf3fb.jpg)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests in SqsSourceOptionsSuite which test various SqsSourceOptions. Will add more tests after some initial feedback on design approach and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Kafka integration document](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html) `failOnDataLoss` has effect only on streaming queries. While I was implementing the DSv2 Kafka batch sources I've realized it's not true. This feature is covered in [KafkaDontFailOnDataLossSuite](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/54da3bbfb2c936827897c52ed6e5f0f428b98e9f/external/kafka-0-10-sql/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/KafkaDontFailOnDataLossSuite.scala#L180).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've updated the doc to reflect this behavior.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd docs/\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll build\r\n```\r\nManual webpage

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, pretty skipped message added by https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f7435bec6a9348cfbbe26b13c230c08545d16067 mechanism seems not working when xmlrunner is installed apparently.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two things:\r\n\r\n1. When `xmlrunner` is installed, seems `xmlrunner` does not respect `vervosity` level in unittests (default is level 1).\r\n\r\n    So the output looks as below\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Running tests...\r\n     ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    So it is not caught by our message detection mechanism.\r\n\r\n2. If we manually set the `vervocity` level to `xmlrunner`, it prints messages as below:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    test_mixed_udf (pyspark.sql.tests.test_pandas_udf_scalar.ScalarPandasUDFTests) ... SKIP (0.000s)\r\n    test_mixed_udf_and_sql (pyspark.sql.tests.test_pandas_udf_scalar.ScalarPandasUDFTests) ... SKIP (0.000s)\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This is different in our Jenkins machine:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    test_createDataFrame_column_name_encoding (pyspark.sql.tests.test_arrow.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'Pandas >= 0.23.2 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n    test_createDataFrame_does_not_modify_input (pyspark.sql.tests.test_arrow.ArrowTests) ... skipped 'Pandas >= 0.23.2 must be installed; however, it was not found.'\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Note that last `SKIP` is different. This PR fixes the regular expression to catch `SKIP` case as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting test(python2.7): pyspark....\r\nFinished test(python2.7): pyspark....

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen running FlatMapGroupsInPandasExec or AggregateInPandasExec the shuffle uses a default number of partitions of 200 in \"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\". If the data is small, e.g. in testing, many of the partitions will be empty but are treated just the same.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks the `mapPartitionsInternal` iterator to be non-empty before calling `ArrowPythonRunner` to start computation on the iterator.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Ran the following benchmarks a simple example where most partitions are empty:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame( \r\n     [(1, 1.0), (1, 2.0), (2, 3.0), (2, 5.0), (2, 10.0)], \r\n     (\"id\", \"v\"))\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"id long, v double\", PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef normalize(pdf):\r\n    v = pdf.v\r\n    return pdf.assign(v=(v - v.mean()) / v.std())\r\n\r\ndf.groupby(\"id\").apply(normalize).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nIn [4]: %timeit df.groupby(\"id\").apply(normalize).count()                                                                    \r\n1.58 s ± 62.8 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)             \r\n\r\nIn [5]: %timeit df.groupby(\"id\").apply(normalize).count()                                                                    \r\n1.52 s ± 29.5 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `mapChildren` method in the TreeNode class is commonly used across the whole Spark SQL codebase. In this method, there's a if statement that checks non-empty children. However, there's a cached lazy val `containsChild`, which can avoid unnecessary computation since `containsChild` is used in other methods and therefore constructed anyway.\r\n\r\nBenchmark showed that this optimization can improve the whole TPC-DS planning time by 6.8%. There is no regression on any TPC-DS query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.","created_at":"2019-06-20T22:48:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:27:21Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T02:50:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9977d2b27b2602e34c2bd93fdcf654c7a955e3e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/621ab6b583a180d738e82d0863fc436508d71ab7","head":{"label":"yeshengm:treenode-children","ref":"treenode-children","sha":"621ab6b583a180d738e82d0863fc436508d71ab7","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-13809 introduced a framework for state management for computing Streaming Aggregates. The default implementation was in-memory hashmap which was backed up in HDFS complaint file system at the end of every micro-batch. \r\n\r\nCurrent implementation suffers from Performance and Latency Issues. It uses Executor JVM memory to store the states. State store size is limited by the size of the executor memory. Also\r\nExecutor JVM memory is shared by state storage and other tasks operations. State storage size will impact the performance of task execution\r\n\r\nMoreover, GC pauses, executor failures, OOM issues are common when the size of state storage increases which increases overall latency of a micro-batch\r\n\r\nRocksDB is a storage engine with key/value interface based on levelDB. New writes are inserted into the memtable; when memtable fills up, it flushes the data on local storage. It supports both point lookups and range scans, and provides different types of ACID guarantees and is optimized for flash storage. \r\n\r\nIn this PR I have implemented Rocksdb based state storage for Structured streaming which will provide major performance improvements for stateful stream processing.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nCreation of new State (For batch x and partition Pi)\r\n\r\n- if Node(Pi, x) = Node(Pi, x-1) :  state is already loaded in rocksDb\r\n- Else if Node(Pi, x) = Node(Pi, x-2) :  update rocksDb state using downloaded Delta(Pi, X-1) \r\nOtherwise create new rocksDB store using checkpointed data (snapshot + delta)\r\n\r\nDuring Batch Execution\r\n\r\n- Open rocksdb in transactional mode\r\n- Commit the transaction, Upload delta file into checkpoint folder and Create a backup of current Db state in local storage on successful completion of the batch \r\n- abort the transaction on any error\r\n \r\nSnapshot creation (Maintenance task)\r\n\r\n- Create a tarball of last backed up DB state and upload it to the checkpoint folder\r\n\r\nA detailed presentation on the implementation can be found [here](https://www.slideshare.net/BalajiMohanam/rocks-db-state-store-in-structured-streaming/1) \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests which extend existing abstract class StateStoreSuiteBase. (There is one UT failure which is related to metrics reporting in UT framework. Looking at it)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-20T09:27:09Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T02:24:31Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T09:12:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f07c8a1e4c846f02fefb0a31e85fbce08c384e8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

It would be great to have a new configuration for Spark event log compression like `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` .\r\nThis PR adds this new configuration as an optional configuration. So, if `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` is not given, `spark.io.compression.codec` will be used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn a nutshell, it looks like the absence of ML / MLlib classes on the classpath causes code in KryoSerializer to throw and catch ClassNotFoundExceptions whenever instantiating a new serializer in newInstance(). This isn't a performance problem in production (since MLlib is on the classpath there) but it's a huge issue in tests and appears to account for an enormous amount of test time\r\n\r\nWe can address

Work in progress] \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the constraints of a union table could be turned empty if any subtable is turned into an empty local relation. The side effect is filter cannot be inferred correctly (by InferFiltersFromConstrains). \r\n\r\nThis PR updates how the constraints of a Union table is calculated. Basically, it skips a child if it is based on an empty local relation. \r\n \r\nWe may reproduce the issue with the following setup:\r\n1) Prepare two tables: \r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table1(id string, val string) USING PARQUET\");\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table2(id string, val string) USING PARQUET\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Create a union view on table1. \r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n     | CREATE VIEW partitioned_table_1 AS\r\n     | SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id = 'a'\r\n     | UNION ALL\r\n     | SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id = 'b'\r\n     | UNION ALL\r\n     | SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id = 'c'\r\n     | UNION ALL\r\n     | SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id NOT IN ('a','b','c')\r\n     | \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n 3) View the optimized plan of this SQL. The filter '[t2.id = 'a']' cannot be inferred. We can see that the constraints of the left table are empty. \r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM partitioned_table_1 t1, table2 t2 WHERE t1.id [t1.id] = t2.id [t2.id] AND t1.id [t1.id] = 'a'\").queryExecution.optimizedPlan\r\n\r\nres39: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan =\r\nJoin Inner, (id#0 = id#4)\r\n:- Union\r\n:  :- Filter (isnotnull(id#0) && (id#0 = a))\r\n:  :  +- Relation[id#0,val#1] parquet\r\n:  :- LocalRelation <empty>, [id#0, val#1]\r\n:  :- LocalRelation <empty>, [id#0, val#1]\r\n:  +- Filter ((isnotnull(id#0) && NOT id#0 IN (a,b,c)) && (id#0 = a))\r\n:     +- Relation[id#0,val#1] parquet\r\n+- Filter isnotnull(id#4)\r\n   +- Relation[id#4,val#5] parquet\r\n\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM partitioned_table_1 t1, table2 t2 WHERE t1.id [t1.id] = t2.id [t2.id] AND t1.id [t1.id] = 'a'\").queryExecution.optimizedPlan.children(0).constraints\r\nres40: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExpressionSet = Set()\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter applying the above fix, the constraints of the union table is not empty anymore and the filter should be inferred properly.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM partitioned_table_1 t1, table2 t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id AND t1.id = 'a' \").queryExecution.optimizedPlan\r\nres9: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan =\r\nJoin Inner, (id#0 = id#16)\r\n:- Union\r\n:  :- Filter (isnotnull(id#0) AND (id#0 = a))\r\n:  :  +- Relation[id#0,val#1] parquet\r\n:  :- LocalRelation <empty>, [id#0, val#1]\r\n:  :- LocalRelation <empty>, [id#0, val#1]\r\n:  +- Filter ((isnotnull(id#0) AND NOT id#0 IN (a,b,c)) AND (id#0 = a))\r\n:     +- Relation[id#0,val#1] parquet\r\n+- Filter ((id#16 = a) AND isnotnull(id#16))\r\n   +- Relation[id#16,val#17] parquet\r\n\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM partitioned_table_1 t1, table2 t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id AND t1.id = 'a' \").queryExecution.optimizedPlan.children(0).constraints\r\nres10: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExpressionSet = Set(isnotnull(id#0), (id#0 = a))\r\n\r\nscala>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n* Existing unit test.\r\n* Package the system and the run the same SQL via spark-shell to make sure the plan is evaluated in an expected way. \r\n* (May need to create more test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn #24068, @IvanVergiliev fixes the issue that OrcFilters.createBuilder has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented.\r\n\r\nComparing to the approach in #24068, I propose a simple solution for the issue:\r\n1. separate the logic of building a convertible filter tree and the actual SearchArgument builder, since the two procedures are different and their return types are different. Thus the new introduced class `ActionType`,`TrimUnconvertibleFilters` and `BuildSearchArgument`  in #24068 can be dropped. The code is more readable.\r\n2. For most of the leaf nodes, the convertible result is always Some(node), we can abstract it like this PR.\r\n3. The code is actually small changes on the previous code. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24783\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRun the benchmark provided in #24068:\r\n```\r\nval schema = StructType.fromDDL(\"col INT\")\r\n(20 to 30).foreach { width =>\r\n  val whereFilter = (1 to width).map(i => EqualTo(\"col\", i)).reduceLeft(Or)\r\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n  OrcFilters.createFilter(schema, Seq(whereFilter))\r\n  println(s\"With $width filters, conversion takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n```\r\nWith 20 filters, conversion takes 6 ms\r\nWith 21 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 22 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 23 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 24 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 25 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 26 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 27 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 28 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 29 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\nWith 30 filters, conversion takes 0 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso verified with Unit tests.","created_at":"2019-06-19T15:59:43Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T04:28:11Z","closed_at":"2019-06-24T04:28:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65ee125bf111ee906dd21e4f3340c90b45627344","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1792bb6dee912408ce3943e2f942e6cde34714ed","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:refactorOrcFilters","ref":"refactorOrcFilters","sha":"1792bb6dee912408ce3943e2f942e6cde34714ed","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nISSUE :  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28106\r\nWhen we use add jar in SQL, it will have three step:\r\n\r\n- add jar to HiveClient's classloader\r\n- HiveClientImpl.runHiveSQL(\"ADD JAR\" + PATH)\r\n- SessionStateBuilder.addJar\r\n\r\nThe second step seems has no impact to the whole process. Since event it failed, we still can execute.\r\nThe first step will add jar path to HiveClient's ClassLoader, then we can use the jar in HiveClientImpl\r\nThe Third Step will add this jar path to SparkContext. But expect local file path, it will call RpcServer's FileServer to add this to Env, the is you pass wrong path. it will cause error, but if you pass HDFS path or VIEWFS path, it won't check it and just add it to jar Path Map.\r\n\r\nThen when next TaskSetManager send out Task, this path will be brought by TaskDescription. Then Executor will call updateDependencies, this method will check all jar path and file path in TaskDescription. Then error happends like below:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/59817635-4a527f80-9353-11e9-9e08-9407b2b54023.png)\r\n  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a performance problem in environments where `lz4-java`'s native JNI libraries fail to initialize.\r\n\r\nSpark's uses `lz4-java` for LZ4 compression. Under the hood, the `LZ4BlockInputStream` and `LZ4BlockOutputStream` constructors call `LZ4Factory.fastestInstance()`, which attempts to load JNI libraries and falls back on Java implementations in case the JNI library cannot be loaded or initialized.\r\n\r\nIf the LZ4 JNI libraries are present on the library load path (`Native.isLoaded()`) but cannot be initialized (e.g. due to breakage caused by shading) then an exception will be thrown and caught, triggering fallback to `fastestJavaInstance()` (a non-JNI implementation).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the LZ4 library does not cache the fact that the JNI library failed during initialization, so every call to `LZ4Factory.fastestInstance()` re-attempts (and fails) to initialize the native code. These initialization attempts are performed in a `static synchronized` method, so exceptions from failures are thrown while holding shared monitors and this causes monitor-contention performance issues. Here's an example stack trace showing the problem:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\njava.lang.Throwable.fillInStackTrace(Native Method)\r\njava.lang.Throwable.fillInStackTrace(Throwable.java:783) => holding

and Spark ignored it with **not selected** message. In JDK8,  the modification time generated by this test case doesn't have `milliseconds` part.\r\n```\r\nGetting new files for time 1560896662000, ignoring files older than

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLOAD DATA command resolves the partition column name as case sensitive manner,\r\nwhere as in insert commandthe partition column name will be resolved using \r\nthe SQLConf resolver where the names will be resolved based on `spark.sql.caseSensitive` property. Same logic can be applied for resolving the partition column names in LOAD COMMAND.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's to handle the partition column name correctly according to the configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT and manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis proposes to improve Spark instrumentation by adding a hook for user-defined metrics, extending Spark’s Dropwizard/Codahale metrics system.\r\nThe original motivation of this work was to add instrumentation for S3 filesystem access metrics by Spark job. Currently, [[ExecutorSource]] instruments HDFS and local filesystem metrics. Rather than extending the code there, we proposes with this JIRA to add a metrics plugin system which is of more flexible and general use.\r\nContext: The Spark metrics system provides a large variety of metrics, see also , useful to  monitor and troubleshoot Spark workloads. A typical workflow is to sink the metrics to a storage system and build dashboards on top of that.  \r\nHighlights:\r\n-\tThe metric plugin system makes it easy to implement instrumentation for S3 access by Spark jobs.\r\n-\tThe metrics plugin system allows for easy extensions of how Spark collects HDFS-related workload metrics. This is currently done using the Hadoop Filesystem GetAllStatistics method, which is deprecated in recent versions of Hadoop. Recent versions of Hadoop Filesystem recommend using method GetGlobalStorageStatistics, which also provides several additional metrics. GetGlobalStorageStatistics is not available in Hadoop 2.7 (had been introduced in Hadoop 2.8). Using a metric plugin for Spark would allow an easy way to “opt in” using such new API calls for those deploying suitable Hadoop versions.\r\n-\tWe also have the use case of adding Hadoop filesystem monitoring for a custom Hadoop compliant filesystem in use in our organization (EOS using the XRootD protocol). The metrics plugin infrastructure makes this easy to do. Others may have similar use cases.\r\n-\tMore generally, this method makes it straightforward to plug in Filesystem and other metrics to the Spark monitoring system. Future work on plugin implementation can address extending monitoring to measure usage of external resources (OS, filesystem, network, accelerator cards, etc), that maybe would not normally be considered general enough for inclusion in Apache Spark code, but that can be nevertheless useful for specialized use cases, tests or troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe proposed implementation extends and modifies the work on Executor Plugin of SPARK-24918. Additionally, this is related to recent work on extending Spark executor metrics, such as SPARK-25228.\r\nAs discussed during the review, the implementaiton of this feature modifies the @Developer API for Executor Plugins, such that the new version is incompatible with the original version in Spark 2.4. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis modifies existing tests for ExecutorPluginSuite to adapt them to the API changes. In addition, the new funtionality for registering pluginMetrics has been manually tested running Spark on YARN and K8S clusters, in particular for monitoring S3 and for extending HDFS instrumentation with the Hadoop Filesystem “GetGlobalStorageStatistics” metrics.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add **Single threading model design (pinned thread model)** mode which is an experimental mode to sync threads on PVM and JVM. See https://www.py4j.org/advanced_topics.html#using-single-threading-model-pinned-thread\r\n\r\n### Multi threading model\r\n\r\nCurrently, PySpark uses this model. Threads on PVM and JVM are independent. For instance, in a different Python thread, callbacks are received and relevant Python codes are executed. JVM threads are reused when possible.\r\n\r\nPy4J will create a new thread every time a command is received and there is no thread available. See the current model we're using - https://www.py4j.org/advanced_topics.html#the-multi-threading-model\r\n\r\nOne problem in this model is that we can't sync threads on PVM and JVM out of the box. This leads to some problems in particular at some codes related to threading in JVM side. See:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7056e004ee566fabbb9b22ddee2de55ef03260db/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L334\r\nDue to reusing JVM threads, seems the job groups in Python threads cannot be set in each thread as described in the JIRA.\r\n\r\n### Single threading model design (pinned thread model)\r\n\r\nThis mode pins and syncs the threads on PVM and JVM to work around the problem above. For instance, in the same Python thread, callbacks are received and relevant Python codes are executed. See https://www.py4j.org/advanced_topics.html#the-single-threading-model\r\n\r\nEven though this mode can sync threads on PVM and JVM for other thread related code paths,\r\n this might cause another problem: seems unable to inherit properties as below (assuming multi-thread mode still creates new threads when existing threads are busy, I suspect this issue already exists when multiple jobs are submitted in multi-thread mode; however, it can be always seen in single threading mode):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD=true ./bin/pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport threading\r\n\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"a\", \"hi\")\r\ndef print_prop():\r\n    print(spark.sparkContext.getLocalProperty(\"a\"))\r\n\r\nthreading.Thread(target=print_prop).start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnlike Scala side:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"a\", \"hi\")\r\nnew Thread(new Runnable {\r\n  def run() = println(spark.sparkContext.getLocalProperty(\"a\"))\r\n}).start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nhi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behaviour potentially could cause weird issues but this PR currently does not target this fix this for now since this mode is experimental.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix?\r\n\r\nBasically there are two types of Py4J servers `GatewayServer` and `ClientServer`.  The former is for multi threading and the latter is for single threading. This PR adds a switch to use the latter.\r\n\r\nIn Scala side:\r\nThe logic to select a server is encapsulated in `Py4JServer` and use `Py4JServer` at `PythonRunner` for Spark summit and `PythonGatewayServer` for Spark shell. Each uses `ClientServer` when `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` is `true` and `GatewayServer` otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn Python side:\r\nSimply do an if-else to switch the server to talk. It uses `ClientServer` when `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` is `true` and `GatewayServer` otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis is disabled by default for now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. This can be tested via:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPYSPARK_PIN_THREAD=true ./bin/pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\nand/or\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python --testnames \"pyspark.tests.test_pin_thread\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, ran the Jenkins tests with `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` enabled.","created_at":"2019-06-18T04:21:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:44Z","closed_at":"2019-11-07T21:45:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a4166efc0cebfc9cb5481dd1f23c3a5d7315532","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e2d83277635b02cc03f35502294892dc7d8a3d2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:pinned-thread","ref":"pinned-thread","sha":"9e2d83277635b02cc03f35502294892dc7d8a3d2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, pandas_udf supports \"grouped aggregate\" type that can be used with unbounded and unbounded windows. There is another set of use cases that can benefit from a \"grouped transform\" type pandas_udf.\r\n\r\nGrouped transform is defined as a N -> N mapping over a group. For example, \"compute zscore for values in the group using the grouped mean and grouped stdev\", or \"rank the values in the group\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, in order to do this, user needs to use \"grouped apply\", for example:\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(schema, GROUPED_MAP)\r\ndef subtract_mean(pdf)\r\n    v = pdf['v']\r\n    pdf['v'] = v - v.mean()\r\n    return pdf\r\n\r\ndf.groupby('id').apply(subtract_mean)\r\n# +---+----+\r\n# | id|   v|\r\n# +---+----+\r\n# |  1|-0.5|\r\n# |  1| 0.5|\r\n# |  2|-3.0|\r\n# |  2|-1.0|\r\n# |  2| 4.0|\r\n# +---+----+\r\n```\r\nThis approach has a few downside:\r\n\r\nSpecifying the full return schema is complicated for the user although the function only changes one column.\r\n* The column name 'v' inside as part of the udf, makes the udf less reusable.\r\n* The entire dataframe is serialized to pass to Python although only one column is needed.\r\n* Here we propose a new type of pandas_udf to work with these types of use cases:\r\n\r\nHere we propose a new type of pandas_udf to work with these types of use cases:\r\n```\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    [(1, 1.0), (1, 2.0), (2, 3.0), (2, 5.0), (2, 10.0)],\r\n    (\"id\", \"v\"))\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf('double', GROUPED_XFORM)\r\ndef subtract_mean(v):\r\n    return v - v.mean()\r\n\r\nw = Window.partitionBy('id')\r\n\r\ndf = df.withColumn('v', subtract_mean(df['v']).over(w))\r\n# +---+----+\r\n# | id|   v|\r\n# +---+----+\r\n# |  1|-0.5|\r\n# |  1| 0.5|\r\n# |  2|-3.0|\r\n# |  2|-1.0|\r\n# |  2| 4.0|\r\n# +---+----+\r\n```\r\nWhich addresses the above downsides.\r\n\r\n* The user only needs to specify the output type of a single column.\r\n* The column being zscored is decoupled from the udf implementation\r\n* We only need to send one column to Python worker and concat the result with the original dataframe (this is what grouped aggregate is doing already)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to groupby transform in pandas, hence the name \"grouped transform\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'id': [1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 'value': [1., 2., 3., 5., 10.]})\r\n\r\n>>> df\r\n   id  value\r\n\r\n0   1    1.0\r\n1   1    2.0\r\n2   2    3.0\r\n3   2    5.0\r\n4   2   10.0\r\n\r\n>>> df['value_demean'] = df.groupby('id')['value'].transform(lambda x: x - x.mean())\r\n>>> df\r\n\r\n   id  value

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using `DROPMALFORMED` mode, corrupted records aren't dropped if malformed columns aren't read. This behavior is due to CSV parser column pruning. Current doc of `DROPMALFORMED` doesn't mention the effect of column pruning. Users will be confused by the fact that `DROPMALFORMED` mode doesn't work as expected.\r\n\r\nColumn pruning also affects other modes. This is a doc improvement to add a note to doc of `mode` to explain it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A.

the newly added shuffle block fetching protocol in #24565, we can keep this work by extending the FetchShuffleBlocks message.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up work for #22112's future improvment[1]: `Currently we can't rollback and rerun a shuffle map stage, and just fail.`\r\n\r\nSpark will rerun a finished shuffle write stage while meeting fetch failures, currently, the rerun shuffle map stage will only resubmit the task for missing partitions and reuse the output of other partitions. This logic is fine in most scenarios, but for indeterministic operations(like repartition), multiple shuffle write attempts may write different data, only rerun the missing partition will lead a correctness bug. So for the shuffle map stage of indeterministic operations, we need to support rolling back the shuffle map stage and re-generate the shuffle files. In this patch, we achieve this by adding the indeterministic tag in the stage, for the indeterministic stage, when the stage resubmits, we'll clear all existing map status and rerun all partitions. We also add properties in task LocalProperties to record the message for the retried indeterminate stage, so that the shuffle file which generated from retried indeterministic stage will keep the shuffle generation id in the file name. The corresponding reduce side will specify which shuffle generation id of shuffle it wants to read. The shuffle generation id marked the retried times of this stage, so we reuse the stage attempt id as the shuffle generation id while meeting the indeterminate stage reran.\r\n\r\nAll changes are summarized as follows:\r\n- Extend FetchShuffleBlock message with shuffleGenerationId.\r\n- Add corresponding support for ShuffleBlockResolver, if the shuffle file generated from the indeterminate stage, its name will contain the indeterminateAttemptId, otherwise the file name just as before.\r\n- Add the retried indeterminate stage info in TaskContext.localProperties and use it in Shuffle Reader and Writer.\r\n- Add the determinate flag in Stage and use it in DAGScheduler and the cleaning work for the intermediate stage.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- UT: Add UT for all changing code and newly added function.\r\n- Manual Test: Also providing a manual test to verify the effect.\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval determinateStage0 = sc.parallelize(0 until 1000 * 1000 * 100, 10)\r\nval indeterminateStage1 = determinateStage0.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage2 = indeterminateStage1.repartition(200)\r\nval indeterminateStage3 = indeterminateStage2.repartition(100)\r\nval indeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage3.repartition(300)\r\nval fetchFailIndeterminateStage4 = indeterminateStage4.map { x =>\r\nif (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId == 190 && \r\n  TaskContext.get.stageAttemptNumber == 0) {\r\n  throw new Exception(\"pkill -f -n java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nval indeterminateStage5 = fetchFailIndeterminateStage4.repartition(200)\r\nval finalStage6 = indeterminateStage5.repartition(100).collect().distinct.length\r\n``` \r\nIt's a simple job with multi indeterminate stage, it will get a wrong answer while using old Spark version like 2.2/2.3, and will be killed after #22112. With this fix, the job can retry all indeterminate stage as below screenshot and get the right result.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4833765/54444941-c058b080-477e-11e9-8bad-bea13ed21b9e.png)","created_at":"2019-06-17T14:25:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T12:59:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-23T08:20:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"534f3398322baede8c1ca83ffc8f6f9474d7904c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith JDK9+, the generate **bytecode** of `FromUnixTime` raise `java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError` due to [JDK-8145148](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8145148) . This is a blocker in [Apache Spark JDK11 Jenkins job](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7-jdk-11-ubuntu-testing/). Locally, this is reproducible by the following unit test suite with JDK9+.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"catalyst/testOnly *.DateExpressionsSuite\"\r\n...\r\n[info] org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DateExpressionsSuite *** ABORTED *** (23 seconds, 75 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Method org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.TimestampFormatter.apply(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/time/ZoneId;Ljava/util/Locale;)Lorg/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/TimestampFormatter; must be InterfaceMeth\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bytecode issue is generated by `Janino` , so we replace `.apply` to `.MODULE$$.apply` and adds test coverage for similar codes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually with the existing UTs by doing the following with JDK9+.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"catalyst/testOnly *.DateExpressionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, this is the last JDK11 error in `catalyst` module. So, we can verify with the following, too.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"project catalyst\" test\r\n...\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 3552\r\n[info] Suites: completed 210, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we use upper case partition name in Hive table, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE src (KEY STRING, VALUE STRING) PARTITIONED BY (DS STRING)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, `insert into table` query doesn't work\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE src PARTITION(ds) SELECT 'k' key, 'v' value, '1' ds\r\n// or\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE src PARTITION(DS) SELECT 'k' KEY, 'v' VALUE, '1' DS\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table.ValidationFailureSemanticException: Partition spec {ds=, DS=1} contains non-partition columns;  \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs Hive metastore is not case preserving and keeps partition columns with lower cased names, we lowercase column names in partition spec before passing to Hive client. But we write upper case column names in partition paths.\r\n\r\nHowever, when calling `loadDynamicPartitions` to do `insert into table` for dynamic partition, Hive calculates full path spec for partition paths. So it calculates a partition spec like `{ds=, DS=1}` in above case and fails partition column validation. This patch is proposed to fix the issue by lowercasing the column names in written partition paths for Hive partitioned table.\r\n\r\nThis fix touchs `saveAsHiveFile` method, which is used in `InsertIntoHiveDirCommand` and `InsertIntoHiveTable` commands. Among them, only `InsertIntoHiveTable` passes `partitionAttributes` parameter. So I think this change only affects `InsertIntoHiveTable` command.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`glue`-class string can be properly used in `sql` (it's really just a `character`)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`glue` package creates decorated `character` objects:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# from ?glue::glue\r\nname <- \"Fred\"\r\nage <- 50\r\nanniversary <- as.Date(\"1991-10-12\")\r\nglue_obj = glue('My name is {name},',\r\n  'my age next year is {age + 1},',\r\n  'my anniversary is {format(anniversary, \"%A, %B %d, %Y\")}.')\r\ndput(glue_obj)\r\n# structure(\"My name is Fred,my age next year is 51,my anniversary is Saturday, October 12, 1991.\", class = c(\"glue\", \"character\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e., it's just `character` with an extra `class`.\r\n\r\n`writeObject` and `getSerdeType` both rely on the first class of the input: `type <- class(object)[[1L]]`. Hence for `glue` objects, `type` will be `'glue'`.\r\n\r\nThen the `switch` statement will e.g. work like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch('glue',\r\n         NULL = writeVoid(con),\r\n         integer = writeInt(con, object),\r\n         glue = , # nolint\r\n         character = 'matched to character')\r\n# [1] \"matched to character\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWIP PR at #24888 will provide a much more general fix to the `glue`-specific problem solved in this PR, but as noted in the comments, `glue` is a pretty common package so this is likely to serve most related issues with a much simpler fix.","created_at":"2019-06-16T14:31:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T18:15:57Z","closed_at":"2019-12-29T00:05:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d092b074b33a33d5355ce0c58b098afc688fc93a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARKR","name":"SPARKR","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba908171073a165ec54980fae2b38a529149d4f0","head":{"label":"MichaelChirico:sql_glue","ref":"sql_glue","sha":"ba908171073a165ec54980fae2b38a529149d4f0","user":{"login":"MichaelChirico","id":7606389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDYzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelChirico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146693977,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY2OTM5Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"MichaelChirico/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MichaelChirico","id":7606389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDYzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7606389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelChirico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MichaelChirico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MichaelChirico/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUTF8String.trim() allocates a new object even if the string has no whitespace, when it can just return itself. A simple check for this case makes the method about 3x faster in the common case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nA rough benchmark of 90% strings without whitespace (at ends), and 10% that do have whitespace, suggests the average runtime goes from 20 ns to 6

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nModifies the HuberAggregator class so that a copy of the coefficients vector isn't created every time that an instance is added. Follows the approach of LeastSquaresAggregator and uses transient lazy class variable to store the reused quantities. (See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14109 for explanation of the use of transient lazy variables)\r\n\r\nOn the test case in the linked JIRA, this change gives an order of magnitude performance improvement reducing the time taken to fit the model from 540 to 47 seconds.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28062 for results from running a benchmark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe original `references` and `validConstraints` implementations in a few `QueryPlan` and `Expression` classes are methods, which means unnecessary re-computation can happen at times. This PR resolves this problem by making these method `lazy val`s.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the following chart, the planning time(without cost-based optimization) was dramatically reduced after this optimization. \r\n- The average planning time of TPC-DS queries was reduced by 19.63%.\r\n- The planning time of the most time-consuming TPC-DS query (q64) was reduced by 43.03%.\r\n- The running time for rule-based reordering joins(not cost-based join reordering) optimization, which are common in real-world OLAP queries,  was largely reduced.\r\n\r\n![chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12269969/59721493-536a1200-91d6-11e9-9bfb-d7cb1e841a86.png)\r\n\r\nDetailed stats are listed in the following spreadsheet (we warmed up the queries 5 iterations and then took average of the next 5 iterations).\r\n[Lazy val benchmark.xlsx](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/3303530/Lazy.val.benchmark.xlsx)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nShuffleMapTask's partition field is a FilePartition and FilePartition's 'files' field is a Stream$cons which is essentially a linked list. It is therefore serialized recursively.\r\nIf the number of files in each partition is, say, 10000 files, recursing into a linked list of length 10000 overflows the stack\r\n\r\nThe problem is only in Bucketed partitions. The corresponding implementation for non Bucketed partitions uses a StreamBuffer. The proposed change applies the same for Bucketed partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests. Added new unit test. The unit test fails without the patch. Manual testing on dataset used to reproduce the problem.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-13T18:53:58Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T17:15:01Z","closed_at":"2019-06-23T07:51:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ef56d72bb24062bec771b50397f9ecf1347e6cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24865/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24865/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24865/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1cd73c375da4a72822ea3355170fd4af6ff622c5","head":{"label":"parthchandra:SPARK-27100","ref":"SPARK-27100","sha":"1cd73c375da4a72822ea3355170fd4af6ff622c5","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187921479,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5MjE0Nzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"parthchandra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra/spark","description":"Apache

https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_12_BETA2/src/test/regress/expected/with.out\r\n\r\nWhen porting the test cases, found 7 PostgreSQL specific features that do not exist in Spark SQL:\r\n\r\n- [SPARK-19799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19799) Support WITH clause in subqueries\r\n- [SPARK-24497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24497) Support recursive SQL query\r\n- [SPARK-28297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28297) Handling outer links in CTE subquery expressions\r\n- [SPARK-28296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28296) Improved VALUES support\r\n- [SPARK-28146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28146) Support IS OF type predicate\r\n- [SPARK-28147](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28147) Support RETURNING clause\r\n- [SPARK-27878](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27878) Support ARRAY(sub-SELECT) expressions\r\n\r\nAlso, found one inconsistent behavior:\r\n- [SPARK-28299](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28299) Evaluation of multiple CTE uses\r\n\r\nAlso, added the following notes:\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support DELETE statement\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support UPDATE statement\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support RULEs\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support UNIQUE constraints\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support ON CONFLICT clause\r\n- Spark SQL doesn't support

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nContinue the work from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24821. Refactor resource handling code to make the code more readable. Major changes:\r\n\r\n* Moved resource-related classes to `spark.resource` from `spark`.\r\n* Added ResourceUtils and helper classes so we don't need to directly deal with Spark conf.\r\n * ResourceID: resource identifier and it provides conf keys\r\n * ResourceRequest/Allocation: abstraction for requested and allocated resources\r\n* Added `TestResourceIDs` to reference commonly used resource IDs in tests like `spark.executor.resource.gpu`.\r\n\r\ncc: @tgravescs @jiangxb1987 @Ngone51 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests for added utils and existing unit

The window spec is also not for the window function used there.\r\n\r\nWe should either remove the doctest, or improve it.\r\n\r\nBecause other functions of `Column` have doctest generally, so this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark only allows upcasting DecimalType to IntegralType or DecimalType.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes: if the target DecimalType is tighter than DoubleType or FloatType, we can upcast it as well.\r\nThe upcasting matters because it blocks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24806. E.g, if there is a table \"t\" with only one column of double type, \r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE t SELECT 10.0\r\n```\r\nThe data type of value 10.0 is DecimalType(3, 1). In the current code, Spark can't upcast the decimal to the column of double type.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL doesn't have `TINYINT`, which would map directly, but `SMALLINT`s are sufficient for uni-directional translation.\r\n\r\nA side-effect of this fix is that `AggregatedDialect` is now usable with multiple dialects targeting `jdbc:postgresql`, as `PostgresDialect.getJDBCType` no longer throws (for which reason backporting this fix would be lovely):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1217996f1574f758d8cccc1c4e3846452d24b35b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/jdbc/AggregatedDialect.scala#L42\r\n\r\n`dialects.flatMap` currently throws on the first attempt to get a JDBC type preventing subsequent dialects in the chain from providing an alternative.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit
