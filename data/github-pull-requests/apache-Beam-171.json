In this PR we replace these calls with invocation of parent constructor (DoFn, or PTransform). Strictly speaking, it is not the same as invoking `super()`, since super delegates the calls to next class parent in `__mro__` chain, however this change would make it easier for users to experiment and try Beam examples on Python 3 until BEAM-6158 is addressed, and in simple class hierarchies it results in the same behavior. \r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

So I added a note with that warning and the best version to use.\r\n\r\nOnly worry is that the note will become outdated if we ever update the golock file or switch to modules, but I can't think of a more \"evergreen\" way to leave a warning.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Both `Coder<WindowedValue<T>>` and `FnDataReceiver<WindowedValue<T>>` use `WindowedValue` as the data structure that both sides of Runner and SDK Harness know each other. Control Plane/Data Plane/State Plane/Logging is a highly abstraction, such as Control Plane and Logging, these are common requirements for all multi-language platforms. For example, the Flink community is also discussing how to support Python UDF, as well as how to deal with docker environment. how to data transfer, how to state access, how to logging etc. If Beam can further abstract these service interfaces, i.e., interface definitions are compatible with multiple engines, and finally provided to other projects in the form of class libraries, it definitely will help other platforms that want to support multiple languages. Take the FnDataService#receive interface as an example, and turn `WindowedValue<T>` into `T` so that other platforms can be extended arbitrarily, as follows:\r\n```\r\n<T> InboundDataClient receive(LogicalEndpoint inputLocation, Coder<T> coder, FnDataReceiver<T>> listener);\r\n```\r\nFor details of the discussion can be found in here:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@beam.apache.org:lte=1M:%5BDISCUSS%5D%20Turn%20%60WindowedValue\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PTransform IOs that cross SDK Harness border we create two PCollections: one lives outside SDK harness, one inside. As a result counters for these PCollections are counted inside Java DF worker as well as in SDK Harness. This causes us to double count them in Streaming jobs. This worked fine in Batch jobs since DFE will do deduplication work for us.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Adds a `typeDescriptor` parameter to SchemaCoder, and plumbs through a descriptor everywhere instances are created (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9493/commits/3bafcb0f6ccebd7534789f6247e50c247ceccb2c).\r\n- Modifies `GetterBasedSchemaProvider` so that the toRow/fromRow functions it creates have a meaningful equals and hashCode function (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9493/commits/d41579541c4fe1337a8f53386162e60b705df60d).\r\n- Adds an `equals` function to SchemaCoder that checks schema, typeDescriptor, fromRow, and toRow.\r\n- Adds some tests for the above features\r\n  - Each sub-class of `GetterBasedSchemaProvider` has at least one test checking that toRow and fromRow are equal after serialization (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9493/commits/36a601473b0b83ef4270c584798d4a1130fd6e24).\r\n  - Adds `SchemaCoderTest` which checks some instances of `SchemaCoder` with `CoderProperties.{coderSerializable, coderConsistentWithEquals}` (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9493/commits/ab18bd5c202fcb1b3c4d72cd186f28268bd6e4ce).\r\n- This change resolves BEAM-8204 and BEAM-8205, so the PR also re-enables `AvroSchemaTest.testAvroPipelineGroupBy` for Flink and Apex (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9493/commits/17c264602cd5917f7e7b68ee178bcafad3655f2e).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

don't know how to specify individual tests using gradle, and as a python developer, it's way too opaque for me to figure out on my own.  \r\n\r\nThe developer wiki suggest calling the tests directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py nosetests --tests <module>:<test class>.<test method>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this defeats the purpose of using tox, which is there to help users manage the myriad virtual envs required to run the different tests.  Luckily, there is an easier way. \r\n\r\nWith this PR you can now do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntox -e py27 -- --tests apache_beam.testing.synthetic_pipeline_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

\"semi_persist_dir\" is not configurable. This may become a problem in certain scenarios. For example, the default value of \"semi_persist_dir\" is \"/tmp\" (https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/container/boot.go#L48) in Python SDK harness. When the environment type is \"PROCESS\", the disk of \"/tmp\" may be filled up and unexpected issues will occur in production environment. \r\n\r\nSo, This pull request makes the semi_persist_dir configurable through adding a new PipelineOption(RemoteEnvironmentOptions).The Pipeline option will be passed to the `DefaultJobBundleFactory` and then be used in each EnvironmentFactory(docker, process, external and embedded).\r\n\r\nFor details of the discussion can be found in [1].\r\n\r\n[1]

a `@RunWith(Enclosed.class)` to `CloudObjectsTest` so that `DefaultCoders` actually runs. Since this test hasn't been running it has a few issues, which I've also attempted to resolve here. A summary of the changes to that end:\r\n- When testing a `StructuredCoder` sub-class use the components list as the expected components, rather than the usual arguments list.\r\n- Add `DoubleCoder` to list of Dataflow known coders.\r\n- Now only validates that Dataflow known coders don't have a `PIPELINE_PROTO_CODER_ID` rather than _all_ model coders.\r\n- Add equals and hashCode for SchemaCoder and RowCoder so that they can be compared. Currently just compares the underlying schema and `fromRow`, `toRow`, so it doesn't work as expected for instances created with lambdas.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a test case that would have caught

key `library.java.byte_buddy`.  However, the code later in the module now forces this version during resolution (although only at runtime?  I had some odd gradle reports that suggested it _wasn't_ enforced.)\r\n\r\nFor test artifacts, Mockito 3.0.0 merged last week depends on 1.9.7+\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the mailing list, we discussed simplifying the current cache token design to\r\nallow for a simpler asynchronous implementation on the SDK side. The old design\r\ntransferred valid cache tokens in ProcessBundleRequests which were previously\r\nassigned in get/put/clear state requests.\r\n\r\nThe new proposal drops the cache token assignment in get/put/clear requests in\r\nfavor of a predefined cache token list for all user state and each side\r\ninput. These cache tokens are valid for the entire bundle and do not change. The\r\nRunner needs to take care to generate new user state cache tokens in case of a\r\nfailure and to properly update the side input cache tokens when the side input\r\ngets updated.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

far as I can tell Python does not care about boundedness of PCollections even in streaming mode, but external transforms _do_.  In my ongoing effort to get PubsubIO external transforms working I discovered that I could not generate an unbounded write using the expansion service from python: it always came back as a _bounded_ write. \r\n\r\nMy pipeline looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(\r\npipe\r\n  | external.pubsub.ReadFromPubSub(subscription=subscription, with_attributes=True)\r\n  | external.pubsub.WriteToPubSub(topic=OUTPUT_TOPIC, with_attributes=True)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PCollections returned from the external Read are Unbounded, as expected, but python is responsible for creating the intermediate PCollection, which is always Bounded, and thus external Write generated by Java is always Bounded. \r\n\r\nIf I'm on the right track here I'll make some tests.  I've manually tested it enough to confirm that it gets my external xform tests working.  \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

need a way to mark WindowedValue as a retraction. Current idea is we should separate sub-classes of WindowedValue without and with retraction flag to reduce the impact of enabling retractions. It is mostly because I plan to use Boolean as the flag of retraction so each instance of WindowedValue will have 8 bytes overhead if we don't have such a separation.\r\n\r\nIn the future, as the implementation of retraction work goes, I will probably add more sub-classes of WindowedValue which implements isRetraction(), and those will be used for retracting mode. Hopefully by doing so, we can limit the overhead of message metadata change on pipelines that enables retraction only. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

caches user state in the Python SDK using a LRU cache with a bounded number\r\nof items. Cache entries are guarded by cache tokens which are supplied by the\r\nRunner in every ProcessBundleRequest. Cache entries are stored throughout\r\nbundles and are evicted either by the least-recently-used strategy or when a new\r\ncache entry for the same state key is stored.\r\n\r\nThe caching layer sits in front of the state retrieval layer which means that\r\nrequests are going to the cache first, if a valid cache token exists and the\r\ncache contains an entry for a state key. Upon first reading state for a given\r\nstate key, the caching layer materializes the state and stores it in the\r\ncache.\r\n\r\nWith the recent changes to the cache token handling in the Proto, append or\r\nclear requests are executed non-blocking because the cache tokens provided for a\r\nbundle remain valid for the life time of a bundle.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
