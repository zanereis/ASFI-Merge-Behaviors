Next to that, the backfills were non deterministic\r\ndue to the random execution of tasks, causing root tasks\r\nbeing added to the non ready list too soon.\r\n\r\nThis updates the backfill logic as

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-897\r\n\r\nIn 1.7.1, all root tasks must have failed in order for a dagrun to fail, in 1.8.0 a single root task failure will fail a dagrun and prevent all other tasks in the DAG from running which is not logical behavior and a regression from 1.7.1. This PR makes the logic sane again and makes airflow behave in the same way it did in 1.7.1.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Running in airbnb production, I will add a regression test post-hoc in the interests of getting the next RC ready.\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin @criccomini @artwr @saguziel @mistercrunch

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-880\r\n\r\nThere are two major problems with remote logs in Airflow right now:\r\n1. Lack of Complete Logs: Remote logs should be the default instead of the log that is only loaded if the local log is not present, because the remote log will have the logs for all of the tries of a task, whereas the local log is only guaranteed to have the most recent one\r\n2. Lack of Consistency: The logs returned will always be the same from all the webservers (right now different logs can be returned if a webserver has a log vs doesn't, and there can be different logs between webservers that have the log).\r\nRight now log functionality is not consistent when it comes to remote logs.\r\n \r\nThis PR addresses these issues by ALWAYS reading from remote logs and then also reading logs from worker hosts if the task is already running (to get in-flight logs). The one issue with this PR is that if a task is running on a worker it already ran on, then you will get duplicate logs for all of the previous runs of the task that already completed (delimited by something like \"*** Getting remote logs\" \"*** Getting logs on local worker\"). This can be fixed later (either by streaming logs to the log server or by creating a proper abstraction for multiple task instance runs), and is still better than the current behavior (duplicate info

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- AIRFLOW-869\r\n\r\nMark success was buggy and was directly creating and changing task instances, without considering dag runs. This patch removes direct database access from views.py and puts it in the API, making it ready for future use.  \r\n\r\n* The recursive has been removed. It made no sense in my opinion. SubDags and their tasks are always considered. \r\n* It is dependent on existing dag runs. You cannot add a task instance somewhere in the middle of no-where.\r\n* It will create dag runs for subdags to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\n@aoen @r39132 @toddychen please provide feedback, the functionality itself should be working and testable in a local dev

Distributed](https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) subproject makes it incredibly easy to create clusters of Python workers.

This Executor allows Airflow to execute tasks in a Dask cluster.\r\n\r\nTo quickly get started with a cluster, see the [instructions in the Airflow configuration docs.](https://github.com/jlowin/airflow/blob/0e0cd7e006073137a4bd379f857c68abada435ee/docs/configuration.rst#scaling-out-with-dask)\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Added unit tests to backfill example dags

info.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-06T16:16:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-13T22:04:46Z","closed_at":"2017-03-13T22:04:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"433662082d7208fc67d6ad6dfcd1ad273a68cb19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3eb44c74b0f15e1b93b5f779b4e551c1aca10b2b","head":{"label":"dhuang:AIRFLOW-770","ref":"AIRFLOW-770","sha":"3eb44c74b0f15e1b93b5f779b4e551c1aca10b2b","user":{"login":"dhuang","id":1597448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1597448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80047105,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDA0NzEwNQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"dhuang/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhuang","id":1597448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc0NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1597448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhuang/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-825 \r\n\r\n**Testing Done:**\r\n- Unit tests for Dataflow object\r\n- Contrib unit tests for FileDataflow (contrib)\r\n- local testing for GCSDataflow (contrib)\r\n\r\n**Example use:**\r\nThe upstream task, `data_generator`, returns a tuple of three objects.\r\nThe downstream task, `python_dataflow`, defines a two dataflows from the upstream task. The first is called `all_data` and receives the whole output of the data generator; the second is called `some_data` and only receives the 1st element. These two arguments are passed as keyword functions to the python callable, as well as the Operator context (for use in non-PythonOperators).\r\n\r\nDataflows use XComs by default but are easily extended to use alternative storage. I have included a filesystem-backed Dataflow and a Google Cloud Storage-backed Dataflow in the contrib folder; the filesystem one includes unit tests.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    data_generator = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id='data_generator',\r\n        python_callable=lambda: ('string', [1, 2, 3], {'a': 'b'}))\r\n\r\n    def dataflow_fn(all_data, some_data, **context):\r\n        logging.info('here is all the data: {}'.format(all_data))\r\n        logging.info('here is just some of the some_data: {}'.format(some_data))\r\n        logging.info('and here is the raw data in the context: {}'.format(\r\n            context['dataflows']))\r\n\r\n    python_dataflow = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id='python_dataflow',\r\n        python_callable=dataflow_fn,\r\n        provide_context=True,\r\n        dataflows=dict(\r\n            all_data=Dataflow(data_generator),\r\n            some_data=Dataflow(data_generator, index=1)))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Summary (from JIRA):**\r\n\r\nFollowing discussion on the dev list, this adds first-class Dataflow semantics\r\nto Airflow.\r\n\r\nA Dataflow object represents the result of an upstream task. If the upstream\r\ntask has multiple outputs contained in a tuple, dict, or other indexable form,\r\nan index may be provided so the Dataflow only uses the appropriate output.\r\n\r\nDataflows are passed to downstream tasks with a key. This has two effects:\r\n    1. It sets up a dependency between the upstream and downstream tasks to\r\n       ensure that the downstream task does not run before the upstream result\r\n       is available.\r\n    2. It ensures that the [indexed] upstream result is available in the\r\n       downstream task's context as ``context['dataflows'][key]``. In addition,\r\n       the result will be passed directly to PythonOperators as a keyword\r\n       argument.\r\n\r\nDataflows use the XCom mechanism to exchange data. Data is passed through the\r\nfollowing series of steps:\r\n    1. After the upstream task runs, data is passed to the Dataflow object's\r\n       _set_data() method.\r\n    2. The Dataflow's serialize() method is called on the data. This method\r\n       takes the data object and returns a representation that can be used to\r\n       reconstruct it later.\r\n    3. _set_data() stores the serialized result as an XCom.\r\n    4. Before the downstream task runs, it calls the Dataflow _get_data()\r\n       method.\r\n    5. _get_data() retrieves the upstream XCom.\r\n    6. The Dataflow's deserialize() method is called. This method takes the\r\n       serialiezd representation and returns the data object.\r\n    7. The data object is passed to the downstream task.\r\n\r\nThe basic Dataflow object has identity serialize and deserialize methods,\r\nmeaning data is stored directly in the Airflow database. Therefore, for\r\nperformance and practical reasons, basic Dataflows should not be used with large\r\nor complex results.\r\n\r\nDataflows can easily be extended to use remote storage. In this case, the\r\nserialize method should write the data in to storage and return a URI, which\r\nwill be stored as an XCom. The URI will be passed to deserialize() so that the\r\ndata can be downloaded and reconstructed.","created_at":"2017-02-01T20:30:48Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T02:24:22Z","closed_at":"2017-03-16T02:24:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69d0846f8cf6b2b7490cbe4f4a99c2ac0172be4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/55d6a71504b255e19fe6d06599332c22f56a5ea4","head":{"label":"jlowin:dataflow","ref":"dataflow","sha":"55d6a71504b255e19fe6d06599332c22f56a5ea4","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

view for subdag has not been working. I do not think we are able\r\ncleanly figure out where the code for the factory method lives when we\r\nprocess the dags, so we need to save the location when the subdag is\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nPreviously for a subdag, its `fileloc` attribute would be set to the\r\nlocation of the parent dag. I think it is appropriate to instead set\r\nit to the actual child dag location instead. We do not lose any\r\ninformation this way (we still have the link to the parent dag that\r\nhas its location) and now we can always read this attribute for the\r\ncode view. This should not affect the use of this field for refreshing\r\ndags, because we always refresh the parent for a subdag.\r\n\r\nDear Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-365\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests pass. Added a test to ensure `fileloc` is set properly for dags and sub dags\r\n- Played around with refresh button when changing parent/child dags, works the same as expected\r\n- Code view for parent dag is the same as expected\r\n- Code view for sub dag now shows the proper file, as shown in the screenshot below\r\n- Did the same UI checks for some non-example dags I have\r\n\r\n![sub dag

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nI would like to add the spark-submit operator and hook. Right now we only support spark-sql operations by the SparkSqlOperator. Since spark-submit is a different binary, I've created a new hook and operator.\r\nBesides the fact that spark-submit has much more options to configure, there might be features in the future that share functionality with the spark-sql operator.\r\nOne main implementation difference between the spark-sql and the spark-submit operator is the use of the connection_id of Airflow. It accepts a connection to set the master and the queue.\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-802\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-31T16:55:45Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T21:19:32Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T12:46:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30d4379e954498f9df8840098d061c9fb92e6b3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1e256e7e7a5aaa09a9514a74d54c3c741354ed0e","head":{"label":"Fokko:airflow-802","ref":"airflow-802","sha":"1e256e7e7a5aaa09a9514a74d54c3c741354ed0e","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60533353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDUzMzM1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Fokko/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

special value (-1)\r\nis used to represent unlimited runs, that special value should \r\nbe checked first while evaluating max_runs_reached.\r\n\r\nNote that the cli default arg value for num_runs should be changed\r\nfrom None to -1 to match the SchedulerJob constructor default.\r\n```\r\n    # __init__ for SchedulerJob\r\n    #

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-812\r\n\r\nWhen scheduler run_numbers and run_duration are set to -1 (unlimited),\r\nwe expect the scheduler to run continuously. However, when dag folder is\r\nempty, the scheduler terminates immediately. This is due to a bug in\r\nutils/dag_processing when checking max_runs_reached. Instead the\r\nexistence of dag file should be checked first. If no dag file is\r\npresent, false will be returned.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\nTravis runs on my fork went fine.

If there are suggestions, I'd like to figure it out.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T02:04:23Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T09:03:44Z","closed_at":"2017-02-19T09:03:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9b75318fcb0b00a30f7e991a6b06fd005163593","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/702d3abd0d84773ca27f608d26b1f7243abc7336","head":{"label":"cthenderson:AIRFLOW-809","ref":"AIRFLOW-809","sha":"702d3abd0d84773ca27f608d26b1f7243abc7336","user":{"login":"cthenderson","id":22483630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDgzNjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22483630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson","html_url":"https://github.com/cthenderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76968172,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njk2ODE3Mg==","name":"apache-airflow","full_name":"cthenderson/apache-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cthenderson","id":22483630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDgzNjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22483630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson","html_url":"https://github.com/cthenderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthenderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cthenderson/apache-airflow","description":"Apache

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-780\r\n\r\nThe import errors were no longer working after the multiprocessor update\r\n(since they are cleared after each DAG directory is parsed). This change\r\nfixes them, and adds tests to prevent future regressions.\r\n\r\nAlso fix Py3 incompat in BaseTaskRunner and a couple of linter errors.\r\n\r\nNote that there are a few inefficiencies (e.g. sometimes we delete then add import errors in the same place instead of just doing an update), but this is equivalent to the old behavior.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Added missing unit tests for dag imports. Note that some of them strangely fail for python 3 and it became too time consuming to debug since I don't have a copy of the travis environment, I even ran with the same version of python locally and couldn't reproduce. I have skipped those 3 tests in python 3 for now.\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin @artwr @mistercrunch @plypaul
