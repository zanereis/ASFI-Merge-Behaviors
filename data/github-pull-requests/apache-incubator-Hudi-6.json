Handling both upgrade and downgrade\r\n- Migrating timeline to new layout: a) archived to LSM timeline layout, b) read both json/avro commit metadata, c) rename instants (including clustering action). These are all done for upgrade. For downgrade, I need to write a LSM to legacy archive timeline v1 writer. \r\n- Full compact the table, to get rid of log files. Both in case of upgrade and downgrade.\r\n- Drop version 7.\r\n- Some tests for above.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- LSM to legacy archived timeline writer to use in downgrade.\r\n- Migration path for CDC and incremental queries.\r\n- Handle differences between 0.x and 1.x for stuff needed in upgrade e.g compaction (need to compact older file slice), rollback (marker differences b/w 0.14 and 0.15). Though if we compact and delete any leftover markers, it might be okay.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n**1. Fix the bug**\r\n\r\n- Resolve missing `hoodie.populate.meta.fields` in Table Config (hoodie.properties)\r\n- Enhance validity checks\r\n\r\n**2. Optimize write performance**\r\n\r\n- Reduce unnecessary decoding overhead when disabling meta fields\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImprove write performance. After optimization, the write speed with `hoodie.populate.meta.fields=false` is **42.9% faster** than with `hoodie.populate.meta.fields=true`.\r\n\r\n**Testing method**\r\nConsume from the earliest position in Kafka until all messages are consumed (Kafka Lag = 0), and compare the time taken for both.\r\n\r\n**1）populate meta fields** \r\ntime taken: 21hours and

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooks like we were not surfacing all errors/failures to the caller. So, fixing all such cases in this patch. Added tests w/ both ignoreFailed = false and true and validated the cases.\r\n\r\nCases covered:\r\n\r\nPartition mis-match: when ignoreFailed = true, throws HoodieValidationException to caller. when ignoreFailed = false, validator execution may not fail, but caller can get exception via hasValidationFailure() and validator.getThrowables().get(0)\r\nFile slice mis-match w/ log files: when ignoreFailed = true, throws HoodieValidationException to caller. when ignoreFailed = false, validator execution may not fail, but caller can get exception via hasValidationFailure() and validator.getThrowables().get(0)\r\nRLI mis-match (file slices match, but RLI mis-matches): when ignoreFailed = true, throws HoodieValidationException to caller. when ignoreFailed = false, validator execution may not fail, but caller can get exception via hasValidationFailure() and validator.getThrowables().get(0)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRobust MDT validation.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the case of:\r\n- bulk insert operation,\r\n- `hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable = false`,\r\n- simple bucket index,\r\n\r\nwe could do bulk insert into COW table multiple times. And only the first one will produce parquet files, the next one will produce log files, despite the fact that table type is COW. To prevent it, restrict of `AppendHandleFactory` calling for COW table is added.\r\n\r\nFull discussion is available in https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/12133.\r\n\r\n###

the value of `DATABASE_NAME.key` is lost when `buildHoodieInsertConfig`, so `databaseName` is empty in

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nWhen a corrupted block appears at the end of a Log file, the Trino Reader (LogScanner) fails to read it. This is because Hudi attempts to use InputStream#seek to locate the end of the LogBlock to check for corruption. However, Trino's TrinoInputStream#seek does not necessarily throw an EOFException when seeking beyond the end of the file. In some file systems, such as AzureInputStream#seek and so on, it may throw an IOException.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n**trino-filesystem-azure** AzureInputStream#seek\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void seek(long newPosition)\r\n            throws IOException\r\n    {\r\n        ensureOpen();\r\n        if (newPosition < 0) {\r\n            throw new IOException(\"Negative seek offset\");\r\n        }\r\n        if (newPosition > fileSize) {\r\n            throw new IOException(\"Cannot seek to %s.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRe-writing writes DAG to write to both DT and MDT using same stage boundaries. This will avoid any out of sync issues that might crop up which are needing special handling as of now. The intention behind this dag rewrite is to ensure we write to both DT and MDT table using single dag w/o any breaks inbetween. \r\n\r\nThis is a WIP patch which might get split into multiple patches depending on feedback. \r\n\r\nBefore we go into new DAG, lets revisit how the current dag looks like. \r\nHere is a pictorial representation of how the write dag looks like as of today. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 6 14 29 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/098f5cf7-1c9b-4738-b3ea-646acb91add3)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 6 14 38 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9a12be-2232-4bc4-840a-0e95bcdff7bc)\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the current dag, we feel we could do a streaming write to MDT directly relying on writes to Datatable w/o triggering the actions. So, incase of task retries or stage retries, our marker reconciliation will automatically take care of reconciling any spurious data files. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, here is what the proposal looks like for the new dag. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 6 19 49 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0326489c-89d4-467c-b411-b26850ccd272)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-11-11 at 6 20 15 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae897663-ed0f-4f12-b30f-810c76951dff)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am opening up this patch to get feedback on the design while we try to iterate and get to full blown implementation. \r\n\r\nLets go over one piece at a time. \r\n\r\n## 1. Enabling NBCC for MT\r\nWe are enabling NBCC(Non Blocking Concurrency Control) and multi-writer to MDT to account for multiple writers to write concurrently to Metadata table. This is a pre-requisite since data table could have multiple writers and each of the dag could be running concurrently. Previous dag does not need this necessity, but the redesigned dag need to have NBCC with MDT. Draft patch: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12209. changes have been incorporated in this patch as well. \r\n\r\n## 2. Removing auto commit flow to reduce complexity. \r\nIn general we have two flows wrt write commits, namely auto commit enabled and auto commit disabled flow. We are unifying this and we plan to support only auto commit disabled flow. All user facing writers (batch writers and streaming writers) are using auto commit disabled flow and so this should not have any impact to end users. \r\n\r\nJust that lot of tests are written using auto commit enabled flow and those need to be fixed to use auto commit disabled flow. draft patch: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12204. Again changes have been incorporated in this patch as well. \r\n\r\nAuto commit enabled flow \r\n```\r\nwriteClient.startcommit(instantTime)\r\nreturnVal = writeClient.upsert(RDD<records>, instantTime)\r\n\r\nby this time, the dag is triggered and commit is expected to be complete if there are no errors. \r\n```\r\n\r\nAuto commit disabled flow\r\n```\r\nwriteClient.startcommit(instantTime)\r\nreturnVal = writeClient.upsert(RDD<records>, instantTime)\r\nwriteClient.commitStats(returnVal,....) \r\n\r\nSo, unless user calls `writeClient.commitStats`, the dag may not be triggered and write may not be completed. \r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. MDT Writer instance lifecycle: \r\n\r\n- We need one instance of MDT writer and MDT write client per ingestion commit/table service commit in the data table w/ the new dag design. So, we are introducing a Map of instantTime -> HoodieMetadataTableWriter in the BaseHoodieWriteClient. Expectation is that, a given commit in the data table will instantiate a new HoodieTableMetadataWriter and use it throughout the lifecycle of the commit. In the end, the HTMW will be closed while wrapping up the commit in data table. \r\nRef: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-e44115f0edf69ae17a0249dc1c90e99211f6d9dd072a0e769668c6dd9fe68638 \r\nand https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-14df5e8357e75ba5e6f6e0144a932b70382245f5b70ca8abdcab35fbb4aa43a3 \r\n\r\n- Incase of non-ingestion commits like clean, rollback and restore, we use the old way. Where we instantiate a new HoodieTableMetadataWriter and apply the changes and close it right away. No changes for these actions. \r\n\r\n## 4. Notes on ingestion writes dag. \r\n\r\nLets go over upsert operation in data table. \r\n\r\n- a. BaseHoodieWriteClient.startCommitWithTime() -> will start a new commit in data table. Also, instantiates a new HoodieTableMetadataWriter and starts a new commit. We are introducing new apis in HoodieTableMetadataWriter to support these directly from the Data table write client. \r\n```\r\nvoid startCommit(String instantTime);\r\n```\r\n- b. User calls writeClient.upsert() \r\nLets unpack what happens w/n this method. \r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n.\r\nHoodieWriteMetadata writeMetadata = HoodieTable.upsert(records, commitTime, ...)\r\nwriteMetadata holds a reference to RDD<WriteStatus> \r\nif (metadata table is enabled) {\r\n RDD<WriteStatus> mdtWriteStatuses =   getMetadataWriter(commitTime).get().prepareAndWriteToMDT(writeMetadata.getDataTableWriteStatuses(), commitTime);\r\n writeMetadata.setAllWriteStatus(writeMetadata.getDataTableWriteStatuses().union(mdtWriteStatuses))\r\n}\r\nreturn writeMetadata.clone(allWriteStats)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter we write to data table, we have an RDD<WriteStatus> \r\nWe have introduced new apis in HoodieTableMetadataWriter (prepareAndWriteToMDT) to write to MDT directly based on RDD<WriteStatus> from data table. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  HoodieData<WriteStatus> prepareAndWriteToMDT(HoodieData<WriteStatus> writeStatus, String instantTime);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe wanted to keep the FILES partition out of this write so that we can write in finally in the end after reconciling the commit metadata for data table. So, every other partition or index in Metadata table gets written using this api. \r\n\r\nThis method(prepareAndWriteToMDT) will return metadataTable's RDD<WriteStatus>. \r\nWe stitch both writeStatus' and send it back. So, WriteClient.upsert() will return a RDD<WriteStatus> which has a mix of data table write status and metadata table write status. \r\n\r\nbtw, do remember that the dag is not yet triggered next api (c) is called. In other words, just by calling writeClient.upsert(), even data files to data table will not be written. \r\n\r\nRef code to review:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839032523 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839024169\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839020184 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839025342\r\n\r\n\r\nc. User calls writeClient.commit(commitTime, return value from (b) above) \r\nLets unpack, what happens within this call. \r\n- i. We finally trigger the action from the RDD<WriteStatus> (i.e. return value from (b) above). This will result in all data files written to data table and all files written to Metadata table for all partitions except FILES partition. \r\n- ii. Prepare HoodieCommit Metadata for data table. \r\n- iii. Perform marker reconciliation for data table. \r\n- iv. In step c.i above, we would have collected List<HoodieWriteStats> of metadata table HoodieWriteStats as well. We re-use this and call into HoodieTableMetadataWriter.writeToFilesPartitionAndCommit(instantTime, mdtHoodieWriteStats, HoodieCommitMetadata of interest). \r\n\r\n```\r\n  void writeToFilesPartitionAndCommit(String instantTime, HoodieEngineContext context, List<HoodieWriteStat> partialMdtWriteStats, HoodieCommitMetadata commitMetadata);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this api does is:\r\n- Using HoodieCommitMetadata from data table, we prepare and write to FILES partition in MDT. \r\n- Stitch List<HoodieWriteStats> from c.i (i.e. partialMdtWriteStats) and List<HoodieWriteStats> from writes to FILES partition above and complete the commit to MetadataTable. This means, that we would have performed marker reconciliation for Metadata table as well as part of this step. i.e. delete any spurious files in MDT. \r\n\r\n- v. Wrap up the commit in Data table. \r\n\r\nPlease checkout changes in SparkRDDWriteClient, HoodieTableMetadataWriter, HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter and SparkHoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, we have fixed upsert() operation to test this dag and it works as expected. i.e. writes to both data table and metadata table happens within a single dag w/o any breaks. writes to FILES partition in MDT happens in the end and finally we wrap up the commit in both metadata table and data table. \r\n\r\nRef code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839037534 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839039325\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839040074\r\n\r\n## 5. Metadata Partitioner: \r\n\r\nOne tricky part to achieve above is to design the metadata table partitioner. If we use the out of the box UpsertPartitioner, the workload profile building stage will trigger the action. So, here is what we have done to circumvent that dag trigger. \r\nWhile initializing the HoodieTableMetadataWriter itself, we will know what partitions in MDT is enabled and file group count for the same. So, we use that info to build SparkMetadataUpsertPartitioner. All records are expected to be tagged w/ the fileID location by the time we reach the metadata table upsertPrepped call. So, we leverage that to decide the spark partitioner. \r\nBy this trick, we completely avoid triggering the dag and keep it streaming from data table writes all the way to metadata table writes. \r\n\r\nRef code: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-c13aba8c32dad9b38d5b82bd5f6c99c26b932d79d89e42ef83c8206b5e3005db\r\n\r\n## 6. UpsertPreppedPartial: \r\nBased on the dag re-design, we are writing to Metadata table twice using the same delta commit time. So, none of our apis in writeClient are designed to work that way. So, we are introducing upsertPreppedPartial to assist in this case. We have validations in place to ensure this is used only for metadata table writes. So, its feasible to call writeClient.startCommit(t10.dc), writeClient.upsertPreppedPartial(batch1), writeClient.upsertPreppedPartial(batch2) \r\nand finally writeClient.commit(t10.dc..) \r\n\r\nRef code: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839046857 \r\n\r\n## 7. New MT Upsert Commit Action Executor\r\n\r\nWe have introduced SparkMetadataTableUpsertCommitActionExecutor to assist w/ writing to Metadata table. This will receive RDD<records>, creates an empty inflight file (empty workload profile), use SparkMetadataUpsertPartitioner to repartition records, and write to them. \r\n\r\nRef code: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-4bc75096f7c67d1b0e302b4d2be9e01702db698821c6dfe8c7a28c1614b6f89f\r\n\r\n## 8. Zooming in on prepareAndWriteToMDT Impl:\r\nHigh level steps unpacked in this method impl is given below:\r\n- Input : RDD<WriteStatus>. \r\n- We do flatMap over RDD<WriteStatus> and prepare Metadata table records (col stats, RLI, bloom etc). \r\n- Some partitions in MDT needs one spark task per physical hudi partition. For eg, partition stats index. So, we also repartition based on hudi partition and process all writeStatuses to prepare records for partition stats index. \r\n- Union above set of records. \r\n- Tag location \r\n- return RDD<HoodieRecord> \r\n\r\nWe have introduced MetadataIndexGenerator and SparkMetadataIndexGenerator to assist with preparing MDT records. \r\n\r\nNote: We will be fixing all other write operations (bulk insert, insert, delete, insert overwrite, etc) in a similar fashion. In this patch, upsert() is implemented as a reference. \r\n\r\nRef code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-4bad9395622cd04b5332d2dd195b7a407487cfcd43ed421f74c74ce1ead564b9 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-1f59d767b16a65c15c2795a81bbb46edf03b2c41152339259582cdf40059bdc8 \r\n\r\n\r\n## 11. Metadata table rollbacks: \r\nPrior to this design, clean failed rollback policy was eager in MDT. So, whenever we start a new commit in MDT, if there are any pending commits, we auto rollback it. But w/ NBCC, clean failed rollback policy is lazy. So, this means that heart beat will be emitted by the mdt writeClient when the delta commit starts. Lazily if the processed crashes, later when cleaner in MDT executes, it will check for failed writes (elapsed heart beats) and trigger rollback. With the dag re-design, we can't let this happen. So, we are disabling this rollback by the cleaner for Metadata table. Any failed write in Metadata table will have a failed write in DataTable as well. So, data table will have to trigger rollback at somepoint (based on whether its single writer or multi writer). So, the same will trigger a rollback in Metadata table if the commit of interest exists in Metadata table. So, its safe to disable the auto rollbacks in MDT. \r\n\r\nRef code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-87151a25afbb138b6d05bc0f187b3111af5199c8f0f2628a8beb8a21c3c14980\r\n\r\n## 12. WriteStatus changes: \r\nSince we have a single RDD<WriteStatus> at the end of writeClient.upsert(), we have introduced a boolean flag in WriteStatus to denote whether is it for data table or Metadata table. So, we use that to bucketize and prepare HoodieCommitMetadata for the Data table. \r\n\r\nRef code: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839056049\r\n\r\n## 13. DT Compaction \r\n\r\nIf you have gotten a grasp of ingestion commits dag, lets go to compaction. I have not fixed data table clustering yet in this patch. But changes to compaction should pretty much give you an idea. \r\n\r\nLets take a peek at how compaction control flow looks like w/ the new dag.\r\nWe are not going to touch the scheduling of compaction w/ this dag rewrite exercise. Only during compaction execution, we will touch MDT. \r\n- a. WriteClient.compact(compactionTime)\r\n-      b. (a) will call into TableServiceClient.compact(compactionTime, shouldComplete). \r\n-      All of our HoodieTableMetadataWriter instances and the map is maintained by the data table BaseHoodieTableWriteClient. So, while instantiating TableServiceClient, we pass in a function which can assist in fetching the metadata writer instance \r\n```\r\nFunctions.Function2<String, HoodieTableMetaClient, Option<HoodieTableMetadataWriter>>\r\n```\r\n-          c. lets expand on compact() impl in TableServiceClient. \r\n```\r\n.\r\n.\r\nApply the metadataWriterFunc to get an instance of HoodieTableMetadataWriter. \r\nHoodieTableMetadataWriter.startCommit(compactionCommit)\r\nHoodieWriteMetadata compactionWriteMetadata = HoodieTable.compact(...) \r\n// this compactionWriteMetadata contains RDD<WriteStatus> which is not yet triggered. \r\nWrite to Metadata table (partial writes except FILES partition) and get hold of RDD<WriteStatus> for metadata table. \r\nStitch both writeStatuses and set it as part of compactionWriteMetadata. \r\nreturn compactionWriteMetadata\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, tableServiceWriteClient and writeClient.compact() will return `HoodieWriteMetadata compactionWriteMetadata` which will contain RDD<WriteStatus>. Dag is not yet triggered. \r\n\r\n\r\n-  d. caller is expected to call writeClient.commitCompaction(compactionTime, compactionWriteMetadata (from compact() call), ..) \r\nLets zoom in a bit here. \r\n- we call collect on the RDD<WriteStatus> in compactionWriteMetadata. This is when the dag will be triggered (i.e writes to both Data table and MDT partitions(except FILES) will happen. \r\n- Bucketize data table HoodieWriteStat and MetadataTable HoodieWriteStats. \r\n- Prepare HoodieCommitMetadata for data table. \r\n- Perform marker reconciliation for data table. \r\n- Write to MDT files partition using writeToFilesPartitionAndCommit. \r\n- Complete the dc in MDT for `compactionTime`\r\n- Complete the compaction commit in Data table. \r\n\r\nChanges for ingestion writes were mostly straightforward w/ the revamped dag. But for compaction, we had to make some changes. \r\n- Before this patch, HoodieTable.compact() call itself triggers the compaction dag in data table. We prepare the HoodieCommitMetadata and return it as part of HoodieTable.compact(). So, HoodieWriteMetadata that was returned as part of HoodieTable.compact() call, contains a List<HoodieWriteStat> and RDD<WriteStatus> too. \r\nBut this is against our goal of making the dag fully streaming from data table all the way to metadata table. So, we had to make changes to HoodieTable.compact() to trigger the dag. Hence HoodieCommitMetadata cannot be prepared until writeClient.commitCompaction() is invoked which is when the dag will be triggered.  \r\n\r\nNote: As you could see, we are changing the compaction dag here. For eg, even if someone disabled Metadata table completely, the compaction execution uses a diff flow w/ this revamp. So, if you are reviewing, do pay close attention to these code blocks. \r\n\r\nRef code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839059354 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839062145 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#r1839063857 \r\n\r\n\r\n## 14. MDT stats generation:\r\nAs per the design, our intention is to generate all required stats for MDT record generation in the data table write handle itself and pass it along w/ WriteStatus. FILES, RLI and col stats are taken care in this patch. For col stats, prior to this patch, only Append handle was generating the stats. But with this patch, even create handle and merge handle is generating col stats and attaching it to the WriteStatus. General idea here is to embed all required stats (col stats, bloom filter, functional index, secondary index) in the WriteStatus returned from writehandles in data table. \r\n\r\nRef code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-b85f7289adc6d3bd6ecc32feab502e2e95f70539e1186d479fd0815d58485f84 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-44402d60ebabe11a4826e9c8a548b1737b32b0664f6af3c379d933b899e295a8 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12236/files#diff-63a77e05c924278c190061a1a18a992a7f9480af14f0f34f4328bf72ae673fe9 \r\n\r\n## Things to flesh out/Pending items:\r\n\r\n- Non incremental write operations might need some special handling for some MDT partitions. In general, our design relies on the fact that everything will be embedded in write status by the write handles. Incase of `insert_overwrite` for RLI partition, we might have to poll FSV to fetch latest base files and then record keys in them. So, polling FSV is not a generally recommended from executor. and here we are in need of doing it for lot of files and so we can't just delegate the work to one write handle. So, this needs to be figured out. \r\n- One more pending piece in the overall picture is the row writer flow for bulk insert. We also need to align the row writer code path w/ the new dag. We do not want to have any divergence w/ the dag re-write. Current patch does not have the fix for row writer. \r\n- In the interest of time, I am wondering if we can fix auto commit enabled flow as well for upserts an other write operations so that we do not need to chase 300+ test failures. and take up the deprecation of auto commit enabled flow separately. \r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- None of the tests are fixed yet. We picked couple of sanity tests for COW and MOR table (compaction) and ensure end to end design is viable and works as expected. While we work on pending items and as we get feedback on the design, we will work towards fixing the tests. \r\n- Since we are deprecating auto commit enabled flow, lot of tests are failing and we need to fix all of them. https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12204 \r\n\r\nNote: We will be introducing a flag to enable the new optimized dag and will be turned off by default. Optimized dag will be fully implemented for spark. Flink and java will be taken up later. \r\n\r\nFeel feel to comment on the overall design or any code blocks in particular. Since this has a very large blast radius, we wanted to ensure we don't have any gaps in the design or impl.\r\n\r\nIn the next one day or two, I will try to add `Notes to reviewer\" as well so as to help w/ reviewing. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

the previous \"Create table with record keys and ordering fields\" section, the example created a table with a partitioned column `dt` that was not defined in the schema. This omission will cause errors when running the SQL code, as Flink SQL requires all partitioned columns to be present in the table schema.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `sql_ddl.md` to include the `dt` column in the table schema when using `PARTITIONED BY (dt)`, ensuring that the example can be executed without errors. Additionally, it clarifies that all partition columns must exist in the schema to prevent similar issues.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd line wrapping indentation check: `forceStrictCondition=true`\r\n\r\nExplanation about CheckStyle Option `forceStrictCondition`:\r\n```\r\nForce strict indent level in line wrapping case.\r\n If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. \r\n If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nHelp identify issues with inconsistent line wrapping and indentation, such as:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Function Parameter Line Wrapping\r\n```\r\n// `Context context` is indented by 6 characters\r\npublic StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator(\r\n      Configuration conf,\r\n         Context context) {\r\n    this.conf = conf;\r\n    this.context = context;\r\n    this.parallelism = context.currentParallelism();\r\n    this.storageConf = HadoopFSUtils.getStorageConfWithCopy(HadoopConfigurations.getHiveConf(conf));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // `int numEntries` is aligned with `(`\r\n  private static void verifyHFileReadCompatibility(String filename,\r\n                                                   int numEntries,\r\n                                                   Option<Function<Integer, String>> keyCreator) throws IOException {\r\n    try (HFileReader reader = getHFileReader(filename)) {\r\n      reader.initializeMetadata();\r\n      verifyHFileMetadataCompatibility(reader, numEntries);\r\n      verifyHFileValuesInSequentialReads(reader, numEntries, keyCreator);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Inconsistent Line Wrapping and Indentation\r\n```\r\nvalidatePathInfoList(\r\n        Arrays.stream(new StoragePathInfo[] {\r\n            getStoragePathInfo(\"x/1.file\", false),\r\n

storage.listDirectEntries(new StoragePath(getTempDir(), \"x\")));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nhigh\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, nested schema and complex data types are not handled properly in DataHubSyncTool and only root level fields get synced leaving behind child ones. This PR adds support for complex data types and nested schema which makes schema navigation in the DataHub UI more intuitive\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo api changes. This PR updates a helper method in DataHubSyncClient for creating DataHub schema out of Avro schema\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-10T15:08:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T03:44:12Z","closed_at":"2024-12-30T15:15:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter debugging, I found that upgrade path is invoked but the `metaClient` is not reloaded after that. Simply reloading in `tryUpgrade` is not enough because we call that in a lambda. So, this PR fixes the issue as follows:\r\n\r\n- Updated `doInitTable()` to return the potentially reloaded `metaClient`, allowing `initTable()` to access the updated `metaClient` reference after an upgrade. \r\n- Enhanced `HoodieCommitMetadata.fromBytes()` method with a fallback mechanism for JSON deserialization given that commit metadata serialization changed from json to avro in 1.0.\r\n\r\nTested manually by running the same steps as mentioned in HUDI-8395.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRefactor metaClient handling during upgrade/downgrade, and implement fallback in JSON deserialization.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-08T17:49:24Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T14:08:34Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T14:08:34Z","merged_at":"2024-11-15T14:08:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"71079958a7bca0d85170bba3a243a52aef1c9770","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\ncode + test\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFor implicit lock provider `org.apache.hudi.aws.transaction.lock.DynamoDBBasedImplicitPartitionKeyLockProvider` and  `org.apache.hudi.client.transaction.lock.ZookeeperBasedImplicitBasePathLockProvider`, inside the lock key (for zookeeper) / partition key (for ddb) it contains substring `<tablename>-<hash of table basepath>`.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic in case of alter table rename, some writers are using the old lock key while others are using the new one, which leads to concurrency bug as the lock fails to synchronize operations from concurrent operators.\r\n\r\nAlter rename should not have coupling with locks, so to remove the dependency, we removed the table name from the lock key for both implicit ddb and zookeeper lock provider.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe should update the merge into doc about this new

Change Logs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Merge into updated & insert actions will fail the query once detect column type mismatch for primary key/partition key/precombined key\r\n\r\nAllowing implicit casting of partition key can leads to partition path corruption. An example is if we do MIT where source table has a double value column and target table partitions on the same column with int type, after merge into completes the partition path will contain double value. Later select queries over the table will complain it cannot convert double to int.\r\n\r\nAllowing implicit casting of primary key can leads to data correctness issue. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n        // Create target table with double primary key\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |create table $targetTable (\r\n             |  id double,\r\n             |  name string,\r\n             |  value_double double,\r\n             |  ts long\r\n             |) using hudi\r\n             |location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}/$targetTable'\r\n             |tblproperties (\r\n             |  type = '$tableType',\r\n             |  primaryKey = 'id',\r\n             |  preCombineField = 'ts'\r\n             |)\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        // Create source table with int primary key\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |create table $sourceTable (\r\n             |  id int,\r\n             |  name string,\r\n             |  value_double double,\r\n             |  ts long\r\n             |) using hudi\r\n             |location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}/$sourceTable'\r\n             |tblproperties (\r\n             |  type = '$tableType',\r\n             |  primaryKey = 'id',\r\n             |  preCombineField = 'ts'\r\n             |)\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        // Insert initial data into target table\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |insert into $targetTable\r\n             |select\r\n             |  cast(1 as double) as id,\r\n             |  'initial1' as name,\r\n             |  1.1 as value_double,\r\n             |  1000 as ts\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        // Insert data into source table with int ids\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |insert into $sourceTable\r\n             |select\r\n             |  1 as id,\r\n             |  'updated1' as name,\r\n             |  1.11 as value_double,\r\n             |  1001 as ts\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        // Perform merge operation\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |merge into $targetTable t\r\n             |using $sourceTable s\r\n             |on t.id = s.id\r\n             |when matched then update set *\r\n             |when not matched then insert *\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\nIn the end we expect target table with 1 record\r\n(1, updated1, 1.1, 1001)\r\n\r\nbut actually it is\r\n(1, initial, 1.1, 1000)\r\n(1, updated1, 1.1, 1001)\r\n\r\nFor precombined field we enforce the same data type check to avoid any potential data correctness issue.\r\n\r\nIf target table id column is int, we got the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Merge into delete action continues to follow today's behavior\r\n\r\nDelete action does not require strict data type matching, as long as the column types are cast-able from source columns to target columns, it is allowed.\r\n\r\n- Unlike insert/update which contains assignment from source to target, delete operation does not assign values but just comparing them in the ON clause, we just need to ensure the comparison part accounts for type mismatches. Especially, the precombined key column is out of scope as it only takes effect when assignment happens. Similarily, if partition key/primary key are not involved in ON clause, we don't need to do any check.\r\n- For condition clause, the recordKeyAttributeToConditionExpression variable already takes care of data type handling for both columns. Today's behavior is it will do best effort type casting to match source column data type to target, if cast succeeds everything works as expected, otherwise incompatible data type error is thrown.\r\n\r\n### For all other data column types, implicit type casting is allowed and validated.\r\n\r\nSince MIT only requires column type matches for the 3 types of columns, for others spark-hudi did implicit type casting. Tests are written to capture the exhaustive behavior of such handling.\r\n\r\nhandle delete MIT action + exhaustive coverage\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMerge into insert & update actions now enforce strict column data type matching for primary key, precombined key and partition key. Queries previously work might error out.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe should update the merge into doc about this new restriction.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe heartbeat should be removed from memory when it has been explicitly stopped (in the post-commit step, which means the instant has been committed), otherwise the heartbeat is left in memory until the write client has been stopped entirely. In streaming pipeline, the write client is been reused for multiple instants.\r\n\r\nThe heartbeats are mainly designed for lazy cleaning and very probaly the clean table service is executed asynchronously on another workload, the in-memory heatbeat does not make any sense for a committed instant actually.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\n - Annotate log headers, blocks with table version (tv)\r\n - Handle both tv=6, and tv=8 for log naming\r\n - Eliminate notion of rolloverWriteToken\r\n - Simplify/make efficient log writer building across code paths\r\n - Handle both tv=6 & 8 for log version, handling\r\n - Prevent tv=8 headers from being written with tv=6.\r\n - Bring back tv=6 rollback behavior.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nHudi writers can now write tableVersion 6 compatible log format, in addition to tableVersion 8.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nA significant number of tests set the partition column name to a column that doesn't exist in the table schema. I tried to get rid of this: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12176, but this is deeply embedded in our testing, and some of the tables are actually partitioned. How I resolve this illegal table state is by setting the drop partition config in the same place where the fake partition name is added. Nearly all tests still passed after this change, but it exposed some minor bugs with how we handle drop partition cols. \r\n\r\nThose places that were fixed are:\r\n\r\ncompaction -> either it is not dropping the column, or the commit metadata has the partition column\r\n\r\nrow writer clustering -> write configs not set for partition column names and recordkey column names, also, key generator is not deduced properly\r\n\r\nHive reader context -> didn't handle drop partition columns correctly\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\ntests reflect a real situation, fixed a few bugs with drop partition config\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe process of sorting Hudi's base file and log file data by primary key is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. During the delta commit phase, the data is sorted.\r\n2. During the compaction phase, the data is sorted and merged using merge sort.\r\n\r\nDelta Commit: The batch data written is sorted by primary key\r\nCompaction: [Compaction with Merge Sort Implementation link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10hHkQsd0bCdCor4w9Wduds5l-i_Z7X7A-zk_vYYi4kA/edit#slide=id.p13)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSorting the base file and log file data in Hudi offers the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. **Enhancing Hudi Reader Performance**: After sorting the data, merge sort can be used to read the data, thereby avoiding the large memory usage or disk IO overhead associated with Map-based methods.\r\n2. **Improving Compaction Performance**: Sorted data can also utilize merge sort during the merging process, reducing the large memory usage and disk IO overhead required by Map-based methods.\r\n4. **Supporting MDT Introduction of Primary Key Index**: Sorted data facilitates the introduction of spare index similar to those in ClickHouse, thus improving the query efficiency of Hudi Reader.\r\n\r\nPerformance Comparison After Introducing **Ordered Hudi Data** (Including Compaction with Merge Sort and Log Compaction with Merge Sort), **Primary Key Index** and **Secondary Index**: [Performance Comparison link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10hHkQsd0bCdCor4w9Wduds5l-i_Z7X7A-zk_vYYi4kA/edit#slide=id.p19)\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen we specify `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field=ts:timestamp`, the partition column `ts` has data type `Long`. When we specify `hoodie.keygen.timebased.output.dateformat=yyyyMMdd---HH`, then the partition column `ts` value becomes a string in format `yyyyMMdd---HH`.\r\n\r\nWhen the file index tries to collect the file list grouped by a partition path, Hudi parses the partition path value (`yyyyMMdd---HH`), and converted into their original data type (Long).\r\n\r\nThe solution is to avoid using their original type when they are specified using `<column>:timestamp` format, and uses `String` as their type to avoid any conversion failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo failures is caused when we specified the partition using `<column>:timestamp` format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix data skipping with RLI if record key is composite. When there are multiple record key fields, we need to form the record keys sequence correctly. Added a test to show skipping with more than one record key fields.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupport data skipping for complex primary keys\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently log files are not validated while validating column stats. The Jira aims to fix the validation logic so that log files are also validated along with base files.\r\nAlso if col stats validation fails, partition stats validation can be skipped since partition stats validation depends on col stats validation.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPruned partition filters were not being used while doing prefix lookup for functional index records. This PR fixes that and also adds a minor optimization for getting pruned partitions and file names in a single iteration in `SparkBaseIndexSupport`. Added a test to validate the partition filter being used.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOptimization for functional index reads.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Flink engine, if exception occurs when task writing data, it will be ignored and the exception will be reported to StreamWriteCoordinator with write event, StreamWriteCoordinator will decide whether to commit when there is write failure according to 'write.ignore.failed'.\r\n\r\nThis PR apply 'write.ignore.failed' ahead when write failure occurs, thus throw an exception faster.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\nCP interval of Flink job is 15 minutes, the exception will not be found until CP commit, it will make a longer data latency in real-time sensitive scenarios.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Remove `targetBasePath` check because Hudi should just throw `TableNotFoundException ` later on if this path is not valid/does not exist.\r\n- Remove redundant initialization of

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Flink engine, if exception occurs when task writing data, it will be ignored and the exception will be reported to StreamWriteCoordinator with write event, StreamWriteCoordinator will decide whether to commit when there is write failure according to 'write.ignore.failed'.\r\n \r\nThis PR apply 'write.ignore.failed' ahead when write failure occurs, thus throw an exception faster.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\nCP interval of Flink job is 15 minutes, the exception will not be found until CP commit, it will make a longer data latency in real-time sensitive scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nmodule: hudi-client、 hudi-flink-datasource\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

when hudi performs Snapshot-Query on MOR table, each required file-slice will be provided to Spark as a Partition.\r\nIn some scenarios, for example, the amount of data required for each file-slice is small, in which case a lot of spark tasks will be generated, resulting in a lot of resource consumption in task scheduling and resource application.\r\nSo I think we can provide a process with different strategies (file-size based / hash value based / custom...) to combine multiple file-slice to one Partition to reduce total task num for better performance.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n1. refactor HoodieBaseRelation and its subclass to introduce multiple file-slice each task\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\nnone\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new partition pruner for Flink source based on the Partition Stats Index.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Flink source (batch or streaming) uses partition filters pushed down to build partition pruner and filter irrelevant partitions. Then, Column Stats Index is used to build data pruner to do the file-level data skipping. HUDI-7144 introduced the partition-level column stats, we can use the stats to prune partitions just like the way files are pruned.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n* Add utilities to fetch Partition Stats Index data for Flink source.\r\n* Add a new partition pruner `ColumnStatsPartitionPruner`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nEnhance the data skipping ability for Flink source by introducing a new partition pruner based on Partition Stats Index.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nnone \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read
