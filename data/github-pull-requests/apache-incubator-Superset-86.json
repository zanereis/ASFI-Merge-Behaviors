SUMMARY\r\nWhen a dashboard has both a native time range filter AND a filter box with a date filter, the native time range filter won't apply to charts, even if the filter box is set to \"No filter\". This is due to the filter box taking precedence over the native filter without evaluating if it's set or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes this so that the filter box doesn't override the value of the native filter if its value is \"No filter\" (the constant `NO_TIME_RANGE`). This is done by checking that the filter box time range is set earlier in the code flow. This check was previously done when setting the filter indicator status - this logic and associated unit tests were removed as they're now handled upstream. However, if both are set, the filter box takes precedence as before. Unit tests are added to handle both cases.\r\n\r\nCloses #16839\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter this change the native time range filter applies properly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134904062-2e212dd3-0c24-4d1d-8012-1f39d92d929f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the native time range filter doesn't apply to a chart if the dashboard has a filter box with a date filter (see the missing `year >= 1971` in the query):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134904152-8b097d0c-02c9-454b-9ac0-32e525dcfc48.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAntd button design disallows all cursor events when a button is disabled, which turns off our tooltips on disabled buttons. The easiest solution is outlined here: https://github.com/react-component/tooltip/issues/18\r\n\r\nSummarized, you have to wrap a disabled button in a span to show the tooltip. However, if you have a span on an enabled button then you get two tooltips. This PR wraps the button in a span if it is disabled. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/134715010-0a96d60b-1e28-4fa3-9ce6-d953fad98b31.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nHave the KV/store featureflag disabled in your superset_config. \r\n\r\nWrite a query, hover over the copy link to see if there is a tooltip. There should be a tooltip. \r\nSave the query, the color should change and there should be a different tooltip. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent perf improvement PR #16545 introduced a regression where some chart indicators didn't update correctly after applying filters. This was caused by all indicators sharing the same state that was used to check if the relevant data had changed. This changes the logic so that all indicators have their own set of \"previous\" objects to ensure that the result is recalculated when a relevant change has occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen checking if this was also a problem with the legacy indicators I noticed that the logic there mostly resembles the proposed solution here, so this shouldn't be a problem there.\r\n\r\nFixes: #16806\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen applying new filters, all filter indicators are now updated correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134664630-3b976327-839a-462a-8c0f-9b7531387d4b.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously only the first few charts' indicators were updated; the later ones always hit the cache due to the shared state having already been updated and hence satisfying the equality checks:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134664733-1af9ec65-a23f-463f-9b4e-f03ef3cc3612.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe fix in #16460 didn't address the special case of numeric filter values sometimes being temporal filters. It also introduced a new util for formatting filter values whose functionality was already covered by the much more comprehensive `getDataRecordFormatter` factory function, which also handles time and number formatting. The redundant formatter is removed and replaced by `getDataRecordFormatter` which was already being used for formatting the options in the Select component. This will ensure that the filter indicator displays identical values as the Select component.\r\n\r\nCloses #16808\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134639890-b8fbcc43-be57-4110-9714-dc073eee5034.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134640985-3ec79ea5-525d-4b65-bea6-ed237f01dd4c.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

href=\"https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/releases\">react-select's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>react-select@5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Upgrade Guide</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert to TypeScript (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - TypeScript types now come packaged with <code>react-select</code> so you no longer need to have <code>@types/react-select</code> installed; we no longer include Flow types</li>\n<li>Drop IE11 support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4625\">#4625</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4720\">#4720</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4634\">#4634</a>) - this allows us to make changes to our CSS that we've wanted to make for a long time as well as remove unnecessary JS solutions (those changes are noted below)</li>\n<li>Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - this means that if you were accessing anything on the <code>Select</code> instance using a <code>ref</code>, the <code>ref</code> will now reference the internal <code>Select</code> directly (see below for how to upgrade)</li>\n<li>Replace HOCs with hooks (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - if you were using our HOCs to create custom <code>Select</code>s (i.e., <code>makeCreatableSelect</code>, <code>mangeState</code>, <code>makeAsyncSelect</code>) these have now been replaced by hooks (i.e., <code>useCreatable</code>, <code>useStateManager</code>, <code>useAsync</code>)</li>\n<li>Remove dependency on <a href=\"https://github.com/JedWatson/react-input-autosize\">AutosizeInput</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4625\">#4625</a>) - our new solution uses CSS grid which IE11 does not fully support; also <code>.prefix__input</code> now targets the input and NOT the container</li>\n<li>Improve screen reader experience (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4676\">#4676</a>) - this isn't a breaking change in the API but it does change the screen reader announcements</li>\n<li>Use CSS grid for single value layout (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4720\">#4720</a>) - this also isn't a breaking change in the API but is it a change in the styles since it switches to using CSS grid (not fully supported by IE11) for single-value <code>Select</code>s</li>\n<li>Remove <code>readonly</code> attribute on our <code>DummyInput</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4634\">#4634</a>) - this results in better accessibility but uses <code>caret-color</code> which is not available on IE11</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Details</h2>\n<h3>Convert to TypeScript</h3>\n<p>We've rewritten <code>react-select</code> in TypeScript which means you can remove any dependencies on <code>@types/react-select</code>. If you were using the Flow types than look into contributing types for v5 to <code>flow-typed</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are the most notable changes when replacing <code>@types/react-select</code> with our packaged types:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code>@‚Äãtypes/react-select</code></th>\n<th>react-select</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>OptinTypeBase</code></td>\n<td>no replacement</td>\n<td>Options can be any type (if using <code>getOptionValue</code> and <code>getOptionLabel</code>) so there's no longer a base type for options</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>OptionsType</code></td>\n<td><code>Options</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GroupTypeBase</code></td>\n<td><code>GroupBase</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GroupedOptionsType</code></td>\n<td>no replacement</td>\n<td>This is equivalent to <code>ReadonlyArray&lt;Group&gt;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ValueType</code></td>\n<td><code>OnChangeValue</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>InputActionTypes</code></td>\n<td><code>InputAction</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>NamedProps</code></td>\n<td><code>Props</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Select</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AsyncSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreatableSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AsyncCreatableSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Drop IE11 support</h3>\n<p>This allows us to use modern CSS in order to improve the quality of <code>react-select</code> and remove excessive JavaScript code to work around not having the ability to use modern CSS. If you need IE11 support either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stay on v4.</li>\n<li>Attempt to use our <a href=\"https://react-select.com/styles\">Styles API</a> and/or <a href=\"https://react-select.com/components\">Components API</a> to override styles and/or components that don't support IE11. The only change that might be hard to override is &quot;Remove <code>readonly</code> attribute on our <code>DummyInput</code>&quot; since you can't override the <code>DummyInput</code> component with the Styles or Components API.</li>\n<li>If there are simple changes that make <code>react-select</code> compatible with IE11, open a PR. We are unlikely to provide official support for IE11 since supporting IE11 makes maintaining <code>react-select</code> a lot more difficult and holds us back from changes we want to make, but we also are glad to accept simple changes if they make your life easier.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components</h3>\n<p>NOTE: Accessing any of the internals of the <code>Select</code> component using <code>ref</code>s is not part of our public API. The internals of the <code>Select</code> component can change at any time (including in minor and patch releases). The only methods on the <code>Select</code> component that are part of the public API are the <code>focus()</code> and <code>blur()</code> methods.</p>\n<p><code>react-select</code> exports five components: <code>BaseSelect</code>, <code>CreatableSelect</code>, <code>Select</code> (the default export), <code>AsyncSelect</code>, <code>AsyncCreatableSelect</code>. The last four components are wrappers around the <code>BaseSelect</code>. Previously the <code>ref</code> for each of these components was pointing to itself, but now we use <code>forwardRef</code> which means that the <code>ref</code>s for all five components now point to <code>BaseSelect</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>focus()</code> and <code>blur()</code> methods are untouched by this change. However if you were accessing the internals of the <code>BaseSelect</code> component, you will need to update how you were accessing the <code>BaseSelect</code>. Here is how to update access to the <code>BaseSelect</code> component:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nBigQuery is not quoting column names correctly when generating a `SELECT *` statement. Columns with reserved names are **not quoted** because the DB engine spec overrides the `_get_fields()` method and intentionally removes the quotes. This is done because at some point nested fields were not working with backticks (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5655).\r\n\r\nI tested previewing data without the custom `_get_fields` and the SQL is generated correctly today, so I removed the use of `literal_column` to bring the quoting back. Additionally, I fixed `SELECT *` so that arrays of records work correctly. Currently, if you have a column `foo` that is an array of records `(a int, b string)` the generated data preview query looks like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  foo,\r\n  foo.a,  -- bad\r\n  foo.b   -- also bad\r\nFROM ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails, because the expanded syntax only works in records, not arrays of records. Eg, in the example I used we have a column `author` that is a record with fields `(name, email, ...)`. In that case, we **want** the data preview query to have:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  author,  -- maybe this should be removed?\r\n  author.name,\r\n  author.email,\r\n  ...\r\nFROM ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that when we have an array of records the pseudo-columns show up in the metadata browser:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-27 at 16-44-33  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/135000943-520699ff-b893-4bc9-b713-708981fca1f0.png)\r\n\r\nBut they're not present in the preview.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore we get an error because `limit` and `offset` are not quoted.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-23 at 15-37-49  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/134593968-4beb8592-c40c-4e64-84ee-9ad83b1e5e6a.png)\r\n\r\nNote also that `LIMIT` is applied twice, since the parser is unable to find the limit of the query due to the lack of quoting.\r\n\r\nAfter (the table has no data):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-23 at 15-41-12  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/134593976-7f01d41b-e988-47c7-bc97-84ce85e86cdf.png)\r\n\r\nThe LIMIT is applied correctly now, the query is sent as:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT `limit`,       `offset`FROM `test`.`bad_column_names`LIMIT 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd runs as:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT `limit`,\r\n `offset`\r\nFROM `test`.`bad_column_names`\r\nLIMIT 101\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAfter filing near 300 and triaged near 1000 issues in Superset repo, I found that having reproduce steps right after the 'one sentence

often forget to provide repro steps( which is the most important info) as the section was not in a prominent section. \r\n- The info in Issue description and Expected results seem repetitive.

SUMMARY\r\nWith Node 16 being the currently recommended version since 2021-04-20 and becoming the LTS supported version on 2021-10-26, it makes sense to migrate to this version to get all the benefits available in the new release:\r\nhttps://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-16-available-now-7f5099a97e70\r\nAlso removes the workaround for pulling in `npm@7` in #16748 (npm 7 ships by default with Node 16)\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some tests that were previously passing but contained unhandled promise rejections. Previously these only emitted warnings, but as of Node 15 these caused errors. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure the application works as expected - done (running on the new build):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/134489123-53cf68b3-a880-45d5-a69b-f2e40dde3d37.png)\r\n2.

<code>useDrag::spec.begin</code> method.</p>\n<h2>14.0.1</h2>\n<h2>Patch</h2>\n<p>Update internal hook <code>useDragType()</code> to align with updated typings. Check 14.0.0 release for API changes</p>\n<h2>14.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release addresses a handful of nagging liveness and ergonomic issues with the hooks API.</p>\n<p>The liveness issues affect all hooks, and were discovered on deeper inspection of certain stress tests in the documentation. The internal <code>useCollector()</code> hook is used to collect props from the DnD system when <em>things change</em>. Prior to this update, we subscribed to updates from the DnD monitor to trigger prop collection. However, state on <em>the react side</em> was only accounted for on the first render. This release improves that liveness by collecting props whenever react state changes.</p>\n<p>The ergonomics of the <code>useDrag</code> have been refactored. In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>spec.type</code> is required</li>\n<li><code>spec.item</code> can be a function or static object.</li>\n<li>The function version of <code>spec.item</code> replaces <code>spec.begin</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the release of the hooks API, we packed <code>type</code> under <code>spec.item</code>. However, this led to nonintuitive situations where an <code>item</code> field was required to be specified even though items are created in the <code>begin</code> method.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the original React-DnD design, <code>beginDrag()</code> was optional and the <strong>type</strong> of the draggables had to be defined. If no explicit DragObject was created, an implicit object was created by the system..</p>\n<p>The change we've made here decouples <code>type</code> from <code>item</code>, and collapses <code>begin</code> into <code>item</code>.</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// Pre-v14\nuseDrag({\n   // item defined here to get a type\n   item: { type: BOX } },\n   // ...but the actual item is created here\n   begin: () =&gt; ({ id })\n})\n<p>// v14\nuseDrag({\ntype: BOX,\nitem: () =&gt; ({id})\n})\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR will make sure Superset can still lookup the db engine by engine alias when failed to locate installed dialect by engine name.\r\n\r\nTake db2 for example, It still uses legacy name `ibm_db_sa` within the SQLAlchemy dialect for Db2 while it has start to use latest name `db2` when connecting to Db2 via SQLAlchemy connection URL. So if using engine name `db2` only, it will not list Db2 as available databases from API `GET /api/v1/database/available`. This PR will fix this case.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Install SQLAlchemy dialect for db2 by running `pip3 install apache-superset[db2]`\r\n2. Follow reproduce step of #16796\r\n3. Make sure `IBM Db2` is listed under supported databases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

Update Spanish translations\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSpanish translations were largely updated including many of them that were dangerously inaccurate or incorrect, such like translating \"delete\" as indeed the opposite \"create\" which obviously would be catastrophic in many situations.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe Spanish language has many linguistic variants depending on factors such as geographic region. These translations aim to be as neutral as possible. It might be still far from perfect, however there were largely incomplete and many of them severely inaccurate (even translating to the exact opposite meaning!) \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [X] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen searching for charts/dashboards/datasets we're currently getting an error if the needle has a plus symbol, eg, `/w+`. This happens because the `+` is not escaped, and gets sent as a space to the backend. Because the string `/w ` is not valid rison, the search fails.\r\n\r\nI fixed by explicitly encoding `+`. We could use `encodeURIComponent`, but it encodes more than is needed and pollutes the URL.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-21 at 13-12-51  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/134241600-5de285dd-8631-4584-b7ad-67ffd03b393c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-09-21 at 14-14-47  DEV  Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/134248702-61daa10c-9cfc-49e7-a70b-9c73d6e3506e.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis adds `set -eu` to the init script. With this the script will exit immediately when it encounters an error or an unset variable.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIn order to test that this works you will need a k8s environment. One way to test this is to manually add an error into the init script by including an invalid command (just make sure that the last command in the script is still a working command). Then start a helm deployment. Without this PR the init job will be marked as success despite the error. With this PR applied the init job will be marked as failed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #16757\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS\r\nI personally think failing when an error occurs should be the default behavior. However, I could see that some people might prefer it if the script does not fail and instead tries the remaining init steps. If this is wanted I could add a flag to the init config in `values.yaml` so that users can easily select the behavior they want. Let me know if this is wanted or if this PR is ok as it is. I personally don't really think it's worth including a switch, because with the current behavior you would need to read the whole init job logs in order to know if there were any problems.","created_at":"2021-09-21T10:58:40Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T16:32:02Z","closed_at":"2021-09-27T02:16:27Z","merged_at":"2021-09-27T02:16:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef954585477aff36edbbf06ce88ec1b95ed53132","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

class `UploadToDatabaseForm(DynamicForm)` with all the repeated boilerplate and then extend those into class `CsvToDatabaseForm(UploadToDatabaseForm)`, class `ExcelToDatabaseForm(UploadToDatabaseForm)` etc.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWatch CI and any suggestions from reviewers\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFixes #16046 \r\n- [x] Has

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the percentage compare post processing operation is using the following formula\r\n```\r\nchange = (new - old) / new\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the correct formula should most likely

SUMMARY\r\nWhat's been done:\r\n\r\n- Bump webpack from 4.42.0 to 5.52.1\r\n- Bump webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, plugins and loaders to latest versions\r\n- Remove redundant plugins and loaders\r\n- Refactor webpack config file according to the migration guide (https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/) and bumped plugins changelogs\r\n- Replace url-loaders and file-loaders with Asset Modules\r\n- Replace mathjs with math-expression-evaluator. Mathjs was causing an import error, but we've been using it in only 1 component (AnnotationLayer), so I replaced it instead of investigating the error. Pulling an 11MB lib just to parse 1 expression was a waste anyway\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n\r\n- Bump other plugins (especially those marked by dependabot to be security vulnerabilities)\r\n- Attempt to simplify our webpack config file - it's quite complex and some parts of it might be unnecessary\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nno visual changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Everything should build like before\r\n2. The whole app should work like before - verify that images, fonts, libs are getting loaded properly and there are no runtime errors anywhere\r\n3. Linking superset-ui libraries should work like before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nEvery time control state is updated on the Explore view, the data panel requests new data, even when the changes are known not to affect the chart data (`renderTrigger` property set to `true`). This PR changes `ExploreChartPanel` to only refresh the `queryFormData` that's used by `DataTablesPane` if the `triggerRender` prop is not `true` (is falsy when a query has been issued). This only happens when the chart needs to be rerendered without rerequesting data.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/133247836-fb2b540a-824e-4521-93a6-c5c70852ef4c.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/133246743-4139d0f7-40ac-47d1-84b0-bf3aa1139713.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWith SIP-40 and SIP-41 we introduced an error handler to Flask to format exceptions in a standard JSON payload. One problem with this approach is that users are seeing JSON payloads in production when a generic error occurs.\r\n\r\nWe already had some logic to show a nice 404/500 page when catching an `HTTPException` error. I extended the logic to uncaught exceptions as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nWIP, still haven't been able to trigger an error.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nWe used some features from [HTML5 Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Using_the_Performance_API) to track dashboard page load performance. After we started to use SPA to generate and soft navigate between pages, \"navigation\" is any subsequent route change. Performance API's start point is based on `onload` event, so if user switch between chart list, dash list and dashboard (these pages are built from SPA structure), the old measurement for dashboard page load time is not accurate anymore.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses location to detect soft navigation and reset logging time start point.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**BEFORE

SUMMARY\r\nThe goal of this PR is to solve the known issues of the new Antd-based Select component, as follows:\r\n\r\n- When showSearch is ON and labels are customized with JSX, the Select can only search by value. For instance, Explore - Customise - COLOR SCHEME - Search for airbnb - won‚Äôt work - Will only work with searching bnb as the value used is bnbColors\r\n- When using labels with custom JSX the rendered HTML is showing label=[Object, Object]\r\n- Write a string, then delete it entirely. The string is still there and selected\r\n- With allowNewOptions true, type a non-existent option, then delete it char by char. Not the entire string is deleted.\r\n- When trying to create a new option, but the search is returning matching options, you won‚Äôt be able to create the new option, as the Select will instead pick the first matching option\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nThis is the first in a series of multiple PRs that aims to add generic x-axis support. The long-term goal is the following:\r\n- deprecate `is_timeseries` - a plugin should explicitly add the temporal column to the groupby if it is used as a dimension. This behavior is not changed in this PR, but removes the need for enabling `is_timeseries` to be able to limit series count.\r\n- deprecate `timeseries_limit` and `timeseries_limit_metric` with `series_columns`, `series_limit` and `series_limit_metric`.\r\n- Deprecate `groupby` in favor of `columns`.\r\n\r\nExisting charts should not be affected - legacy charts will work as before, but V1 charts will emit deprecation warnings when requesting data using the deprecated field names.\r\n\r\nRelated PR on `superset-ui`: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1356\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen sending a temporal Native Value Filter to a chart with a `DATE` column, the query errors out. This is due all temporal filters being encoded as `datetime.datetime` objects, irrespective of the target column being `DATE`, `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` (we handle formatting of the temporal value in `BaseEngineSpec.convert_dttm`). This error is due to the SqlAlchemy `Date` and `Datetime` column types not being able to handle `datetime` and `date` objects respectively.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the SqlAlchemy `Date` type with `DateTime`, making it compatible with the logic in `sqla/models.py`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/132498010-79fddec4-4d76-4fd3-a2ab-bc289dbf2f2e.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/132498160-b35c03f8-f927-47c3-8760-2d492f534564.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/132498177-1898cebc-06bc-43b0-8a45-c6fd53dc15cf.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. create a chart from a datasource that has a temporal column with `DATE` type\r\n2. Add it to a dashboard and create a Value Filter referencing the `DATE` column\r\n3. Emit a filter\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated
