addition to Airflow being timezone aware, this PR handles formatting datetime in the UI. \r\n\r\nThis PR **does not** modify the timestamps to that of the users current time - instead translates the servers UTC timestamps to readable format(s). \r\n\r\nThis project is split about 50/50 between a new `wwwutils` def:\r\n```python\r\ndef localized_f(attr_name):\r\n    def dt(attr):\r\n        f = attr.get(attr_name)\r\n        if f is None:\r\n            return Markup('<time datetime=\"{}\">{}</time>').format(f, f)\r\n        else:\r\n            f = f.strftime(date_format)\r\n            return Markup('<time datetime=\"{}\">{}</time>').format(f, f)\r\n    return dt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd 2 new global javascript funcs in `static/base.js`:\r\n```js\r\nexport function localizedDate(date) {\r\n  const locale = window.navigator.userLanguage || window.navigator.language;\r\n  if (date) return moment(date).locale(locale).format('LLL');\r\n  return '';\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function localizedTime(time) {\r\n  const locale = window.navigator.userLanguage || window.navigator.language;\r\n  if (time) return moment(time).locale(locale).format('LTS');\r\n  return '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviews (with different locales; english, french, german):\r\n<img width=\"351\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-11 at 4 46 09 PM\"

a new `load_default_connections` in the Core configuration of Airflow, similar to `load_examples` but aimed at avoiding the creation of default Connections in `airflow/utils/db.py`.\r\n\r\nBy default it is retrocompatible: \r\n\r\n  * the default behaviour is the old behaviour (`True`)\r\n  * the old behaviour is also kept in the CI tests and other places were configuration is used\r\n\r\nThe config is documented as being new in 1.10.10 (the current version being built using `master`).\r\n\r\nSee also in the Helm charts project, concerning the stable/airflow chart:\r\n\r\n>
