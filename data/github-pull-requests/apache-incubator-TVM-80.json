the Lower API is bifurcated. There is an implementation in Python and an implementation in C++. Both are used in the codebase despite having different signatures and different implementations. This PR unifies the C++ and Python API into one C++ backend, and allows the C++ API to be called from Python through the FFI. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Python version of the API relied on duck typing quite a bit, which made it difficult to fully support the Python API. To allow the C++ backend to fully replace the Python version of lower, @electriclilies had to write three different versions of Lower: LowerModule, LowerPrimFunc, and LowerSchedule, as well as make other changes. \r\n\r\nThe major changes to the C++ API are: \r\n\r\n1, Implementing versions of Lower for Modules, PrimFuncs and Schedules\r\n2. Adding user-defined passes to the C++ version\r\n3. Overload LowerSchedule to take in an Array<ObjectRef> for the arguments. The Python version accepts a List[Union[Buffer, Tensor, Var]] for the args. Unfortunately, the TVM object system does not allow union types, so Lily had to allow LowerSchedule to take in an Array<ObjectRef> for the args and raise an error if something other than a Buffer, Tensor or Var is passed in\r\n4. Removing SchedulePostProcForTensorCore (this is deadcode, it was used in one tutorial that has since been deleted and causes errors if called in certain cases)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Lily moved the python version of get_binds into C++ and exposed it through the FFI. Lily also renamed form_irmodule to schedule_to_module and moved that into C++. Finally, this refactor was a bit painful. @electriclilies will write a discussion post to go through why it was difficult and what can be changed to avoid issues like this in the future.","created_at":"2021-05-21T22:52:22Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T16:55:54Z","closed_at":"2021-06-12T13:57:39Z","merged_at":"2021-06-12T13:57:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9dd1286e91b679568fd161126924b03115fab724","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/794c606f6e7345167e7f06d1c04186fc00c9b638","head":{"label":"CircleSpin:lower_build","ref":"lower_build","sha":"794c606f6e7345167e7f06d1c04186fc00c9b638","user":{"login":"CircleSpin","id":19177012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc3MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19177012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin","html_url":"https://github.com/CircleSpin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333564440,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzM1NjQ0NDA=","name":"tvm","full_name":"CircleSpin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CircleSpin","id":19177012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc3MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19177012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin","html_url":"https://github.com/CircleSpin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CircleSpin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CircleSpin/tvm","description":"Open

For example, an error occurs in the shape func for `squeeze` that follows `gather_dim`, at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/55a4430f507d801b7441e60d00f06c8161aea30a/python/tvm/relay/op/_transform.py#L772. That line is a python range for loop that expects the rank of a shape tensor, `inputs[0].shape[0].value`, to be a compile time fixed integer. But if the rank of the `gather_dim` output tensor is calculated like above, the rank would not be a compile time integer (because it depends on the runtime value of shape).\r\n\r\nMy workaround for this problem is based on the fact that the first axis of `indices` tensor, whose runtime size is required to compute the output rank, is actually a compile time constant as asserted at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/55a4430f507d801b7441e60d00f06c8161aea30a/src/relay/op/tensor/transform.cc#L3347-L3348. So I simply record this fixed value in the attribute dict and look it up inside shape func. To do this, I had to add a new attribute to `gather_dim`, which is a bit ad hoc but necessary.","created_at":"2021-05-21T08:57:16Z","updated_at":"2021-05-30T03:06:23Z","closed_at":"2021-05-30T03:06:22Z","merged_at":"2021-05-30T03:06:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"27e44eee21bb65c0ef897799355084944c863aec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/06ac2052ab843be950ff3abf6ce8d52803adc5e5","head":{"label":"masahi:gather_nd_shape_func","ref":"gather_nd_shape_func","sha":"06ac2052ab843be950ff3abf6ce8d52803adc5e5","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138661036,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2NjEwMzY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"masahi/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masahi/tvm","description":"Open

unique operator in TVM did not match the ONNX output. In this PR, I make changes to Unique so that the 1D ONNX unit tests passes. The changes are:\r\n\r\n- Correcting the documentation and order of return values in Relay code, topi code and in testing code. The documentation currently says that TVM's unique op returns `indices`, which is \r\n\r\n    _\"A 1-D tensor. The same size as output. For each entry in output, it contains the index of its first occurance in the input data. The end of the tensor is padded with the length of the input data\"._ \r\n\r\n    However, the op was actually returning `inverse_indices`, which is:\r\n\r\n    _\"A 1-D tensor. For each entry in data, it contains the index of that data element in the unique array.\"_ \r\n\r\n    To fix this, I renamed `indices` as `inverse_indices` and updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n- Adding `indices` (the correct version) as an output to Unique\r\n- Adding Unique to the ONNX importer\r\n- Fixing a bug in the ONNX importer which caused ops with multiple optional outputs to not import\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart Please take a

flag\r\n'--output-format mlf'. For instance:\r\n\r\n$ python3 -m tvm.driver.tvmc compile ./sine_model.tflite --target=\"c\" --output sine.tar --output-format mlf\r\n\r\nwill generate a sine.tar archive that is serialized accordingly to the\r\nMLF.\r\n\r\nSince the MLF is currently meant to be used only on micro targets, an\r\nerror is generated if one tries to run a MLF outside a micro context:\r\n\r\n$ python3 -m tvm.driver.tvmc run ./sine.tar\r\nError: You're trying to run a model saved using the Model Library Format (MLF).

PR adds Model Library Format support to artifacts created by `tvm.build`. It introduces a `style` key to the Model Library Format metadata with two initial values: \r\n - `full-model`\r\n - `operator`\r\n\r\nImplementations that use Model Library Format will now need to check `style` before reading other files in the archive. `full-model` indicates the previously-used format.\r\n\r\n`operator` is introduced to allow exporting TVM libraries that contain only operator functions with no model-level information (e.g. executor configuration, model-wide memory planning, etc). The goal of `operator` style is to allow exporting fragments of models (e.g. individual TVM operators) for use with the TVM RPC Server. After the Project API refactor lands, TVM auto-tuning will produce MLF in `operator` style, and those MLF archives will be given to project generators with the ultimate goal of flashing and timing those operators on-device.\r\n\r\n MLF archives with `operator` style contain:\r\n - `codegen` directory, organized as in `full-model`\r\n - `metadata.json` of the same format as `full-model` with different values.\r\n - `src/tir-<device_type>.txt`, containing pretty-printed TIR\r\n\r\nNotably, the `memory` key in `metadata.json` contains shape information for each operator function parameter. The shape information has names correlated with those used in the TIR sources in `src/tir-*.txt`.\r\n\r\n@leandron @manupa-arm @giuseros @Mousius @gromero @mehrdadh

implements a pass to convert an fp32 relay graph into an fp16 version. The RFC is described [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-relay-fp32-fp16-model-support/9994/).\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Add pass and unittests\r\n- Make DataType hashable via std::hash (it is kind of slow though). (include/tvm/runtime/data_type.h)\r\n- Fix a bug with conv2d not working with accumulation_dtypes different than inputs (python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSome unittests.\r\n\r\n**Models tested (onnx):**\r\nImage Classification\r\n- Densenet (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- Resnet18 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- EfficientNet-4 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- InceptionV3 (Converted from torchvision.models)\r\n\r\nObject Detection\r\n- Tinyyolov2 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- Yolov2 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- Yolov4 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- SSD-resnet34 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n\r\nEmbedding Models\r\n- Arcface (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- RFB-face (https://github.com/onnx/models) \r\n\r\nSuper resolution:\r\n- Some random super resolution model (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n\r\nNLP:\r\n- GPT-2 (https://github.com/onnx/models)\r\n- DistillBert (Converted from HuggingFace's transformers lib)\r\n\r\n**Models tested (relay native):**\r\n- ResNet18\r\n- ResNet18-3D\r\n- Densenet\r\n- LSTM (unrolled)\r\n- Squeezenet\r\n- Mobilenet\r\n\r\nBy tested I mean I confirm it did some transformation on the graph and a forward pass could be run on CPU and matches the fp32 output somewhat. I have nothing on performance metrics or other devices yet.\r\n\r\n### Future PRs (in order of priority)\r\n1. Show this actually leads to speedups!\r\n2. Make the coloring function and output_dtype/accumulation_dtype functions extensible via Python \r\n3. An extensive audit of existing relay ops into the coloring lists.\r\n4. Write a pass to fold unnecessary casts e.g. cast(fp16) --> cast(fp32) --> cast(fp16) can probably just be one cast(fp16)\r\n5. Rename the colors into something less generic and easily confused for something else\r\n6. Rewrite the signature of functions automatically (right now everything is kept in fp32 and internal to the function things are cast)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n- Right now the pass will mutate nodes in the original relay graph\r\n\r\ncc @mbrookhart , @csullivan please take a look and add relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n### Speedups (add as I go along)\r\nBERT w/ input shape [1, 128] on M1 Mac (based on https://github.com/octoml/Apple-M1-BERT) and 10000 tuning trials:\r\n\r\nFP32 version - Mean inference time (std dev): 107.82 ms (3.39 ms)\r\nFP16 version - Mean inference time (std dev): 80.04 ms (6.19 ms)\r\n\r\n~25% speedup! \r\n\r\nYolov2 (https://github.com/onnx/models)  w/ 10000  tuning trials on M1  Mac\r\nFP32 version - Mean inference time (std dev): 112.21 (3.75 ms)\r\nFP16 version - Mean inference time (std dev): 71.05 ms (4.04 ms)\r\n\r\n~36% speedup!

PR relaxes the constraint that `begin`, `end` and `strides` params of dynamic strided slice to have the same length as input rank, and enable slicing on only first few axes (in particular, slicing along batch dim only). \r\n\r\nFor example, the output shape of ONNX NMS is `(num_detection, 3)`. However, when translated to relay, it becomes `(?, ?)`, since current dynamic stride slice always slices on all axes, even if some axes are conceptually static. This posed a problem when `GatherND` is applied to the output of ONNX NMS, since it requires the second dimension to be static:

all instances of `_get_list_param` have a fallback to use `infer_value` to get a static list, or if they didn't they could only benefit from it. This PR moves that code inside `_get_list_param` so it will be used by all ops using `_get_list_param`.\r\n\r\nThis is helpful for strided_slice because it didn't have the `infer_value` fallback which was causing an error for some models I was trying to compile.","created_at":"2021-05-14T21:21:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T21:25:35Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T21:25:25Z","merged_at":"2021-05-18T21:25:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"93f301059308d8d9fc85e892cd018a08c1a5d2d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c1321b99c733abe28185d2497569704277aab177","head":{"label":"trevor-m:infer-value-list-param","ref":"infer-value-list-param","sha":"c1321b99c733abe28185d2497569704277aab177","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds a uniform distribution generator using the  threefry PRNG introduced in #7083. We would need uniform to develop the training phase dropout as the following roadmap:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuniform -> bernoulli -> dropout\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is basically the same as the one used in jax: using the random bits generated from `threefry_generate` as the fraction section of the float32 or float64. To be specific, I use the last 23 bits of the random bits for float32 and last 52 for float64. There is one different from the jax implementation. In jax, they used a bitcast to turn uint into float:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# jax implementation\r\ndef _uniform(key, shape, dtype, minval, maxval) -> jnp.ndarray:\r\n  ...\r\n  bits = _random_bits(key, nbits, shape)\r\n\r\n  # The strategy here is to randomize only the mantissa bits with an exponent of\r\n  # 1 (after applying the bias), then shift and scale to the desired range. The\r\n  # bit-level transformation we use relies on Numpy and XLA having bit-for-bit\r\n  # equivalent float representations, which might not be true on all platforms.\r\n  float_bits = lax.bitwise_or(\r\n      lax.shift_right_logical(bits, np.array(nbits - nmant, lax.dtype(bits))),\r\n      np.array(1., dtype).view(_UINT_DTYPES[nbits]))\r\n  floats = lax.bitcast_convert_type(float_bits, dtype) - np.array(1., dtype)\r\n  return lax.max(\r\n      minval,\r\n      lax.reshape(floats * (maxval - minval) + minval, shape.positional))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, as I haven't found the bitcast in te or topi, I use a divide to cast the type, which may be slower:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def uniform_scalar(bits):\r\n        bits = bits >> (nbits - nfraction)\r\n        standard_uniform = bits.astype(out_dtype) / float(1 << nfraction)\r\n        return standard_uniform\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for your time on reviewing this PR.

edgetpus.","created_at":"2021-05-13T03:43:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T09:51:34Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T19:38:38Z","merged_at":"2021-05-14T19:38:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"3bf65b7753e92b49cb736b20151c32fd33f5f52f","assignee":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6eae025f931be7f61769e653f8078e5f6c27d689","head":{"label":"tk1012:fix_edgetpu_runtime","ref":"fix_edgetpu_runtime","sha":"6eae025f931be7f61769e653f8078e5f6c27d689","user":{"login":"tk1012","id":4142099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDIwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4142099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012","html_url":"https://github.com/tk1012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tk1012/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"c999a840cb5579c493f5b5e7f20bc619260dad08","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","u

PR implements the RFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-rename-gpu-to-cuda/9928. The main purpose is to clearly distinguish between the general GPU devices and CUDA-enabled GPUs by renaming some `gpu` to `cuda` in the codebase.\r\n\r\n- [DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack) has recently done such [renaming](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/issues/67), so this PR bumps dlpack to v0.5.\r\n- The API `tvm.gpu(0)` is changed to `tvm.cuda(0)`, but we keep the old `tvm.gpu()` API for another release cycle.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @junrushao1994

on the discussions in [the AOT embedded improvements RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-utvm-aot-optimisations-for-embedded-targets/9849), this adds a flag to the target which changes the internal operators to an unpacked API. The unpacked API spreads the input buffers across the operator function, for example:\r\n```\r\nint32_t operator(void* arg0, void* arg1);\r\n```\r\nAs opposed to the traditional packed API:\r\n```\r\nint32_t operator(void** args);\r\n```\r\nUnaffected is the entrypoint function, which retains a packed API for compatibility with other parts of TVM. The entrypoint function is generated as part of the metadata as suggested by @tqchen so we can easily swap it for implementing `--micro-entrypoint`. \r\n\r\ncc: @giuseros @mbaret @manupa-arm @areusch

current alter_op function for `strided_slice` ends up recasting `begin` and `end` to `Int32` due that being the default dtype of new `Integer`s. However, some frontends like Onnx use the max value of `int64` to represent getting the all values along an axis. This max value gets miscast to `-1` when converted to Int32, which leads to shape mismatches. This PR fixes the issue. I also ran into one totally unrelated issue in `conv2d` alter_op where padding was being checked incorrectly and snuck that into this PR since its pretty tiny.","created_at":"2021-05-11T23:26:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:54:49Z","closed_at":"2021-05-13T16:26:28Z","merged_at":"2021-05-13T16:26:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"c999a840cb5579c493f5b5e7f20bc619260dad08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/986ca73f7e5359f87484424c5a6497f2ed269c9b","head":{"label":"jwfromm:alter_op_fix","ref":"alter_op_fix","sha":"986ca73f7e5359f87484424c5a6497f2ed269c9b","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

the AoT executor uses the stack-based allocator to allocate tensors within the provided workspace buffer. This bit of work ties up the calculated workspace size to create the correctly sized buffer to be used with stack-based allocator + AoT executor. Moreover, certain hardware platforms require the addresses of tensors to be byte aligned, thus this PR adds support for optional workspace-byte-alignment option to states that while defaulting to 1.\r\n\r\n* This commit adds byte alignment support for workspaces\r\n* Updating AoT tests to use calculate workspaces\r\n\r\ncc: @giuseros @Mousius @areusch

(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c7b54a196e1363cbe43122f01a728cd71fa1686a).  \r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue locally one can use following publicly available network https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-zoo/blob/master/models/keyword_spotting/ds_cnn_small/tflite_int8/ds_cnn_s_quantized.tflite\r\nCommand line:\r\n`tvmc compile --target llvm ds_cnn_s_quantized.tflite `\r\nwill fail in attempt to perform `combineMul ` on `t20: v12i32 = mul nsw t19, t6` due to missing MVT of v6i32 (which in fact should be EVT, not MVT) on llvm versions prior

the moment compiling this file throws multiple errors with C++ compilers, this change proposes to fix them.\r\n1. `tvm_model_t->run_func` of type `TVMBackedPackedFunc` returns an int at the moment which is different from the signature of this function `tvm_runtime_run`, implicit casting is not favorable in many compile chains and throws errors.\r\n2. The index of iterators were of type `int` while that of `model->num_input_tensors` and `model->num_output_tensors` were of type `uint32_t`, this type difference again throws errors in many toolchains, and can potentially cause incorrect calculations.\r\n3. C Style struct initialization of tensors with `(DLTensor){...}` is not supported in many C++ toolchains and throws “non-trivial designated initializers not supported” error.
