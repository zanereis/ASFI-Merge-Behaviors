href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases\">actions/dependency-review-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>By default the action now expects <a href=\"https://spdx.org/licenses/\">SPDX-compliant licenses</a> everywhere. If you were previously using license names in the allow or deny lists make sure they're valid!</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>Support for external configuration files</h3>\n<p>You can now specify a <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/#configuration-file\">configuration file external to your repository</a>. This allows organizations to have a single configuration file for all their repos.</p>\n<h3>Broader license support</h3>\n<p>We've added support for a much broader set of project licenses by using GitHub's <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses\">Licenses API</a>.</p>\n<h3>SPDX Compliance</h3>\n<p>All of our license-related code now expects <a href=\"https://spdx.org/licenses/\">SPDX-compliant licenses or expressions</a>. This allows us to standardize on a license naming scheme that already supports <code>OR</code>/<code>AND</code> expressions.</p>\n<h3>Disable individual checks</h3>\n<p>You can now use the boolean options <code>license-check</code> and <code>vulnerability-check</code> to disable either one of the checks. More information in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/#configuration-options\">our configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n<p>Contributors for this release include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cnagadya\"><code>@​cnagadya</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/courtneycl\"><code>@​courtneycl</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ericcornelissen\"><code>@​ericcornelissen</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elireisman\"><code>@​elireisman</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hmaurer\"><code>@​hmaurer</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks everyone!\n<strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v2...v3.0.0\">https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v2...v3.0.0</a></p>\n<h2>2.5.1</h2>\n<p>Adding some quality-of-life improvements to the local development experience. You can now pass a flag to the <code>scripts/scan_pr</code> script using the <code>-c/--config-file</code> flags to use an external configuration file:</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>  scripts/scan_pr https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/294\n</code></pre>\n<h2>2.5.0</h2>\n<p>Fallback on GitHub Licenses API data for missing Dependency Review API Licenses. This should improve our license coverage.</p>\n<h2>2.4.1</h2>\n<p>This patch release fixes the bugs below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display the dependency name instead of the manifest name in the detailed list of dependents.</li>\n<li>Fix an issue where undefined GHSAs would remove filter out all changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Fix Aliyun OSS storage upload_object KeyError: 'ETag' issue\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nDistributor ID:\tUbuntu\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu 22.04.1 LTS\r\nRelease:\t22.04\r\nCodename:\tjammy\r\nPython:         3.9.12\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install apache-libcloud\r\n# apache-libcloud-3.6.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.providers import get_driver\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.types import Provider\r\n\r\nkey='your key'\r\nsecret='your secret'\r\noss_endpoint='oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com'\r\noss_region='cn-hangzhou'\r\nbucket_name='your bucket'\r\nsource='/path/to/source'\r\ntarget='/path/to/target'\r\n\r\ncls = get_driver(Provider.ALIYUN_OSS)\r\ndriver = cls(key, secret, host=oss_endpoint, region=oss_region)\r\ncontainer=driver.get_container(bucket_name)\r\nobj=container.upload_object(source, target)\r\nprint(obj)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code will have below output on my computer:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/libcloud/storage/base.py\", line 203, in upload_object\r\n    return self.driver.upload_object(\r\n  File

Changes\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that when sending uploading requests to OSS, the bucket name cannot be inserted into the url, for example, the final url should be like `https://your-bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/...`, but the current code will send a request with `https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/...`, then the bucket information will not be included in the `upload_object` function.\r\n\r\nBelow is what I change:\r\n1. Add a `container` argument in the `_upload_object` function and pass `container` to the request.\r\n2. Use `.upper()` when comparing the `data_hash` and `server_hash` to avoid hash mismatch\r\n\r\nNote that the changes only happen in the `libcloud/storage/drivers/oss.py` in my latest pull request.\r\n\r\nChinese document:

secret'\r\noss_endpoint='oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com'\r\noss_region='cn-hangzhou'\r\nbucket_name='your bucket'\r\nsource='/path/to/source'\r\ntarget='/path/to/target'\r\n\r\ncls = get_driver(Provider.ALIYUN_OSS)\r\ndriver = cls(key, secret, host=oss_endpoint, region=oss_region)\r\ncontainer=driver.get_container(bucket_name)\r\nobj=container.upload_object(source, target)\r\nprint(obj)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code will have below output on my computer:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/libcloud/storage/base.py\", line 203, in upload_object\r\n    return self.driver.upload_object(\r\n  File \"/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/libcloud/storage/drivers/oss.py\", line 454, in upload_object\r\n    return self._put_object(\r\n  File \"/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/libcloud/storage/drivers/oss.py\", line 642, in _put_object\r\n    server_hash = headers[\"etag\"].replace('\"', \"\")\r\nKeyError: 'etag'\r\n```\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that when sending uploading requests to OSS, the bucket name cannot be inserted into the url, for example, the final url should be like `https://your-bucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/...`, but the current code will send a request with `https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/...`, then the bucket information will not be included in the `upload_object` function.\r\n\r\nBelow is what I change:\r\n1. Add a `container` argument in the `_upload_object` function.\r\n2. Use `.upper()` when comparing the `data_hash` and `server_hash` to avoid hash mismatch\r\n\r\nChinese document:

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10012\">#10012</a>: Update <code>pytest.PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} to a deprecation; it will raise an error in pytest 8.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10396\">#10396</a>: pytest no longer depends on the <code>py</code> library. <code>pytest</code> provides a vendored copy of <code>py.error</code> and <code>py.path</code> modules but will use the <code>py</code> library if it is installed. If you need other <code>py.*</code> modules, continue to install the deprecated <code>py</code> library separately, otherwise it can usually be removed as a dependency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4562\">#4562</a>: Deprecate configuring hook specs/impls using attributes/marks.</p>\n<p>Instead use :py<code>pytest.hookimpl</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} and :py<code>pytest.hookspec</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.\nFor more details, see the <code>docs &lt;legacy-path-hooks-deprecated&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9886\">#9886</a>: The functionality for running tests written for <code>nose</code> has been officially deprecated.</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plain <code>setup</code> and <code>teardown</code> functions and methods: this might catch users by surprise, as <code>setup()</code> and <code>teardown()</code> are not pytest idioms, but part of the <code>nose</code> support.</li>\n<li>Setup/teardown using the <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/HEAD/with-setup-nose\"><code>@​with_setup</code></a> decorator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details, consult the <code>deprecation docs &lt;nose-deprecation&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9897\">#9897</a>: Added shell-style wildcard support to <code>testpaths</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10218\">#10218</a>: <code>@pytest.mark.parametrize()</code> (and similar functions) now accepts any <code>Sequence[str]</code> for the argument names,\ninstead of just <code>list[str]</code> and <code>tuple[str, ...]</code>.</p>\n<p>(Note that <code>str</code>, which is itself a <code>Sequence[str]</code>, is still treated as a\ncomma-delimited name list, as before).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10381\">#10381</a>: The <code>--no-showlocals</code> flag has been added. This can be passed directly to tests to override <code>--showlocals</code> declared through <code>addopts</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3426\">#3426</a>: Assertion failures with strings in NFC and NFD forms that normalize to the same string now have a dedicated error message detailing the issue, and their utf-8 representation is expresed instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337\">#7337</a>: A warning is now emitted if a test function returns something other than [None]{.title-ref}. This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a [bool]{.title-ref} (for example [return foo(a, b) == result]{.title-ref}) would cause a test to pass or fail, instead of using [assert]{.title-ref}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8508\">#8508</a>: Introduce multiline display for warning matching via :py<code>pytest.warns</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} and\nenhance match comparison for :py<code>_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo.match</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} as returned by :py<code>pytest.raises</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8646\">#8646</a>: Improve :py<code>pytest.raises</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}. Previously passing an empty tuple would give a confusing\nerror.

Partially restore old initial batch distribution algorithm in <code>LoadScheduling</code>.</p>\n<p>pytest orders tests for optimal sequential execution - i. e. avoiding\nunnecessary setup and teardown of fixtures. So executing tests in consecutive\nchunks is important for optimal performance.</p>\n<p>In v1.14, initial test distribution in <code>LoadScheduling</code> was changed to\nround-robin, optimized for the corner case, when the number of tests is less\nthan <code>2 * number of nodes</code>. At the same time, it became worse for all other\ncases.</p>\n<p>For example: if some tests use some &quot;heavy&quot; fixture, and these tests fit into\nthe initial batch, with round-robin distribution the fixture will be created</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

length greater than 65535 bytes (typically\n  seen in large CRLs).\n<p>.. _v38-0-0:</p>\n<p>38.0.0 - 2022-09-06\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Final deprecation of OpenSSL 1.1.0. The next release of <code>cryptography</code>\nwill drop support.</li>\n<li>We no longer ship <code>manylinux2010</code> wheels. Users should upgrade to the\nlatest <code>pip</code> to ensure this doesn't cause issues downloading wheels on\ntheir platform. We now ship <code>manylinux_2_28</code> wheels for users on new\nenough platforms.</li>\n<li>Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.48.0, from 1.41.0.\nUsers with the latest <code>pip</code> will typically get a wheel and not need Rust\ninstalled, but check :doc:<code>/installation</code> for documentation on installing a\nnewer <code>rustc</code> if required.</li>\n<li>:meth:<code>~cryptography.fernet.Fernet.decrypt</code> and related methods now accept\nboth <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code> tokens.</li>\n<li>Parsing <code>CertificateSigningRequest</code> restores the behavior of enforcing\nthat the <code>Extension</code> <code>critical</code> field must be correctly encoded DER. See\n<code>the issue &lt;https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6368&gt;</code>_ for complete\ndetails.</li>\n<li>Added two new OpenSSL functions to the bindings to support an upcoming\n<code>pyOpenSSL</code> release.</li>\n<li>When parsing :class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList</code> and\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest</code> values, it is now\nenforced that the <code>version</code> value in the input must be valid according to\nthe rules of :rfc:<code>2986</code> and :rfc:<code>5280</code>.</li>\n<li>Using MD5 or SHA1 in :class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder</code> and\nother X.509 builders is deprecated and support will be removed in the next\nversion.</li>\n<li>Added additional APIs to\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.certificate_transparency.SignedCertificateTimestamp</code>, including\n:attr:<code>~cryptography.x509.certificate_transparency.SignedCertificateTimestamp.signature_hash_algorithm</code>,\n:attr:<code>~cryptography.x509.certificate_transparency.SignedCertificateTimestamp.signature_algorithm</code>,\n:attr:<code>~cryptography.x509.certificate_transparency.SignedCertificateTimestamp.signature</code>, and\n:attr:<code>~cryptography.x509.certificate_transparency.SignedCertificateTimestamp.extension_bytes</code>.</li>\n<li>Added :attr:<code>~cryptography.x509.Certificate.tbs_precertificate_bytes</code>, allowing\nusers to access the to-be-signed pre-certificate data needed for signed\ncertificate timestamp verification.</li>\n<li>:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.kbkdf.KBKDFHMAC</code> and\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.kbkdf.KBKDFCMAC</code> now support\n:attr:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.kbkdf.CounterLocation.MiddleFixed</code>\ncounter location.</li>\n<li>Fixed :rfc:<code>4514</code> name parsing to reverse the order of the RDNs according</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

(<code>pull 1405</code>_).  Thanks, Michael Krebs and Benjamin\nSchubert.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different\ndrive than the current directory. (<code>pull 1430</code><em>, fixing <code>issue 1428</code></em>).\nThanks, Lorenzo Micò.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in\na Docker container: <code>pull 1403</code>_, thanks Arthur Rio.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Filtering in the HTML report wouldn't work when reloading the index page.\nThis is now fixed (<code>pull 1413</code>_).  Thanks, Marc Legendre.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a problem with Cython code measurement (<code>pull 1347</code><em>, fixing <code>issue 972</code></em>).

This line cannnot be executed, so\ncoverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,\nbut this also means that truly empty modules (like <code>__init__.py</code>) have no\nlines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes <code>issue 1419</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to\navoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.

PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by

[coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) from 4.5.4 to 6.4.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/releases\">coverage's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>coverage-5.6b1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting. This solves a few problems:\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage will no longer report about other people’s code (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876\">issue 876</a>). This is true even when using <code>--source=.</code> with a venv in the current directory.</li>\n<li>Coverage will no longer generate “Already imported a file that will be measured” warnings about coverage itself (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905\">issue 905</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of code. They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior. Now the highlighting is working again.</li>\n<li>The JSON report now includes <code>percent_covered_display</code>, a string with the total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other reports’ totals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>coverage combine</code> has a new option, <code>--keep</code> to keep the original data files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files after they have been combined. This was requested in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108\">issue 1108</a> and implemented in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110\">pull request 1110</a>. Thanks, Éric Larivière.</li>\n<li>When reporting missing branches in <code>coverage report</code>, branches aren’t reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches are only reported if both the source and destination lines are executed. Closes both <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065\">issue 1065</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955\">issue 955</a>.</li>\n<li>Minor improvements to the HTML report:\n<ul>\n<li>The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage so you don’t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123\">issue 1123</a>.</li>\n<li>It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work well, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124\">issue 1124</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users will be more likely to understand what’s happening, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803\">issue 803</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The text report produced by <code>coverage report</code> now always outputs a TOTAL line, even if only one Python file is reported. This makes regex parsing of the output easier. Thanks, Judson Neer. This had been requested a number of times (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086\">issue 1086</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922\">issue 922</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732\">issue 732</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>skip_covered</code> and <code>skip_empty</code> settings in the configuration file can now be specified in the <code>[html]</code> section, so that text reports and HTML reports can use separate settings. The HTML report will still use the <code>[report]</code> settings if there isn’t a value in the <code>[html]</code> section. Closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090\">issue 1090</a>.</li>\n<li>Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577\">issue 577</a>. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080\">Valentin Lab</a>.</li>\n<li>Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084\">issue 1084</a>.</li>\n<li>Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/\">PEP 626: Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When using <code>--source</code> on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous versions. This performance regression is now fixed, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037\">issue 1037</a>.</li>\n<li>Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\">issue 1010</a>. An immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying solution.</li>\n<li>The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986\">issue 986</a>. Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066\">pull request 1066</a>).</li>\n<li>The HTML report pages now have a <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/HEAD/sleepy.rst#sleepy\">Sleepy Snake</a> favicon.</li>\n<li>Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).</li>\n<li>Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>source</code> setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a module, depending on which existed. If both interpretations were valid, it was assumed to be a file path. The new <code>source_pkgs</code> setting can be used to name a package to disambiguate this case. Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268\">issue 268</a>.</li>\n<li>If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record its information, causing an exception, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011\">issue 1011</a>. This is now fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The dark mode HTML report still used light colors for the context listing, making them unreadable (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1009\">issue 1009</a>). This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>The time stamp on the HTML report now includes the time zone. Thanks, Xie Yanbo (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/960\">pull request 960</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The HTML report has been redesigned by Vince Salvino.

[coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) from 4.5.4 to 6.4.3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/releases\">coverage's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>coverage-5.6b1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting. This solves a few problems:\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage will no longer report about other people’s code (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876\">issue 876</a>). This is true even when using <code>--source=.</code> with a venv in the current directory.</li>\n<li>Coverage will no longer generate “Already imported a file that will be measured” warnings about coverage itself (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905\">issue 905</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of code. They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior. Now the highlighting is working again.</li>\n<li>The JSON report now includes <code>percent_covered_display</code>, a string with the total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other reports’ totals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>coverage combine</code> has a new option, <code>--keep</code> to keep the original data files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files after they have been combined. This was requested in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108\">issue 1108</a> and implemented in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110\">pull request 1110</a>. Thanks, Éric Larivière.</li>\n<li>When reporting missing branches in <code>coverage report</code>, branches aren’t reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches are only reported if both the source and destination lines are executed. Closes both <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065\">issue 1065</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955\">issue 955</a>.</li>\n<li>Minor improvements to the HTML report:\n<ul>\n<li>The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage so you don’t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123\">issue 1123</a>.</li>\n<li>It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work well, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124\">issue 1124</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users will be more likely to understand what’s happening, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803\">issue 803</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The text report produced by <code>coverage report</code> now always outputs a TOTAL line, even if only one Python file is reported. This makes regex parsing of the output easier. Thanks, Judson Neer. This had been requested a number of times (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086\">issue 1086</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922\">issue 922</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732\">issue 732</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>skip_covered</code> and <code>skip_empty</code> settings in the configuration file can now be specified in the <code>[html]</code> section, so that text reports and HTML reports can use separate settings. The HTML report will still use the <code>[report]</code> settings if there isn’t a value in the <code>[html]</code> section. Closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090\">issue 1090</a>.</li>\n<li>Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577\">issue 577</a>. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080\">Valentin Lab</a>.</li>\n<li>Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084\">issue 1084</a>.</li>\n<li>Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/\">PEP 626: Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When using <code>--source</code> on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous versions. This performance regression is now fixed, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037\">issue 1037</a>.</li>\n<li>Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\">issue 1010</a>. An immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying solution.</li>\n<li>The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986\">issue 986</a>. Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066\">pull request 1066</a>).</li>\n<li>The HTML report pages now have a <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/HEAD/sleepy.rst#sleepy\">Sleepy Snake</a> favicon.</li>\n<li>Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).</li>\n<li>Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>source</code> setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a module, depending on which existed. If both interpretations were valid, it was assumed to be a file path. The new <code>source_pkgs</code> setting can be used to name a package to disambiguate this case. Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268\">issue 268</a>.</li>\n<li>If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record its information, causing an exception, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011\">issue 1011</a>. This is now fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The dark mode HTML report still used light colors for the context listing, making them unreadable (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1009\">issue 1009</a>). This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>The time stamp on the HTML report now includes the time zone. Thanks, Xie Yanbo (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/960\">pull request 960</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The HTML report has been redesigned by Vince Salvino. There is now a dark mode, the code text is larger, and system sans serif fonts are used, in addition to other small changes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/858\">issue 858</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/931\">pull request 931</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> and <code>coverage html</code> commands now accept a <code>--precision</code> option to control the number of decimal points displayed. Thanks, Teake Nutma (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/982\">pull request 982</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> and <code>coverage html</code> commands now accept a <code>--no-skip-covered</code> option to negate <code>--skip-covered</code>. Thanks, Anthony Sottile (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/779\">issue 779</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/932\">pull request 932</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>--skip-empty</code> option is now available for the XML report, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/976\">issue 976</a>.</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> command now accepts a <code>--sort</code> option to specify how to sort the results. Thanks, Jerin Peter George (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1005\">pull request 1005</a>).</li>\n<li>If coverage fails due to the coverage total not reaching the <code>--fail-under</code> value, it will now print a message making the condition clear. Thanks, Naveen Yadav (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/977\">pull request 977</a>).</li>\n<li>TOML configuration files with non-ASCII characters would cause errors on Windows (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/990\">issue 990</a>). This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>The output of <code>--debug=trace</code> now includes information about how the <code>--source</code> option is being interpreted, and the module names being considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The JSON report now includes counts of covered and missing branches.

Thanks, Michael Krebs and Benjamin\nSchubert.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different\ndrive than the current directory. (<code>pull 1430</code><em>, fixing <code>issue 1428</code></em>).\nThanks, Lorenzo Micò.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in\na Docker container: <code>pull 1403</code>_, thanks Arthur Rio.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Filtering in the HTML report wouldn't work when reloading the index page.\nThis is now fixed (<code>pull 1413</code>_).  Thanks, Marc Legendre.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a problem with Cython code measurement (<code>pull 1347</code><em>, fixing <code>issue 972</code></em>).

This line cannnot be executed, so\ncoverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,\nbut this also means that truly empty modules (like <code>__init__.py</code>) have no\nlines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes <code>issue 1419</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to\navoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.

This change adds a new parameter that allows passing zones as a list of strings. \r\nSome open questions for the maintainers:\r\n1. I have also merged the disk API versions because the `zones` parameter was only supported in newer API versions. I do not fully understand the impact of bumping the API versions, but if tests pass, I think it should be fine. Thoughts?\r\n2. The new API version also caused request and response payloads to differ i.e. the volume types are now passed as [DiskSku](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/disks/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP#disksku) objects instead of strings. How do we handle API changes? Is there documentation around making such API changes?\r\n\r\nI have tested the following disk operations:\r\n1. Create empty disks.\r\n2. Attach disks to a VM.\r\n3. Resize disks.\r\n4. Detach disks.\r\n5. List disks.\r\n6. Delete disks.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [x]

[coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) from 4.5.4 to 6.4.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/releases\">coverage's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>coverage-5.6b1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting. This solves a few problems:\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage will no longer report about other people’s code (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876\">issue 876</a>). This is true even when using <code>--source=.</code> with a venv in the current directory.</li>\n<li>Coverage will no longer generate “Already imported a file that will be measured” warnings about coverage itself (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905\">issue 905</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of code. They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior. Now the highlighting is working again.</li>\n<li>The JSON report now includes <code>percent_covered_display</code>, a string with the total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other reports’ totals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>coverage combine</code> has a new option, <code>--keep</code> to keep the original data files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files after they have been combined. This was requested in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108\">issue 1108</a> and implemented in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110\">pull request 1110</a>. Thanks, Éric Larivière.</li>\n<li>When reporting missing branches in <code>coverage report</code>, branches aren’t reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches are only reported if both the source and destination lines are executed. Closes both <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065\">issue 1065</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955\">issue 955</a>.</li>\n<li>Minor improvements to the HTML report:\n<ul>\n<li>The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage so you don’t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123\">issue 1123</a>.</li>\n<li>It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work well, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124\">issue 1124</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users will be more likely to understand what’s happening, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803\">issue 803</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The text report produced by <code>coverage report</code> now always outputs a TOTAL line, even if only one Python file is reported. This makes regex parsing of the output easier. Thanks, Judson Neer. This had been requested a number of times (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086\">issue 1086</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922\">issue 922</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732\">issue 732</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>skip_covered</code> and <code>skip_empty</code> settings in the configuration file can now be specified in the <code>[html]</code> section, so that text reports and HTML reports can use separate settings. The HTML report will still use the <code>[report]</code> settings if there isn’t a value in the <code>[html]</code> section. Closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090\">issue 1090</a>.</li>\n<li>Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577\">issue 577</a>. Thanks, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080\">Valentin Lab</a>.</li>\n<li>Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084\">issue 1084</a>.</li>\n<li>Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/\">PEP 626: Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When using <code>--source</code> on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous versions. This performance regression is now fixed, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037\">issue 1037</a>.</li>\n<li>Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\">issue 1010</a>. An immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying solution.</li>\n<li>The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way, fixing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986\">issue 986</a>. Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066\">pull request 1066</a>).</li>\n<li>The HTML report pages now have a <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/HEAD/sleepy.rst#sleepy\">Sleepy Snake</a> favicon.</li>\n<li>Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).</li>\n<li>Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>source</code> setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a module, depending on which existed. If both interpretations were valid, it was assumed to be a file path. The new <code>source_pkgs</code> setting can be used to name a package to disambiguate this case. Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268\">issue 268</a>.</li>\n<li>If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record its information, causing an exception, as reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011\">issue 1011</a>. This is now fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The dark mode HTML report still used light colors for the context listing, making them unreadable (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1009\">issue 1009</a>). This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>The time stamp on the HTML report now includes the time zone. Thanks, Xie Yanbo (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/960\">pull request 960</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The HTML report has been redesigned by Vince Salvino. There is now a dark mode, the code text is larger, and system sans serif fonts are used, in addition to other small changes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/858\">issue 858</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/931\">pull request 931</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> and <code>coverage html</code> commands now accept a <code>--precision</code> option to control the number of decimal points displayed. Thanks, Teake Nutma (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/982\">pull request 982</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> and <code>coverage html</code> commands now accept a <code>--no-skip-covered</code> option to negate <code>--skip-covered</code>. Thanks, Anthony Sottile (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/779\">issue 779</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/932\">pull request 932</a>).</li>\n<li>The <code>--skip-empty</code> option is now available for the XML report, closing <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/976\">issue 976</a>.</li>\n<li>The <code>coverage report</code> command now accepts a <code>--sort</code> option to specify how to sort the results. Thanks, Jerin Peter George (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1005\">pull request 1005</a>).</li>\n<li>If coverage fails due to the coverage total not reaching the <code>--fail-under</code> value, it will now print a message making the condition clear. Thanks, Naveen Yadav (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/977\">pull request 977</a>).</li>\n<li>TOML configuration files with non-ASCII characters would cause errors on Windows (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/990\">issue 990</a>). This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>The output of <code>--debug=trace</code> now includes information about how the <code>--source</code> option is being interpreted, and the module names being considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>coverage-5.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The JSON report now includes counts of covered and missing branches.

This line cannnot be executed, so\ncoverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,\nbut this also means that truly empty modules (like <code>__init__.py</code>) have no\nlines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes <code>issue 1419</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to\navoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.

These will be\nremoved again in the future, so <code>pyOpenSSL</code> users should still upgrade\nto the latest version of that package when they upgrade <code>cryptography</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v37-0-0:</p>\n<p>37.0.0 - 2022-04-26</p>\n<pre><code>\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.2.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL 2.9.x and 3.0.x.\n  The new minimum LibreSSL version is 3.1+.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed ``signer`` and ``verifier`` methods\n  from the public key and private key classes. These methods were originally\n  deprecated in version 2.0, but had an extended deprecation timeline due\n  to usage. Any remaining users should transition to ``sign`` and ``verify``.\n* Deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.0 support. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is no longer supported by\n  the OpenSSL project. The next release of ``cryptography`` will be the last\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.7</h2>\n<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596\">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527\">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make caching more verbose <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650\">#650</a></li>\n<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701\">#701</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w\">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>\n<li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>\n<li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.

[actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) from 2 to 3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python/releases\">actions/setup-python's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/382\">actions/setup-python#382</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default runtime to node16 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/340\">actions/setup-python#340</a>)</li>\n<li>Update <code>package-lock.json</code> file version to 2, <code>@types/node</code> to 16.11.25 and <code>typescript</code> to 4.2.3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/341\">actions/setup-python#341</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove legacy <code>pypy2</code> and <code>pypy3</code> keywords (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/342\">actions/setup-python#342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>With the update to Node 16, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</p>\n<p>This new major release removes support of legacy <code>pypy2</code> and <code>pypy3</code> keywords. Please use more specific and flexible syntax to specify a PyPy version:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        python-version:\n        - 'pypy-2.7' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 2.7\n        - 'pypy-3.8' # the latest available version of PyPy that supports Python 3.8\n        - 'pypy-3.8-v7.3.8' # Python 3.8 and PyPy 7.3.8\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    - uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See more usage examples in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python#specifying-a-pypy-version\">documentation</a></p>\n<h2>Update primary and restore keys for pip</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/303\">include a version of python in restore and primary cache keys for pip</a>. Besides, we add temporary fix for Windows caching <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/332\">issue</a>, that the <code>pip cache dir</code> command returns non zero exit code or writes to stderr. Moreover we updated <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/327\">node-fetch dependency</a>.</p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 1.0.8</h2>\n<p>We have updated <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md#108\">actions/cache</a> dependency version to 1.0.8 to support 10GB cache upload</p>\n<h2>Support caching dependencies</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-python/pull/266\">actions/setup-python#266</a>)</p>\n<h2>Caching dependencies.</h2>\n<p>The action has a built-in functionality for caching and restoring pip/pipenv dependencies. The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default.</p>\n<p>Besides, this release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure.</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (requirements.txt for pip or Pipfile.lock for pipenv) in the whole repository.

tests: add way to skip tests that require access to the network/Internet\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces two new variables which allow to skip some of the tests run:\r\n\r\n * `NO_INTERNET` -> skips the tests that require access to the Internet\r\n * `NO_NETWORK` -> skips the tests that require the network to be up.\r\n\r\n`NO_NETWORK` implies `NO_INTERNET`.\r\n\r\nTests that are skipped by `NO_NETWORK` include tests that bind sockets to the loopback interface.\r\n\r\nAs for the two tests that are skipped with `NO_INTERNET`, they respectively:\r\n\r\n * send DNS queries and expect a NXDOMAIN response\r\n * attempt to send packets to 10.255.255.1 and expect a timeout (this requires a default route)\r\n\r\n#### Rationale\r\n\r\nIn Ubuntu, we don't have full access to the Internet when running the test suite as part of autopkgtest, so we will set the `NO_INTERNET` variable to skip the tests that we cannot run.\r\nTo simulate a lack of Internet access, I ran the tests in a new, clean, network namespace (i.e., `# ip netns add test ; ip netns exec test /bin/bash`). Unfortunately, more tests started to fail (including the ones that bind to the loopback interface).\r\nTherefore, I also added the `NO_NETWORK` variable, that disables more tests.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOlivier\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code
