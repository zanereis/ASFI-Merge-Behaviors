What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA previous refactor mistakenly used `isValid` for add. Since `defaultValidValue` was always `0`, this didn't cause any correctness issues.\r\n\r\nWhat we really want to do for add (and merge) is `if (isZero) _value = 0`.\r\n\r\nAlso removing `isValid` since its redundant, if `defaultValidValue` is always `0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are no correctness errors, but this is confusing and error-prone.\r\n\r\nA negative `defaultValidValue` was intended to allow creating optional metrics. With the previous behavior this would incorrectly add the sentinel value. `defaultValidValue` is supposed to determine what value is exposed to the user.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning the tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, WindowExec Physical Operator does not have any SQLMetrics except spillSize (in-memory). This PR aims to add WindowExec SQLMetrics to provide following information from WindowExec usage during query execution:\r\n```\r\nnumOfOutputRows: Number of total output rows.\r\nnumOfPartitions: Number of processed input partitions.\r\nnumOfWindowPartitions: Number of generated window partitions.\r\nspilledRows: Number of total spilled rows.\r\nspillSizeOnDisk: Total spilled data size on disk.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an example use-case, WindowExec spilling behavior depends on multiple factors and it can sometime cause `SparkOutOfMemoryError` instead of spilling to disk so it is hard to track without SQL Metrics such as:\r\n**1-** WindowExec creates ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray (internal ArrayBuffer) per task (a.k.a child RDD partition)\r\n**2-** When ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray size exceeds spark.sql.windowExec.buffer.in.memory.threshold=4096, ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray switches to UnsafeExternalSorter as spillableArray by moving its all buffered rows into UnsafeExternalSorter and ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray (internal ArrayBuffer) is cleared. In this case, WindowExec starts to write UnsafeExternalSorter' s buffer (a.k.a UnsafeInMemorySorter).\r\n**3-** UnsafeExternalSorter is being created per window partition. When UnsafeExternalSorter' buffer size exceeds spark.sql.windowExec.buffer.spill.threshold=Integer.MAX_VALUE, it starts to write to disk and get cleared all buffer (a.k.a UnsafeInMemorySorter) content. In this case, UnsafeExternalSorter will continue to buffer next records until exceeding spark.sql.windowExec.buffer.spill.threshold.\r\n\r\n**New WindowExec SQLMetrics Sample Screenshot:**\r\n<img

help Spark users for better understanding about Window functions runtime results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew 4 Unit Test have been added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-09T23:19:46Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T00:20:12Z","closed_at":"2024-06-07T00:20:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83c02cea4487ff0f9f69eab473b8e2a7c98135c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bad1d76ad1c9541decba21bd60fd66f077d0950b","head":{"label":"erenavsarogullari:SPARK-46639","ref":"SPARK-46639","sha":"bad1d76ad1c9541decba21bd60fd66f077d0950b","user":{"login":"erenavsarogullari","id":1437738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari","html_url":"https://github.com/erenavsarogullari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":437154718,"node_id":"R_kgDOGg5zng","name":"spark","full_name":"erenavsarogullari/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"erenavsarogullari","id":1437738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari","html_url":"https://github.com/erenavsarogullari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/erenavsarogullari/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- In `RemoveRedundantAliases`, we have an `excluded` AttributeSet argument denoting the references for which we should not remove aliases. For a query with subquery expressions, adding the attributes references by the subquery in the `excluded` set prevents rewrites that might remove presumedly redundant aliases. (Changes in RemoveRedundantAlias)\r\n- Added a configuration flag to disable this fix, if not needed.\r\n- Added a unit test with Filter exists subquery expression to show how the alias would have been removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- `RemoveRedundantAliases` does not take into account the outer attributes of a `SubqueryExpression` when considering redundant aliases, potentially removing them if it thinks they are redundant.\r\n- This can cause scenarios where a subquery expression has conditions like `a#x = a#x` i.e. both the attribute names and the expression ID(s) are the same. This can then lead to conflicting expression ID(s) error.\r\n- For example, in the query example below, the `RemoveRedundantAliases` would remove the alias `a#0 as a#1` and replace `a#1` with `a#0` in the Filter exists subquery expression which would create an issue if the subquery expression had an attribute with reference `a#0` (possible due to different scan relation instances possibly having the same attribute ID(s) (Ref: #40662)\r\n```\r\nFilter exists [a#1 && (a#1 = b#2)]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation <empty>, [b#2]\r\n  +- Project [a#0 AS a#1]\r\n  +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nFilter exists [a#0 && (a#0 = b#2)]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation <empty>, [b#2]\r\n  +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0]\r\n```\r\n- The changes are needed to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a unit test with Filter exists subquery expression to show how the alias would have been removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

The default behavior is still dropping an empty message field. The new option will enable customer to keep the empty message field though they will observe a dummy column. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-09T22:10:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T02:02:41Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T02:02:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b039d80fffab6603d43a0c931c035ab133917c26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c222230413e3eb6ddcf7b7070aa3b711a26dbdde","head":{"label":"chaoqin-li1123:empty_proto","ref":"empty_proto","sha":"c222230413e3eb6ddcf7b7070aa3b711a26dbdde","user":{"login":"chaoqin-li1123","id":55518381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55518381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":538626126,"node_id":"R_kgDOIBrITg","name":"spark","full_name":"chaoqin-li1123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaoqin-li1123","id":55518381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55518381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123","html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaoqin-li1123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaoqin-li1123/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a minor bug in literal validation. The contract of `InternalRow` is people should call `isNullAt` instead of relying on the `get` function to return null. `InternalRow` is an abstract class and it's not guaranteed that the `get` function can work for null field. This PR fixes the literal validation to check `isNullAt` before getting the field value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix bugs for specific `InternalRow` implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to replace `AtomicBoolean` with `volatile` boolean for some code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`volatile` could keep the visibility and is a lightweight synchronization method.\r\nWe should consider using volatile variables if the following requirements are met.\r\n\r\n- The write operation on variables does not depend on the current value of the variable, or only a single thread updates the value of the variable.\r\n\r\n- This variable will not be included in the invariant condition along with other state variables.\r\n\r\n- No locking is required when accessing variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-09T07:44:18Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T02:12:00Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T02:12:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"531d4375052f3602121f9a5f3cdb2b6e59058ab3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb924b9b3b5d3d06ee1b45721e151fe68e6502ff","head":{"label":"beliefer:replace-atomicboolean-with-volatile","ref":"replace-atomicboolean-with-volatile","sha":"eb924b9b3b5d3d06ee1b45721e151fe68e6502ff","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds [Input Streaming Source's](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#input-sources) option `maxBytesPerTrigger` for limiting the total size of input files in a streaming batch. Semantics of `maxBytesPerTrigger` is very close to already existing one `maxFilesPerTrigger` option. \r\n\r\n#### How a feature was implemented?\r\nBecause `maxBytesPerTrigger` is semantically close to `maxFilesPerTrigger` I used all the `maxFilesPerTrigger` usages in the whole repository as a potential places that requires changes, that includes:\r\n- Option paramater definition\r\n- Option related logic\r\n- Option related ScalaDoc and MD files\r\n- Option related test\r\n\r\nI went over the usage of all usages of `maxFilesPerTrigger` in `FileStreamSourceSuite` and implemented `maxBytesPerTrigger` in the same fashion as those two are pretty close in their nature. From the structure and elements of ReadLimit I've concluded that current design implies only one simple rule for ReadLimit, so I openly prohibited the setting of both maxFilesPerTrigger and maxBytesPerTrigger at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis feature is useful for our and our sister teams and we expect it will find a broad acceptance among Spark users. We have a use-case in a few of the Spark pipelines we support when we use Available-now trigger for periodic processing using Spark Streaming. We use `maxFilesPerTrigger` threshold for now, but this is not ideal as Input file size might change with the time which requires periodic configuration adjustment of `maxFilesPerTrigger`. Computational complexity of the job depends on the event count/total size of the  input and `maxBytesPerTrigger` is a better predictor of that than `maxFilesPerTrigger`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests were added or existing `maxFilesPerTrigger` test were extended. I searched `maxFilesPerTrigger` related test  and added new tests or extended existing ones trying to minimize and simplify the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in Avro connector with regard to zero-length blocks. If a file contains one of these blocks, the Avro connector may return an incorrect number of records or even an empty DataFrame in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis was due to the way the `hasNextRow` check worked. `hasNext` method in Avro loads the next block so if the block is empty, it would return false and Avro connector will stop reading rows. However, we should continue checking the next block instead until the sync point.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a correctness bug in Avro connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test and a generated sample file to verify the fix. Without the patch, reading such file would return fewer records or 0 compared to the actual number (depends on the maxPartitionBytes config).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd [custom Jekyll tags][custom] to enable us to conditionally include files in our documentation build in a more user-friendly manner. [This example][example] demonstrates how a custom tag can build on one of Jekyll's built-in tags.\r\n\r\n[custom]: https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Programmers#create-your-own-tags\r\n[example]: https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/370#issuecomment-688782101\r\n\r\nWithout this change, files have to be included as follows:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% for static_file in site.static_files %}\r\n    {% if static_file.name == 'generated-agg-funcs-table.html' %}\r\n        {% include_relative generated-agg-funcs-table.html %}\r\n        {% break %}\r\n    {% endif %}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, they can be included more intuitively in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% include_relative_if_exists generated-agg-funcs-table.html %}\r\n{% include_api_gen generated-agg-funcs-table.html %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`include_relative_if_exists` includes a file if it exists and substitutes an HTML comment if not. Use this tag when it's always OK for an include not to exist.\r\n\r\n`include_api_gen` includes a file if it exists. If it doesn't, it tolerates the missing file only if one of the `SKIP_` flags is set. Otherwise it raises an error. Use this tag for includes that are generated for the language APIs. These files are required to generate complete documentation, but we tolerate their absence during development---i.e. when a skip flag is set.\r\n\r\n`include_api_gen` will place a visible text placeholder in the document and post a warning to the console to indicate that missing API files are being tolerated.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ SKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll build\r\nConfiguration file: /Users/nchammas/dev/nchammas/spark/docs/_config.yml\r\n            Source: /Users/nchammas/dev/nchammas/spark/docs\r\n       Destination: /Users/nchammas/dev/nchammas/spark/docs/_site\r\n Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental\r\n      Generating... \r\nWarning: Tolerating missing API files because the following skip flags are set: SKIP_API\r\n                    done in 1.703 seconds.\r\n Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes #44393.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nJekyll does not have a succinct way to [check if a file exists][check], so the required directives to implement such functionality are very cumbersome.\r\n\r\nWe need the ability to do this so that we can [build the docs successfully with `SKIP_API=1`][build], since many includes reference files that are only generated when `SKIP_API` is _not_ set.\r\n\r\n[check]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7528\r\n[build]: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44627\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually building and reviewing the docs, both with and without `SKIP_API=1`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Bump jekyll to 4.3.3.\r\n2. Loosen the dependency spec for jekyll to make updates easier.\r\n3. Don't mention Ruby 1 or 2 in the docs.\r\n4. Don't use `sudo` with `gem` in the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Jekyll 4.3.2 is [broken on Ruby 3.3.0][1]. Jekyll 4.3.3 [fixes the issue][2].\r\n2. There is no need to pin Jekyll in the Gemfile since it gets pinned automatically for us in the lock file. This makes updating dependencies via `bundle update` easier.\r\n3. Both Ruby 1 and 2 are [EOL][eol]. We should not use or reference them in the docs.\r\n4. Installing stuff as the superuser is explicitly discouraged by both pip and gem. Pip issues this warning:\r\n\r\n    > WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv\r\n\r\n    And bundler issues this warning:\r\n\r\n    > Don't run Bundler as root. Installing your bundle as root will break this application for all non-root users on this machine.\r\n\r\n    We should not encourage this pattern in our docs.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/9510\r\n[2]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/releases/tag/v4.3.3\r\n[eol]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/12/ruby-2-7-6-released/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuilding the docs against Ruby 3.2.2 and 3.3.0.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**The bug:** If running `create table if not exists as select...` (or `SaveAsTable` using `SaveMode.Ignore`) and the table does not exist in the catalog, the data-files are always overwritten.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Running `create table if not exists as select...` should not overwrite the existing data-files (more similar to the `create table as select` behavior).\r\n\r\nFor reference, the `create table as select` (or `SaveAsTable` using `SaveMode.ErrorIfExists`) statement just throws an exception instead of overwriting the data-files.\r\n\r\nThis expectation is in line with the documentation (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/sql/SaveMode.html):\r\n\r\n> Ignore mode means that when saving a DataFrame to a data source, if data already exists, the save operation is expected to not save the contents of the DataFrame and to not change the existing data.\r\n\r\n**The cause:** `DataWritingCommand.assertEmptyRootPath` verifies if the storage-location exists only if the `SaveMode` is `ErrorIfExists` (to know whether to save or throw exceptions in `create table as select` statements). When the `SaveMode` is `Ignore` (as is the case in `create table if not exists as select...` statements), the presence of files in the storage-location is not checked, so later the statement will force-overwrite the contents.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's a bug: inconsistent behavior depending on which case it is in the test-matrix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------------------------+------------------------------------------+\r\n|                            | Behavior when overwriting data-files     |\r\n|    SQL statement

manner.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Went manually through the test-matrix again, checked that the table was not overwritten.\r\n* Added unit-tests to automatically check for regressions.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimplify code and fix new use of DateTimeFormat.withZone introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44613 ; need to use the new object copy this creates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribing on mailing list from Janda Martin:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDateTimeFormatter is thread-safe and immutable according to JavaDoc so method DateTimeFormatter::withZone returns new instance when zone is changed.\r\n\r\nFollowing code has no effect:\r\n  val oldTimezones = (batchTimeFormat.getZone, batchTimeFormatWithMilliseconds.getZone)\r\n  if (timezone != null) {\r\n      val zoneId = timezone.toZoneId\r\n      batchTimeFormat.withZone(zoneId)\r\n      batchTimeFormatWithMilliseconds.withZone(zoneId)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSuggested fix:\r\nintroduce local variables for \"batchTimeFormat\" and \"batchTimeFormatWithMilliseconds\" and remove \"oldTimezones\" and \"finally\" block.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUnlikely, the path in question is apparently test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-08T08:26:45Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T10:10:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-08T10:10:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8875a84b6778161d180226a95e7549e9369e2060","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the undesired behavior that concurrent `CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS` queries could throw `TABLE_OR_VIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS` exceptions.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis code proposes to introduce a new object named `SqlApiConfHelper` to contain shared code between `SqlApiConf` and `SqlConf`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs of now, SqlConf will access some of the variables of SqlApiConf while SqlApiConf also try to initialize SqlConf upon initialization.  This PR is to avoid potential circular dependency between SqlConf and SqlApiConf. The shared variables or access to the shared variables are moved to the new `SqlApiConfHelper`. So either SqlApiConf and SqlConf wants to initialize the other side, they will only initialize the same third object.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR creates a suite, `GeneratedSubquerySuite`, that generates SQL with variations of subqueries. These variations include:\r\n1. The location of the subquery in the main query (SELECT, FROM, WHERE)\r\n2. Whether the subquery is correlated, if it is in SELECT or WHERE.\r\n3. The type of subquery predicate, if it is in WHERE.\r\n4. Whether the subquery has a DISTINCT projection.\r\n5. The operators in the subquery: currently there are JOINS, SET OPS, LIMIT and AGGREGATE (sum, count, groupby, no-groupby).\r\n\r\nHow this works is that this suite generates SQL queries, and are then run against Postgres using docker integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  7. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are a lot of subquery correctness issues, ranging from very old bugs to new ones that are being introduced due to work being done on subquery correlation optimization. This is especially in the areas of COUNT bugs and null behaviors.\r\n\r\nTo increase test coverage and robustness in this area, we want to write a subquery generator that writes variations of subqueries, producing SQL tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds test. NA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe class descriptions of the test cases in the `docker-integration-tests` module provide suggested commands for executing the test cases, but these commands will search for corresponding test cases in all modules. This pr adds the module name `docker-integration-tests` to these commands, so that the test commands only search for corresponding test cases in the `docker-integration-tests` module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefine docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have manually checked the new command locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to support `s.c.immutable.ArraySeq` as `customCollectionCls` in `MapObjects`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause `s.c.immutable.ArraySeq` is a commonly used type in Scala 2.13, we should support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, We support `s.c.immutable.ArraySeq` in `MapObjects`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT: Added a new test for `ArraySeq` in UDFSuite; Also updated `ObjectExpressionsSuite` for `MapObjects`.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-04T08:03:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T01:48:36Z","closed_at":"2024-01-05T04:08:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a89b529b1cab1fa230deabf3788c48550673d703","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e399f281457bdc1e6cdc0f760f27dc54344a2dc","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-46586","ref":"SPARK-46586","sha":"7e399f281457bdc1e6cdc0f760f27dc54344a2dc","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following code exists in branch-3.5:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fb90ade2c7390077d2755fc43b73e63f5cf44f21/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L744-L749\r\n\r\nFrom the code comments, when using Scala 2.12, `metricsPoller.getTaskMetricPeaks(taskId)` is wrapped as `WrappedArray` to avoid collection copying, and the subsequent `metricPeaks.toSeq` is a redundant collection conversion for Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\nHowever, for Scala 2.13, if `metricsPoller.getTaskMetricPeaks(taskId)` is still wrapped as `WrappedArray/mutable.ArraySeq`, it is impossible to avoid collection conversion, because the subsequent `metricPeaks.toSeq` will trigger a collection copy when using Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nSo this pr changes the process to directly wrap `metricPeaks` as `immutable.ArraySeq` to ensure the same effect as when using Scala 2.12, which is also more in line with the original comment description.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid unnecessary collection copying when using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo changes:\r\n- Update comment on `AccumulatorV2`'s `isZero` to reflect what it actually does.\r\n- Update variable name in `SQLMetrics` to `defaultValidValue` to reflect this\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`AccumulatorV2`'s `isZero` doesn't do what the comment implies - it actually checks if the accumulator hasn't been updated.\r\n\r\nThe comment implies that for a `LongAccumulator`, for example, a value of `0` would cause `isZero` to be `true`. But if we were to `add(0)`, then the value would still be `0` but `isZero` would return `false`.\r\n\r\nChanging the name of `zeroValue` to `defaultValidValue` to avoid confusion since `isZero` doesn't use `zeroValue` in `SQLMetric`.\r\n\r\nThanks @arvindsaik for pointing this out.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-03T23:36:21Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T09:22:39Z","closed_at":"2024-01-08T09:22:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95871ad600eba8dd6bd7cc7f53fcf0ec51afba61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8b1bc04af7a35b2bd751d9a07f85da3105982c6","head":{"label":"davintjong-db:sqlmetric-zerovalue-refactor","ref":"sqlmetric-zerovalue-refactor","sha":"b8b1bc04af7a35b2bd751d9a07f85da3105982c6","user":{"login":"davintjong-db","id":107501978,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmhZmg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107501978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davintjong-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":728364441,"node_id":"R_kgDOK2n1mQ","name":"spark","full_name":"davintjong-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davintjong-db","id":107501978,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmhZmg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107501978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davintjong-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davintjong-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davintjong-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check existence of error class in Scala connect client while converting errors from proto to Spark exceptions. And when an error class doesn't exists, use some legacy error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid internal errors when the client receives non-existent error class from the connect server, for instance in the case `client 4.0` <-> `server 4.1` as new Spark versions might have new error classes that have been ported to old clients.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the connect client (Scala client) won't fail w/ an internal error when it cannot find an error class.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing GAs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-03T19:19:04Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T02:35:58Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T02:35:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13aeb09e71d8ed5c43507df817109b1b90f5e348","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e52e5513ed5c0b99278cf666ab01748b13e9615","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:connect-no-error-class","ref":"connect-no-error-class","sha":"6e52e5513ed5c0b99278cf666ab01748b13e9615","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe upcoming tests with the new hive configurations will have no effect due to the leaked SessionState.\r\n\r\n```\r\n06:21:12.848 pool-1-thread-1 INFO ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite: Trying to start HiveThriftServer2: mode=http, attempt=0\r\n....\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:OperationManager is inited.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:SessionManager is inited.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service: CLIService is inited.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:ThriftBinaryCLIService is inited.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service: HiveServer2 is inited.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:OperationManager is started.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:SessionManager is started.\r\n06:21:12.851 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service: CLIService is started.\r\n06:21:12.852 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:ThriftBinaryCLIService is started.\r\n06:21:12.852 pool-1-thread-1 INFO ThriftCLIService: Starting ThriftBinaryCLIService on port 10000 with 5...500 worker threads\r\n06:21:12.852 pool-1-thread-1 INFO AbstractService: Service:HiveServer2 is started.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the logs above revealed, ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite started the ThriftBinaryCLIService instead of the ThriftHttpCLIService. This is because in HiveClientImpl, the new configurations are only applied to hive conf during initializing but not for existing ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cause ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite retrying or even aborting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix flakiness in tests\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an new param to HiveThriftServer2.startWithContext` to tell the `ThriftCLIService`s whether to call `System exit` or not when encountering errors. When developers call `HiveThriftServer2.startWithContext` and if an error occurs, `System exit` will be performed, stop the existing `SqlContext/SparkContext`, and crash the user app.\r\n\r\nThere is also such a use case in our tests. We intended to retry starting a thrift server three times in total but it might stop the underlying SparkContext early and fail the rest.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7271496487/job/19812142981\r\n\r\n```java\r\n06:21:12.854 ERROR org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite: Error start hive server with Context \r\norg.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: SharedThriftServer.this.tempScratchDir.exists() was true\r\n\tat org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:472)\r\n\tat org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException$(Assertions.scala:471)\r\n\tat org.scalatest.Assertions$.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:1231)\r\n\tat org.scalatest.Assertions$AssertionsHelper.macroAssert(Assertions.scala:1295)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SharedThriftServer.startThriftServer(SharedThriftServer.scala:151)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SharedThriftServer.$anonfun$beforeAll$1(SharedThriftServer.scala:59)\r\n\tat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.scala:18)\r\n06:21:12.854 ERROR org.apache.hive.service.cli.thrift.ThriftCLIService: Error starting HiveServer2: could not start ThriftBinaryCLIService\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.apache.thrift.server.TServer.serve()\" because \"this.server\" is null\r\n\tat org.apache.hive.service.cli.thrift.ThriftBinaryCLIService.run(ThriftBinaryCLIService.java:135)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n06:21:12.941 ERROR org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite: Error start hive server with Context \r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: LiveListenerBus is stopped.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.LiveListenerBus.addToQueue(LiveListenerBus.scala:92)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.LiveListenerBus.addToStatusQueue(LiveListenerBus.scala:75)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2$.createListenerAndUI(HiveThriftServer2.scala:74)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2$.startWithContext(HiveThriftServer2.scala:66)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SharedThriftServer.startThriftServer(SharedThriftServer.scala:141)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SharedThriftServer.$anonfun$beforeAll$4(SharedThriftServer.scala:60)\r\n\tat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.scala:18)\r\n06:21:12.958 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[info] org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite *** ABORTED *** (151 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot call methods on a stopped SparkContext.\r\n[info] This stopped SparkContext was created at:\r\n[info] \r\n[info] org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.ThriftServerWithSparkContextInHttpSuite.beforeAll(ThriftServerWithSparkContextSuite.scala:279)\r\n[info] org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll.liftedTree1$1(BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:212)\r\n[info] org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll.run(BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:210)\r\n[info] org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll.run$(BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:208)\r\n[info] org.apache.spark.SparkFunSuite.run(SparkFunSuite.scala:69)\r\n[info] org.scalatest.tools.Framework.org$scalatest$tools$Framework$$runSuite(Framework.scala:321)\r\n[info] org.scalatest.tools.Framework$ScalaTestTask.execute(Framework.scala:517)\r\n[info] sbt.ForkMain$Run.lambda$runTest$1(ForkMain.java:414)\r\n[info] java.base/java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:264)\r\n[info] java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1136)\r\n[info] java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:635)\r\n[info] java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n[info] \r\n[info] The currently active SparkContext was created at:\r\n[info] \r\n[info] (No active SparkContext.)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.assertNotStopped(SparkContext.scala:122)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.<init>(SparkSession.scala:115)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.newSession(SparkSession.scala:274)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SharedThriftServer.startThriftServer(SharedThriftServer.scala:130)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `attachCleanupResourceChecker` in `JoinSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`attachCleanupResourceChecker` is invalid: \r\n1. The matching of `SortExec` needs to be in `QueryExecution.executePlan` not `QueryExecution.sparkPlan`, The correct way is `foreachUp(df.queryExecution.executedPlan){f()}`.\r\n2. `Mockito` counts the number of function calls, only for objects after `spy`. Calls to the original object are not counted. eg\r\n```\r\ntest() {\r\n    val data = new java.util.ArrayList[String]()\r\n    val _data = spy(data)\r\n    data.add(\"a\");\r\n    data.add(\"b\");\r\n    data.add(\"b\");\r\n    _data.add(\"b\")\r\n    verify(_data, times(0)).add(\"a\")\r\n    verify(_data, times(1)).add(\"b\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nTherefore, when using `df.queryExecution.executedPlan` correctly to match, count is always 0.\r\n3. Not all `SortMergeJoin` joinTypes will trigger `cleanupResources()`, such as 'full outer join'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocal test, update `attachCleanupResourceChecker` atLeastOnce to nerver, ut is still successful. \r\n```\r\nverify(sortExec, atLeastOnce).cleanupResources()\r\nverify(sortExec.rowSorter, atLeastOnce).cleanupResources()\r\n```\r\nto \r\n```\r\nverify(sortExec, never).cleanupResources()\r\nverify(sortExec.rowSorter, never).cleanupResources()\r\n```\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T11:15:34Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T02:37:13Z","closed_at":"2024-01-04T02:32:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"beacf9a1e75d481e264ff6d950510c4442464a20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c833a4b5f618a4f5bb03f562f8ab60a8cd8aad03","head":{"label":"zml1206:SPARK-21492","ref":"SPARK-21492","sha":"c833a4b5f618a4f5bb03f562f8ab60a8cd8aad03","user":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":500757268,"node_id":"R_kgDOHdjzFA","name":"spark","full_name":"zml1206/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis follow-up refactors the handling of value tags and endElement.\r\n\r\n1. As value tags only exist in structure data, their handling will be confined to the inferObject method, eliminating the need for processing in inferField. This implies that when we encounter non-whitespace characters, we can invoke inferObject. For structures with a single primitive field, we'll simplify them into primitive types during the schema inference.\r\n2. We wanted to make sure that the entire entry, including the starting tag, value, and ending tag are all consumed when we completed the parsing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis follow-up simplifies the handling of value tags.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-03T08:01:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-07T23:53:56Z","closed_at":"2024-01-07T23:53:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf28739fa37377af3be81efda2fe8577b0de02d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99f52044df8f87fa3651baed26ec482b9090a447","head":{"label":"shujingyang-db:cpature-values-follow-up","ref":"cpature-values-follow-up","sha":"99f52044df8f87fa3651baed26ec482b9090a447","user":{"login":"shujingyang-db","id":135740748,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBc9TA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135740748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":695990001,"node_id":"R_kgDOKXv28Q","name":"spark","full_name":"shujingyang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shujingyang-db","id":135740748,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBc9TA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135740748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run `Python 3.11` and `3.12` tests independently.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CI is broken. It's easier to split the versions to isolate and identify the Python version-related root cause.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-02 at 12 44

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis should be tested after merging because `Python CI` is a daily test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the `options` field to use a case-insensitive dictionary to keep the behavior consistent with the Scala side (which uses `CaseInsensitiveStringMap`). Currently, `options` are stored in a normal Python dictionary which can be confusing to users. For instance:\r\n```python\r\nclass MyDataSource(DataSource):\r\n    def __init__(self, options):\r\n        self.api_key = options.get(\"API_KEY\") # <- This is None\r\n\r\nspark.read.format(..).option(\"API_KEY\", my_key).load(...)\r\n```\r\nHere, `options` will not have this \"API_KEY\" as everything is converted to lowercase on the Scala side. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve usability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to remove `ThreadLocal` for `ReadAheadInputStream`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ReadAheadInputStream` has a field `oneByte` declared as `TheadLocal`.\r\nIn fact, `oneByte` only used in read.\r\nWe can remove it by the way that the closure of local variables in instance methods can provide thread safety guarantees.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `TheadLocal` occupies a certain amount of space in the heap and there are allocation and GC costs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr removed the retrieval of `keytabFile` from `UserGroupInformation` in `HiveAuthFactory` because `keytabFile` no longer exists in `UserGroupInformation` after Hadoop 3.0.3. Therefore, in `HiveAuthFactory`, `keytabFile` will always be null and in `HiveAuthFactory`, `keytabFile` will only be used when it is not null.\r\n\r\nFor the specific changes in Hadoop, please refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9747 | https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/59cf7588779145ad5850ad63426743dfe03d8347.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the invalid code.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr just change to use `exists` instead of `filter + nonEmpty` to check `showResourceColumn` in `MasterPage.scala`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nstate.workers.filter(_.resourcesInfoUsed.nonEmpty).nonEmpty\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nstate.workers.exists(_.resourcesInfoUsed.nonEmpty)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify the code: compared to `filter + nonEmpty`, using `exists` has the opportunity to terminate the iteration over the collection early.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
