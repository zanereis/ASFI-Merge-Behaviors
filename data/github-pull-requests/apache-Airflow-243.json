link: [AIRFLOW-6843](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6843)\r\n\r\nIf you're using the Kubernetes executor, Amazon EKS deletes pods very quickly after tasks complete. This can be an issue if you're scraping Airflow logs from a service like FluentD, as it means that the task pod gets deleted before FluentD can pick up logs for fast-running (or fast-failing) tasks.\r\n\r\nThe `kube_client_request_args` environment variable is passed to the `delete_namespaced_pod` client request, but we need a way to pass the `grace_period_seconds` param (and potentially others) to the `V1DeleteOptions` included in the body of the request. Towards that objective, I've created a `delete_option_kwargs` object that can be set via an Airflow environment variable. This is object is then passed to the `V1DeleteOptions` of the `delete_namespaced_pods` request.\r\n\r\nThis can be set via an `AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES__DELETE_OPTION_KWARGS` env var. The value should be JSON and can contain any of the options available in the [Kube client `V1DeleteOptions` class.](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/41f11a09995efcd0142e25946adc7591431bfb2f/kubernetes/client/models/v1_delete_options.py#L19)\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

start_new_processes and prepare_file_path_queue**\r\nThese functions are independent of each other, but as separate methods, they are easier to understand. A good methods name is the best documentation.\r\nI also changed to `_heartbeat_count` to `_no_run` because it better describes the role. This variable can increase without affecting heartbeat when DagFileProcessorManager is running in asynchronous mode.q\r\n**Move emit_metrics call**\r\nIt is not related to generating file_path_queue, so it should be called by the caller.\r\n**Inline heartbeat method**\r\nThis function does not make sense, because every time a full loop is performed.  It only hides the logic and makes it difficult to understand the code.\r\n**Move _kill_timed_out_processors to loop**\r\nIt is not related to generating the collect_results method, so it should be called by the caller.\r\n\r\nNow I have the impression that the sequence of operations is much more easy to understand because it is only found in the start method.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I do not want to change the sequence of operations.

airflow import DAG` is _such_ a common pattern that it's worth\r\nmaking sure this stays working.\r\n\r\nSince we are now on Python 3 we can use PEP-562 to have officially\r\nsupported lazy-loading of attributes on a module.\r\n\r\nSince the example_dags will be referred to/copied by users I have\r\nupdated them all back to import from the airflow module, but have left\r\nany internal uses untouched.\r\n\r\nThis approach taken from Celery: https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/f2ddd894c32f642a20f03b805b97e460f4fb3b4f/celery/__init__.py#L63-L78\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link:

SageMakerHook currently does not support any list_* operations (there are a few... https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sagemaker.html). This PR adds a generic method for iterating over list_* operation results and one implementation for list_training_jobs.\r\n\r\nBy default, boto3 caps the number of results to 10. This is configurable up to 100. I've implemented `_list_request` as a convenience function for making multiple requests to AWS in case more results are available. `SageMakerHook.list_training_jobs()` makes use of this convenience function.\r\n\r\nNot sure if tests should be added because all existing SageMakerHook tests simply test the number of calls to the underlying client's methods, which doesn't really validate correct behaviour IMO?\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.sagemaker import SageMakerHook\r\n\r\nhook = SageMakerHook()\r\nhook.list_training_jobs(max_results=150)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSay there are 2000 training jobs, then `_list_request()` will select 150 training jobs in 2 batches (first 100, next 50). \r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6882](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6882)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

link: [AIRFLOW-6874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6874)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\nMany airflow tasks create subprocesses and these subprocesses may create more subprocesses. In our experience, there is a risk that although a task failed and tried to reap the process group, there are still left over processes running and cause issues with both resources and correctness.\r\n\r\nPropose to improve the cgroup task runner to reap all processes for current node on node termination. \r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

change reduces page size by more than 10X and reduces page load time by 3-5X. As a result, the tree view can now load large DAGs that were causing 5XX errors before.\r\n\r\nAnother example: one of our DAGs' tree view had a page size of 200MB and took 1 minute to load. With this patch, it now loads within 24s with a page size of 17MB.\r\n\r\nList of optimizations applied to the view handler:\r\n* only seralize used task instance attributes to json instead of the\r\n  whole ORM object\r\n* encode task instance attributes as array instead of dict\r\n* encode datetime in unix timestamp instead of iso formmat string\r\n* push task instance attribute construction into client side JS\r\n* remove redundant task instance attributes\r\n* simplify reduce_nodes() logic, remove unnecessary if statements\r\n* seralize JSON as string to be used with JSON.parse on the client side\r\n  to speed up browser JS parse time\r\n* remove spaces in seralized JSON string to reduce payload size\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6871)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

BEST REVIEWED COMMIT-BY-COMMIT\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently many different sensors and operators are tested in the Hive operators module. Some of these operators already have test modules and others do not. This was [originally called out by @mik-lag](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7316#issuecomment-580946162) in #7316.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- Move non-operator tests into separate test modules, creating new ones as needed.\r\n- Create a shared `TestHiveEnvironment` class from `unittest.TestCase` that each of the test modules can use\r\n- Preserve existing test functionality and skipping when adding tests to existing modules\r\n- Update test names when being added to a more general module like `test_sql_sensor.py`\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6721](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6721)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

is to pick up the work started in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7098. I discussed with @TV4Fun and opened this new PR to continue the work.\r\n\r\n- Make behavior of `none_failed` consistent with documentation. Do not skip itself when all parents are skipped.\r\n- Add `none_failed_or_skipped` which behaves like the old `none_failed` trigger rule (i.e. all parents are success or skipped and at least one parent is success). One use case of `none_failed_or_skipped` is the join task in a workflow with nested `BranchPythonOperator`\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-4453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4453)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

our usecase need to support both ed25519 keys and 'MFA', using a signed key.\r\nThis pull request adds the possibility to both add support for these 2 things.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a hook some extra parameters become availble in the 'extra_parameters' hash, notably:\r\n\r\n    key_type: (str) can be rsa, ecdsa or ed25519; defaults to rsa\r\n    cert_file: (str) path towards the certicate. Defaults to None\r\n\r\nThe only thing I am not sure about yet is the part where we read the config file from ~/.ssh. \r\nThere we default to rsa. Is it ok? Or should we also try to figure out what keys are used? \r\n\r\nThis also rewrites the whole concept of the sshHOOK, and how it uses the keys.

link: [AIRFLOW-4526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4526)\r\n\r\nOur team has been affected by this issue. After reading through the issue history and reviewing the various proposals it seems like this was caused by an underlying problem with the kubernetes logs --follow behavior, as was detailed by @dorranh on the issue discussion. This change which was [already implemented in a fork](https://github.com/discordapp/incubator-airflow/pull/8) by @samschlegel works around the problem by polling logs instead of using k8s following.\r\n\r\nI am a first time contributor but would like to help with seeing through this issue being solved in an official Airflow release. I am not sure about the test writing aspect - there aren't any tests currently in the test_kubernetes_pod_operator for get_logs. Would be glad to follow through with writing tests, and/or changing any implementation details, based on your feedback or suggestions.
