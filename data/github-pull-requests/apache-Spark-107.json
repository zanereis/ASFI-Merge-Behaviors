The basic idea is to have fresh copies of stateful expressions before evaluating them. This is to avoid issues caused by the flexible DataFrame APIs:\r\n1. A single expression instance may appear more than once in the expression tree. We have to replace it with fresh copies to avoid sharing states.\r\n2. An expression tree can be evaluated by multiple callers at the same time. We have to use fresh copies before expression evaluation to avoid sharing states.\r\n\r\nHowever, the handling of stateful expression has several problems. This PR fixes all of them:\r\n1. We should use fresh copies with codegen as well. If the root expression extends `CodegenFallback`, then the expression tree will be evaluated using the interpreted mode, even with the codegen code path.\r\n2. The fresh copies will be dropped if the stateful expression is deeply nested (3 layers).\r\n3. `InterpretedSafeProjection` never implemented initialize() for initializing Nondeterministic expressions.\r\n4. `ConvertToLocalRelation` called a `InterpretedMutableProjection` constructor which did not implement the existing Stateful-copying logic. I fixed this by moving that logic out of a factory method and into class's main constructor, guaranteeing that it will always run.\r\n5. Stateful expression is not always nondeterministic, e.g. `ScalaUDF`. I removed the `Stateful` trait and added a `def stateful: Boolean` function in `Expression`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to apply tree-pattern based pruning for the rule ResolveWindowTime, to minimize the evaluation of rule with WindowTime node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe rule ResolveWindowTime is unnecessarily evaluated multiple times without proper pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. New test case is added to cover SQL usage for `window_time`.","created_at":"2022-12-27T11:36:11Z","updated_at":"2022-12-28T07:01:33Z","closed_at":"2022-12-28T07:01:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e86e8a1c7def83cce421a2fe82f8303eca719ecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91d4d9f474642149d94591debcb000d63e884fc5","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-41733","ref":"SPARK-41733","sha":"91d4d9f474642149d94591debcb000d63e884fc5","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39193 that:\r\n1. Disables `test_toDF_with_schema_string` back because it aims to test `RDD.toDF` which does not exist in Spark Connect.\r\n2. Disables `test_freqItems` back because `DataFrame.freqItems` does not exist in Spark Connect yet.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to set the `tz` parameter to the `UTC` time zone explicitly while constructing of python's datetime object from internal value of Catalyst's `TIMESTAMP` type. Internally, the `TIMESTAMP` type stores timestamps as microseconds since the epoch in the UTC time zone, so, the `datetime`'s input should reflect the info otherwise it assumes the local time zone which is incorrect. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the failure on aggregations of the minimal supported timestamp (0001-01-01 00:00:00Z). The code below portraits the issue:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timezone\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import TimestampType\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n>>> ts = spark.createDataFrame([datetime(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)], TimestampType()).toDF(\"test_column\")\r\n>>> ts.select(F.min('test_column')).first()[0]\r\n...\r\n  File \"/Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/python/pyspark/sql/types.py\", line 279, in fromInternal\r\n    return datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts // 1000000).replace(microsecond=ts % 1000000)\r\nValueError: year 0 is out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above returns a valid datetime object:\r\n```python\r\n>>> ts.select(F.min('test_column')).first()[0]\r\ndatetime.datetime(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ ./python/run-tests --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.test_types

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr brings two fixes：\r\n\r\n- Add sub-dir with `spark-ui` prefix under `spark.ui.store.path` for each Spark App to ensure that multiple Spark Apps can run normally use the same Spark Client with same `spark.ui.store.path` configuration\r\n\r\n- Automatically cleanup Live UI data when `SparkContext.stop()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are 2 issue before this pr:\r\n\r\n1.  Multiple Spark Apps can't run normally use the same Spark Client with same `spark.ui.store.path` configuration, the following exceptions will occur:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.rocksdb.RocksDBException: While lock file: /${baseDir}/listing.rdb/LOCK: Resource temporarily unavailable\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, only one Spark App can run normally use RocksDB as the Live UI store.\r\n\r\nAfter this pr, each Spark App uses an independent RocksDB directory when  `spark.ui.store.path` is specified as Live UI store.\r\n\r\n2.  `spark.ui.store.path` directory not clean up when `SparkContext.stop()`:\r\n   - The disk space occupied by the `spark.ui.store.path` directory will continue to grow.\r\n   - When submitting new App and reusing the `spark.ui.store.path` directory, we will see the content related to the previous App, which is a bit strange\r\n\r\nAfter this pr, `spark.ui.store.path` directory is is automatically cleaned by default when `SparkContext` stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR deduplicates `print` and `_repr_html_` logic by having a comment logic to handle them by looking up the signature and type hints (similar with what we're doing at Spark SQL's query string, e.g., `TreeNode.stringArgs`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually no.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested almost all cases, and complex cases too manually. In addition, I added a unittest too.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-26T13:47:48Z","updated_at":"2022-12-27T07:54:41Z","closed_at":"2022-12-27T01:11:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8285c4187c51e5fdeab364495c820b1da0665d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc756936639a28aea4d43d71d3040f7e6409e0b9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41717","ref":"SPARK-41717","sha":"bc756936639a28aea4d43d71d3040f7e6409e0b9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn SSLOptions rest of the settings should be set only when ssl is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf spark.ssl.enabled is false, there is no use of setting rest of spark.ssl.* settings in SSLOptions as this requires unnecessary operations to be performed to set these properties. \r\nAdditional implication of trying to set the rest of settings is if any error occurs in setting these properties it will cause job failure which otherwise should have worked since ssl is disabled. For example, if the user doesn't have access to the keystore path which is set in hadoop.security.credential.provider.path of hive-site.xml, it can result in failure while launching spark shell since SSLOptions won't be initialized due to error in accessing the keystore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

Often these tables are joined/grouped by the same keys and have the same number of partitions (from `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to implement all catalog API in Spark Connect, except `cache`, `uncache`, and `isCached` because of potential design issues (e.g., eager vs lazy). Namely it proposes the Catalog API below:\r\n\r\n- `spark.catalog.currentDatabase`\r\n- `spark.catalog.setCurrentDatabase`\r\n- `spark.catalog.listDatabases`\r\n- `spark.catalog.listTables`\r\n- `spark.catalog.listFunctions`\r\n- `spark.catalog.listColumns`\r\n- `spark.catalog.getDatabase`\r\n- `spark.catalog.getTable`\r\n- `spark.catalog.getFunction`\r\n- `spark.catalog.databaseExists`\r\n- `spark.catalog.tableExists`\r\n- `spark.catalog.functionExists`\r\n- `spark.catalog.createExternalTable`\r\n- `spark.catalog.createTable`\r\n- `spark.catalog.dropTempView`\r\n- `spark.catalog.dropGlobalTempView`\r\n- `spark.catalog.recoverPartitions`\r\n- `spark.catalog.clearCache`\r\n- `spark.catalog.refreshTable`\r\n- `spark.catalog.refreshByPath`\r\n- `spark.catalog.currentCatalog`\r\n- `spark.catalog.setCurrentCatalog`\r\n- `spark.catalog.listCatalogs`\r\n\r\nThe main approach is to stick to what we have in DataFrame API. It follows the same way as what we're doing in DataFrame API (see `DataFrame.show()` as an example).\r\n\r\nIt puts all into a DataFrame (e.g., a bool for `tableExists`, a string for `currentDatabase`, a list of tables, etc), and send them to the client side through Arrow batches, which makes us to avoid having another set of Protobuf messages for its responses.\r\n\r\nI explicitly marked them as internal-only for now because we would likely need more design here, for example, considering HMS thrift definitions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also adds `spark.table` (alias of `spark.read.table`) API in order to reuse PySpark tests. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor feature parity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds the support of Spark Connect in `spark.catalog`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReused the unitests of the existing PySpark Catalog tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-26T05:34:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:53Z","closed_at":"2022-12-26T22:59:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f63c6e6f3e35b4a7123c413a9a330130721b2152","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/623d3a6a2dd6c81fa255d0c252acd8912fea2b19","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41270","ref":"SPARK-41270","sha":"623d3a6a2dd6c81fa255d0c252acd8912fea2b19","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves the error handling on the Spark Connect server and client side. First, this patch moves the error handling logic on the server into a common error handler partial function that differentiates between the internal Spark errors and other runtime errors.\r\n\r\nFor custom Spark exceptions, the actual internal error is wrapped into a Google RPC Status and sent as trailing metadata to the client.\r\n\r\nOn the client side, similarly, the error handling is moved into a common function. All GRPC errors are wrapped into custom exceptions to avoid presenting the user with confusing GRPC errors. If available the attached RPC status is extracted and added to the exception. \r\n\r\nLastly, this patch adds basic logging functionality that can be enabled using the environment variable `SPARK_CONNECT_LOG_LEVEL` and can be set to `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsability\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Update `onJobEnd` method of `AppStatusListener`, removing the logic of reducing `job.activeStages` for each pending stage.\r\n- Add UT to verify whether `numActiveStages` of jobs data is correct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor property `activeStages` of `LiveJob`, it is updated when:\r\n- A job is started: `activeStages = 0`\r\n- A stage is submitted: `activeStages += 1`\r\n- A stage is completed: `activeStages -= 1`\r\n- A job is ended: `activeStages -= 1` for each pending stages\r\n\r\nAccording to the implementation of `AppStatusListener` and `LiveStage`:\r\n- When a job is created, all of its stages in job info will be created with state set to pending without updating `activeStages`.\r\n- When a stage is submitted, its state will be immediately set to active with `activeStages` increased by `1`.\r\n\r\nSo for pending stages, they won't affect `activeStages`. Therefore, when job is ended, `activeStages` shouldn't be decreased by `1` for each pending stage.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n- Job 0 starts with stage 0, 1, 2\r\n- Stage 0 submitted\r\n- Stage 0 completed\r\n- Job 0 ends\r\n\r\nIn this case, when job 0 ends, its `numActiveStages` will be `-2`, which is obviously incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor jobs API, property `activeStages` will be different if a job has pending stages when it ends. In these cases, previously the number is incorrect. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a UT of the example mentioned above, to make sure `numActiveStages` should be `0` instead of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces so AgnosticEncoders. AgnosticEncoders describe how an external type maps to a Spark data type. They are agnostic in the sense that they do not prescribe which internal format is to be used.\r\n\r\nFor example the following class:\r\n```\r\ncase class Person(id: Long, name: String, hobbies: Seq[String])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTranslates into the following agnostic encoder:\r\n```\r\nProductEncoder(Person,List(\r\n  (id, PrimitiveLongEncoder),\r\n  (name, StringEncoder),\r\n  (hobbies, IterableEncoder(scala.collection.Seq,StringEncoder))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates `AgnosticEncoders` in `ScalaReflection`, and so it is used for all `Dataset` operations. In a follow-up we will address `RowEncoder` and `JavaReflection`. In the old situation we would traverse the type hierarchy for each options (`serializedForType`, `deserializerForType` & `schemaFor`). In the new situation we will create an AgnosticEncoder first and then generate a serializer, deserializer, and/or `schema`. This saves significantly in time, especially for `ExpressionEncoder` where we only need one pass through the type hierarchy instead 2 or 3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor the Spark Connect Scala Client we need encoders. We want to stay as close to the current Dataset APIs and encoders are part of this. Additionally we would like retain the rich type support.\r\n\r\nEncoders are currently tied to ExpressionEncoders, we cannot use for a couple of reasons:\r\n1. Mid-term we don't want to have a dependency on Catalyst. Splitting of the public API that will be shared between Catalyst and the client is tracked in SPARK-41400.\r\n2. ExpressionEncoders only support the internal row format. The client will use Arrow instead.\r\n3. We are nog particularly keen on sending the expressions needed by ExpressionEncoders over the wire. They are overpowered.\r\n\r\nSo we need an alternative to the current ExpressionEncoders. This class need to be serializable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-12-22T19:03:35Z","updated_at":"2022-12-27T03:37:20Z","closed_at":"2022-12-27T03:37:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4eeb4f9b43ef9b7a2be462d12966a212ab61ddb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/445cb7d4a777d5d9900ee568403d4f60ea4da570","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-41690","ref":"SPARK-41690","sha":"445cb7d4a777d5d9900ee568403d4f60ea4da570","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow on to SPARK-40034.\r\n\r\nDynamic partitioning though the PathOutputCommitProtocol needs to add the dirs to the superclass's partition list else the partition delete doesn't\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n* add an addPartition() method subclasses can use\r\n* add a getPartitions method to return an immutable\r\n  copy of the list for testing.\r\n* add tests to verify all of this.\r\n\r\nAlso fix newTaskTempFileAbsPath to return a path, irrespective of committer type.\r\n\r\nIn dynamic mode, because the parent dir of an absolute path is deleted, there's a safety check to reject any requests for a file in a parent dir. This\r\nis something which could be pulled up to HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol because it needs the same check, if the risk is considered realistic.\r\n\r\nThe patch now downgrades from failing on dynamic partitioning if the committer doesn't declare it supports it to printing a warning. Why this? well, it\r\n*does* work through the s3a committers, it's just O(data). If someone does want to do INSERT OVERWRITE then they can be allowed to, just warned about\r\nit. The outcome will be correct except in the case of: \"if the driver fails partway through dir rename, only some of the files will be there\"\r\n\r\nGoogle GCS has that same non-atomic rename issue. But: even on an FS with atomic dir rename, any job which fails partway through the overwrite process\r\nis going to leave the fs in an inconsistent state, such as\r\n* some parts with new data, some parts not yet overwritten\r\n* a directory deleted and the new data not instantiated\r\n\r\nSo it's not that much worse.\r\n\r\nThe patch tries to update the protocol spec in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol to cover both newFileAbsPath() semantics/commit and failure modes of\r\ndynamic partition commit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* dynamic partition jobs aren't actually incorrect through the s3 committers, just slow, so if someone really wants it they should be free to.\r\n* the code in SPARK-40034 was incomplete. The new tests show that it works now.\r\n* the `newFileAbsPath()` code is required of all committers, even though (thankfully) it is not used much. \r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to do a minimal commit for complete functionality, with no attempt to improve performance with parallel dir setup, rename, etc.\r\nThat'd really be damage limitation: if you want performance in cloud, use a manifest format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUpdates the cloud docs to say that dynamic partition overwrite does work\r\neverywhere, just may be really slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests; run through spark and hadoop 3.3.5 RC0\r\n\r\nOne test area which is not covered is \"does the absolute path mapping work store the correct paths and marshal them correctly?\"\r\n\r\nI've just realised that I can test this without adding an accessor for the map just by calling `commitTask()` and parsing the `TaskCommitMessage` which comes back. \r\nShall I add that?\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-22T18:45:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:37Z","closed_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d3d34f647e91c6b015142dfcd9cc98942982bb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4a3352fbff0e27ff1e8b54bdc3d844beb746002","head":{"label":"steveloughran:SPARK-41551-path-output-dynamic","ref":"SPARK-41551-path-output-dynamic","sha":"f4a3352fbff0e27ff1e8b54bdc3d844beb746002","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch adds a new test case with ANSI mode on for group by all.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll is a reserved keyword when ANSI mode is on. It's important to have an explicit test case validating it because in the future we might parse reserved keyword tokens differently, leading to the analysis rule not capturing the group by all.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch is only about adding a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `sql()` method in PySpark to support parameterized SQL queries, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38864, and add new parameter - `args` of the type `Dict[str, str]`. This parameter maps named parameters that can occur in the input SQL query to SQL literals like 1, INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH, DATE'2022-12-22' (see [the doc ](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-literals.html)of supported literals).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\r\n    >>> spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM range(10) WHERE id > :minId\", args = {\"minId\" : \"7\"})\r\n       id\r\n    0   8\r\n    1   9\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #39159\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo achieve feature parity with Scala/Java API, and provide PySpark users the same feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nChecked the examples locally, and running the tests:\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --modules=pyspark-sql --parallelism=1\r\n```","created_at":"2022-12-22T13:57:20Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T09:30:43Z","closed_at":"2022-12-23T09:30:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc7721dca0872fbd584b052425c39ab6631c90bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark already supported the runtime filter. The runtime filter is a very good feature to reduce shuffle size.\r\nThis feature is implemented through the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Finds joins with equality conditions that can be evaluated using equi-join. e.g. ==.\r\n\r\n2. Check some prerequisites for this join.\r\n\r\n     2.1. If there is already a DPP filter on the key, refuse to inject runtime filter.\r\n     2.2 If there is already a runtime filter (Bloom filter or IN subquery) on the key, refuse to inject runtime filter.\r\n     2.3 If the keys of two side of join are not simple cheap expressions, refuse to inject runtime filter.\r\n\r\n3. Check the benefit if inject runtime filter.\r\n\r\n     3.1 The join expression of filter application side can be pushed down through joins, aggregates and windows. This decide to reduce shuffle size.\r\n     3.2 The filter creation side has a selective predicate. The better selective, the better to reduce data size.\r\n           **Note**: This PR will change the the behavior here, from **has one** selective predicate to **exists one** selective predicate. Before, we find the selective predicate from Filter node and check the expressions on Project are cheap. Now, not only do this and will find the selective predicate from Join node's child node on the same way.\r\n     3.3 The current join is a shuffle join or a broadcast join that has a shuffle below it.\r\n     3.4 The max scan size of filter application side is greater than a configurable threshold.\r\n\r\nAccording to 3.3, Spark runtime filter supports two scenes.\r\n1. When the Join itself is a Shuffle Join;\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/211998351-b616d2ca-cba6-4fd8-9768-8ff1d11ad8d6.png)\r\n\r\n5. When the join itself is a broadcast join and there is a Shuffle Join under one end of the join.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/211998413-e28f053f-ee15-4e8b-9281-1115f46e5892.png)\r\n\r\nIn user scene, the join relation is very complicated, such as, multi level join. To facilitate understanding, the below SQL is taken as an example.\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM T1\r\n    JOIN T2\r\n    JOIN T3\r\n    ON T1.c1 = T2.c2\r\n        AND T3.c3 = T2.c2\r\nWHERE T2.a2 = 5\r\n```\r\nSuppose T1 and T3 is big table or subquery and T2 is the smallest one. The current optimization only injects runtime filter(subquery on T2) in T1 since the SQL match the first scene.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/212867612-238a70e9-39e9-43a2-beac-f6b994830e71.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, we could also inject the runtime filter(subquery on T2) in T3 too.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/212868009-f4278e2b-86c8-4b03-92b7-65cabde52370.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR will improve q24a, q24b, q37 and q82 in TPC-DS and q17 in TPC-H.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Improve the supported scene for runtime filter \r\n2. Reduct the data size for shuffle and improve the performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\nMicro benchmark for q24a, q24b, q37 and q82 in TPC-DS.\r\n\r\n**2TB TPC-DS**\r\n\r\nTPC-DS Query   | Before(Seconds)  | After(Seconds)  | Speedup(Percent)\r\n----  |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39041 that avoids to set `null` as string for remote configuration and option.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the default as the regular PySpark as is. Otherwise, it attempts to create remote SparkSession by default, which later fails because of `null` Spark Connect URL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the main code has not be released yet.\r\nIt fixes `./bin/pyspark` case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe DECODE function was implemented for Oracle compatibility. It works similar to CASE expression, but it is supposed to have one major difference: NULL == NULL\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/functions057.htm#SQLRF00631\r\n\r\nThe Spark implementation does not observe this, however:\r\n```\r\n> select decode(null, 6, 'Spark', NULL, 'SQL', 4, 'rocks');\r\n\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is supposed to be 'SQL'. This PR is to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe DECODE function was implemented for Oracle compatibility. It works similar to CASE expression, but it is supposed to have one major difference: NULL == NULL\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/functions057.htm#SQLRF00631\r\n\r\nThe Spark implementation does not observe this, however:\r\n```\r\n> select decode(null, 6, 'Spark', NULL, 'SQL', 4, 'rocks');\r\n\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is supposed to be 'SQL'. This PR is to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIdeally it's OK to always propagate metadata columns, as column pruning will kick in later and prune them aways if they are not used. However, it may cause problems in cases like CTE. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39081 fixed such a bug.\r\n\r\nThis PR only propagates metadata columns if they are used, to keep the analyzed plan simple and reliable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid potential bugs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew
