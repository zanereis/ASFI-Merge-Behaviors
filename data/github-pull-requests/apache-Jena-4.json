issue resolved #2557\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nNormalization is mostly involved with literals where the lexical form has multiple ways to write the same value. Numbers are the major case: \"1\", \"001\", \"+1\" are ways to write the xsd:integer value 1.\r\n\r\nThere is now a framework for normalization, with 3 implementations, ARQ choices, XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1. The XSD differ in a few places: the canonical form of xsd:decimals for integer values, XSD 1.1 adds `+INF`.\r\n\r\nThe ARQ choices are, as near as possible, the same as previous versions and align with the effect of adding terms to TDB2 and reading them back again. This was the case up to Jena 5.0.0 but wasn't tested. Now it is contract so data can be normalized in a way thatTDB2 will preserve the exact RDF terms for float and double precision.\r\n\r\nMany files are changed because of a rename of `NodeFactory.createLiteral(string, datatype) ` to `NodeFactory.createLiteralDT(String, datatype)` to align with other 5.0.0 renaming. A deprecated placeholder is left behind.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit

looking into whether the prefixes service PR #2538 could be refactored to reduce code duplication I noticed that if an Action is registered directly as servicing a URL, rather than being associated with a Dataset, then if the Action tries to use any of the transaction handling of HttpAction it can result in NPEs because some access to the transactional context was not checking for non-null transactional objects.  This commit addresses that problem and should allow #2538 to be refactored.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key

resolves #2543\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains the addition of the prefixes service to Jena. The prefixes service allows for prefix management on a given dataset provided in the config.ttl file. When making requests to the API the url can have 3 parameters: prefix, uri, and prefixToRemove, the combination of which defines the operation performed. The read operations are fetching the prefix by URI, fetching the URI by prefix, and fetching all. The read-write operations are removing and updating prefix-URI pairs.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena website](https://github.com/apache/jena-site/)\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number

<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.

issue resolved #2506\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nTo keep the server stable and running, implementations of Fuseki operations must follow the HttpAction lifecycle for transactions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes one problem (found in code review, not as a live bug), and puts in consistency checking.\r\n\r\nThe consistency checks did show some incorrect use of the  HttpAction lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThere are also changes to remove other, unrelated logging messages output during Fuseki tests.\r\n\r\nThe function to apply a patch is moved to the Fuseki servlet package.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included \r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue

#2518.\r\n\r\nThe lack of built-in support for generic types of composite values such as lists and maps has been a long-standing issue for RDF and SPARQL. Together with a few other colleagues at the Amazon Neptune team we have developed an approach to represent lists and maps as literals in RDF data, and to extend SPARQL with features related to such literals. These extensions of SPARQL include:\r\n* an aggregation function to produce these composite values (FOLD),\r\n* functions to operate on these composite values in expressions, and\r\n* a new operator (UNFOLD) to unfold such composite values into their individual components.\r\n\r\nWe have created a [complete formal specification of the approach](https://w3id.org/awslabs/neptune/SPARQL-CDTs/spec/latest.html) and a comprehensive test suite for implementers, which can be found in our Github repo: https://github.com/awslabs/SPARQL-CDTs\r\n\r\n... and I have implemented a complete integration of this approach into Jena, as can be found in this PR. We would like to contribute this implementation to Jena if you are interested, and I will be more than happy to assist you with getting the PR ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nPerhaps before you dive into the aforementioned specification, you may take a look at our [short paper](http://olafhartig.de/files/HartigEtAl_SPARQLCDTs_PosterPaper2024.pdf), in which we provide a slightly more extensive motivation for this work and a (very!) brief summary of the approach. After that, [Section 2  of the specification](https://awslabs.github.io/SPARQL-CDTs/spec/latest.html#description) provides a more detailed informal description of the different parts of the approach.\r\n\r\nI am happy to answer any questions that you may have, both about the approach in general and about the implementation in this PR. Also, if you have issues with some parts of the specification, feel free to create an issue in the aforementioned Github repo. (And in case you are wondering, yes we are planning to file the approach as a [SPARQL Enhancement Proposal (SEP)](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/tree/main/SEP) for the [SPARQL-dev Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/sparql-dev/)).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena website](https://github.com/apache/jena-site/)\r\n - [ ] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [ ] Key commit messages start with the issue number

Fixed by regex.\r\n* `href='...'` - Eclispe complains when this is in `@see` or `@param`. It accepts `\"`.  Fixed by regex.\r\n* Add `@SuppressWarnings(\"javadoc\")` where a nested class is named. `Foo.Bar`. Despite the in-IDE javadoc seeming to work, it's warning and only correctable by incliding the full package name or suppression. This PR suppress the warning.\r\n* Remove unnecessary `@SuppressWarnings(\"unused\")`\r\n* `Created by @szz` -- a few of these. `@` is not good! Jena does not have `@author` so these are removed inline with that.\r\n* `UnionGraphTest` - extend `GraphMem2Fast` not deprecated `GraphMem`\r\n\r\n@sszuev --\r\nThis one that look like a problem:
