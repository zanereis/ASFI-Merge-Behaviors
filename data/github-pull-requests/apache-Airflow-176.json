when the Kubernetes executor creates a pod it prints a dictionary description of the pod across many lines (can easily be 20+ lines). This is fine if you're reading the log in a stream in a text file, but throws off log search tools like Kibana. A better practice would be to print the whole pod description on a single line. It is quite easy to prettify a dictionary if one wants to see it back in a more human-friendly form with the newlines.\r\n\r\nThis update simply forces the log from this command into a single line.","created_at":"2021-09-20T15:48:01Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T20:19:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T20:19:41Z","merged_at":"2021-09-21T20:19:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7808be7ffb693de2e4ea73d0c1e6e2470cde9095","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

isolation level for the MSSQL database is READ_COMMITTED\r\nbut its implementation in MSSQL might cause random deadlocks for\r\nselect queries - because by default MSSQL uses shared locks\r\nfor READ_COMMITTED transaction isolation that might cause\r\ndeadlocks with the UPDATE statements which create exclusive\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\nThis change switches the MSSQL DB used during tests to have\r\nREAD_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOTS enabled and it adds check at the Airflow\r\nstartup to make sure that if the MSSQL database is used, the\r\nREAD_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOTS is set and documentation is added to\r\ndescribe it.\r\n\r\nIt also allows to revert removal of 2017 version of mssql which\r\nwas done in the faith that removal of 2017 will remove the\r\nflaky random test failures.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This is due to race condition for the session object.\r\nIt happens as dependency checker tries to access **ti.execution_date** attribute which is **lazily** loaded and when load is required the session is not available anymore as it was created temporarily for the duration _get_ti call. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by creating session beforehand and propagating to downstream. This helps avoiding of creating multiple sessions and making sure session is available when this lazy attribute is accessed.\r\n\r\nI have also took opportunity to fix a typo for  \"**create_if_necssary**\" -> \"**create_if_necessary**\"\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing!\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@c10237c871db:/opt/airflow/airflow/cli/commands# airflow tasks failed-deps my_dag print_date

lot of users have an expectations that Airflow Scheduler will\r\n`just work` and deliver the `optimal performance` for them without\r\nrealising that in case of such comples systems as Airflow is you\r\noften have to decide what you should optimise for or accept some\r\ntrade-offs or increase hardware capacity if you are not willing to\r\nmake those trade-offs.\r\n\r\nAlso it's not clear where the responsibility\r\nis - should it `just work` or should the user be responsible for\r\nunderstanding and fine tuning their system (both approaches are\r\npossible, there are some complex systmes which utilise a lot of\r\nautomation/AI etc. to fine tune and optmise their behaviour but\r\nAirflow expects from the users to know a bit more on how the\r\nscheduling works and Airflow maintainers deliver a lot of\r\nknobs that can be turned to fine tune the system and to make\r\ntrade-off decisions. This was not explicitely stated in our\r\ndocumentation and users could have different expectations about\r\nit (and they often had judging from issues they raised).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a \"fine-tuning\" chapter that aims to set the\r\nexpectations of the users at the right level - it explains what\r\nAirflow provides, but also what is the user's responsibility - to\r\ndecide what they are optimising, to see where their bottlenecks\r\nare and to decide if they need to change the configuration or\r\nincrease hardware capacity (or make appropriate trade-offs).\r\n\r\nIt also brings more of the fine-tuning parameters to the\r\n`tuneables` section of scheduler, based on some of the recent\r\nquestions asked by the users - seems that having a specific\r\noverview of all performance-impacting parameters is a good idea,\r\nand we only had a very limited subset of those.\r\n\r\nSome user prefer `watch` rather than read that's why this PR\r\nalso adds the link to the recording of talk from the\r\nAirlfow Summit 2021 where Ash describes - in a very concise\r\nand easy to grasp way - all the whys and hows of the scheduler.\r\nIf you understand why and how the scheduler does what it does,\r\nfine-tuning decisions are much easier.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

test uses the current timestamp and sleep to test `retry_delay`. This is nondeterministic and fails on my local machine as it takes longer than 3 seconds to execute the first two runs. The `retry_delay` code was originally written using `datetime.datetime.now`, which is a built-in method and probably could not be easily patched without affecting other parts of the code that used `datetime.datetime`. However, now that `timezone.utcnow` is used, patching is possible. The logic of `timezone.utc` does need to be duplicated, though it is only two lines.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/87e98652d58198e4ef7146bdc7e1e8d87a7d2bae/airflow/utils/timezone.py#L53-L65\r\n\r\n---\r\nOriginal commit that added these tests: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/8051aa988d315ab5c54bf5dd8f6e931356c07c2e#diff-969c0712020e8472d8d78ae32190692cc1e8a3e16dc17f6977c8f87a1328adb7R142\r\n\r\nAt that time, `retry_delay` logic was done using `datetime.datetime.now`: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/8051aa988d315ab5c54bf5dd8f6e931356c07c2e/airflow/models.py#L928-L934\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR splits ad improves the installation-related documentation\r\nfor Airflow. The \"installation\" page had become overloaded\r\nwiht everything-but-the-kitchen-sink and it became rather\r\ndifficult to navigate and link to relevant sections.\r\n\r\nAlso there was not a single page where one could have an overview\r\non different installation methods possible, cases when\r\neach instalation works best as well as understanding what\r\nis involved in following each installation method in terms of\r\nmaintenance, and expectations that users should have when it\r\ncomes to what Apache Airflow Community provides.\r\n\r\nThe PR leaves the installation page as basically a summary of\r\nall installation methods with all above explained and links\r\nto detailed pages explaining prerequisites, dependencies,\r\ndatabase setup and supported versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

First issue\r\nOn the DAG page, in Chrome browser, when I double click on the DAG name (usually to copy the text to paste elsewhere), it always selects \"schedule\" on the right. This has been the case ever since I used Airflow on Chrome (2+ years).\r\n\r\n### Change summary:\r\nAdd a `<div />` as a divider, so that when I double click, Chrome doesn't try to also select \"schedule\" on the right.\r\n\r\nTested other browser:\r\nSafari on Mac isn't affected.\r\n\r\nGIF showing the issue. I am simply double-clicking on the DAG name, and you'll see that \"schedule\" on right gets selected.\r\n![Screen Recording 2021-09-15 at 3 10 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9601962/133516972-951c4216-1723-41b8-8ccb-d262b013b51c.gif)\r\n\r\n## Second issue\r\nWhen I drag to select the DAG name, if I go 1 pixel past the end of the name to the right, then it will select \"schedule\" on the far right. If a DAG name has a dash, then i can't just double-click to select the full thing, and rather I have to drag to select the full dag name.\r\n\r\nIt's an unpleasant user experience to always have to delete \"schedule\" from the name I copied, or to have to select down to the single last character exactly.\r\n\r\n### Change summary:\r\nadd a 40pixel margin to the right, so that there's 40 pixels of margin for dragging to highlight.\r\n\r\nGIF of behavior without the change:\r\n![before-highlight-airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9601962/133517916-9ad6dc19-88ff-4a09-ab27-f01795c7def1.gif)\r\n\r\nGIF of behavior after adding a 40px margin:\r\n![after-highlight-airflow mov](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9601962/133517927-3d7424e0-7abb-43c8-9c70-7cdbcc088246.gif)\r\n\r\nSize of the margin:\r\n<img width=\"586\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-15 at 3 25 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9601962/133518037-a1fa51f2-72fa-469b-8484-9077f7b0c9c1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the stack trace above, this line here shows that the name is read from the kube_config.pod_template_file: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/db720743c5f5828fabed9dd88384c86a41e2f997/airflow/kubernetes/worker_configuration.py#L437 \r\n- In the Airflow Helm chart 1.1.0, only the scheduler has the pod_template_file mounted. So when this action was triggered, the webserver does not have the pod_template file mounted and couldn't fill in the values here. \r\n- This PR patches the webserver K8s template to also mount the pod_template_file the same way the schedule does here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daa725b9f359c23a374a808ad53bbd7ecefce0d9/chart/templates/scheduler/scheduler-deployment.yaml#L141 so that when the code path is exercised, `name` is filled in from the value read in the pod template file.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the global \"uid\" and \"gid\" with a per deployment securityContext setting.\r\n\r\nFields are configured as follows:\r\n```\r\npodSecurity:\r\n  default:\r\n    securityContext:\r\n      runAsUser: 50000\r\n      fsGroup: 0\r\n      runAsGroup: 0\r\n    containerSecurityContext:\r\n      runAsUser: 50000\r\n      runAsGroup: 0\r\n  webserver:\r\n    securityContext:\r\n      enabled: false\r\n    containerSecurityContext:\r\n      enabled: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default will be used in case the individual setting is disabled.\r\n\r\nThis change allows for more configurability and allows the usage of arbitrary securityContexts as permitted by the official docker images.\r\nThe issue #18136 still requires the PR #18147 for Openshift clusters since there is no option to remove securityContexts altogether.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmake `current_user_has_permissions` backwards compatible\r\nIMHO subclasses that already override `get_current_user_permissions` should not also have to override the newly added method `current_user_has_permissions` and this PR would fix that. \r\n\r\nCurrently `AiflowSecurityManager.current_user_has_permissions` sort of duplicates logic of `AiflowSecurityManager.get_current_user_permissions` but bakes in the assumption that all permissions come from roles. \r\n\r\nAs of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17838 the new method is used when deciding to route a user to the no permissions or role page.\r\n\r\nThis causes a regression for existing subclasses of `AirflowSecurityManager` that override `get_current_user_permissions` directly and those permissions do not come from a role.\r\nSuch subclasses should still allow users with permissions to the airflow UI. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how best to add test coverage for something like this.\r\ncc @jedcunningham @andrewgodwin \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

PR proposes adding a few more type hints to places in `CeleryKubernetesExecutor` that are currently missing them.\r\n\r\nI think this change may improve the ability of static analysis tools like `mypy` to catch the types of issues caught by type checkers (e.g. attempting to apply a method that isn't compatible with a given object's type).\r\n\r\n### Notes for Reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd like to submit more small PRs like this on other parts of the Airflow API where I see missing type hints. Would you support such contributions? Or are some places missing hints for reasons I don't understand, like limiting the cost of running type-checkers?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and consideration.","created_at":"2021-09-13T21:16:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T10:07:40Z","closed_at":"2021-10-09T16:48:54Z","merged_at":"2021-10-09T16:48:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"420367d843301e9fc942019586bc9f90f6680ece","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

#18124\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two main issues with the current `AzureDataExplorerHook`:\r\n1. The custom `Azure Data Explorer` connection fields mappings for `Tenant ID` and `Authentication Method` are switched so the hook cannot properly use the values specified.\r\n2. There `get_required_params()` method is passed invalid values and will always raise an exception for a missing required parameter.  These invalid values are from the classic `Extras` fields in the connection form which is no longer exposed in the `Azure Data Explorer` connection type.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there are minor updates made to the hook's docstring for information accuracy and correct rendering of Airflow docs as well as small spelling/grammar changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead
