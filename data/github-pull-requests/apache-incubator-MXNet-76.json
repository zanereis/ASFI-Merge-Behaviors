##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix \"Not enough argument to call operator softmax_cross_entropy\" issue for softmax_cross_entropy operator.\r\n- [x] Change output to be shape (batch_size,), which is consistent with gluon softmax

Description ##\r\nThis is a continued work of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7910 addressing https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8084.\r\nImplementation based upon Numpy's [indexing documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html#advanced-indexing).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support NDArray `__setitem__` and `__getitem__` using advanced indices **excluding** Numpy Ellipsis(...), newaxis, and [boolean array indexing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html#boolean-array-indexing). When index is a single list, only a list of integers is supported. Nested lists as indices is supported when index is a tuple of basic and advanced indices. That is, `a[[1, 2]]` is supported, `a[[[1], [2]]]` is NOT supported, but `a[1, [[1], [2]], [1, 2], 2:5]` is supported.\r\n- [x] Support NDArray indexing using slices with arbitrary value of `step`.\r\n- [x] Re-implemented operators `slice`, `_slice_assign`, and `_slice_assign_scalar` using `Kernel::Launch` and support `step != 1`.\r\n- [x] Fixed this issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8164\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims at providing auto-complete for text editors by actually writing the generated op functions to module source codes. The solution should work for pip/setuptools install command. `python setup.py develop` should remain runtime-generated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Decouple code generation and function registration. Existing tests already covered this change.\r\n- [x] Write generated code to source files as part of the post-install script of install-command.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Backward compatible.\r\n- This change should not affect `python setup.py develop`.\r\n- Since pip uses a separate `setup.py`, another change will happen in the distro package to take effect in

dockerfile](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tests/ci_build/pip_tests/Dockerfile.pip_dependencies) to install libfortran3 which is required for pip testing. \r\nI manually reproduced this issue on a host machine and verified that this change fixes the issue. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nI tried some other suggestions available online like 'export' but they do not fix the issue (the .so does not exist on the docker at all). \r\nWhile I have done some manual testing I will monitor it to make sure it works once merged.

Description ###\r\nFixes segfaults in kvstore_dist for row sparse, and fixes tests in dist_sync_kvstore\r\n@eric-haibin-lin and I worked on this.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. Move copying of indices to happen before ZPull, because after ZPull we release the locks and the later function don't see actual variable\r\n2. nullptr was not handled for offsets variable\r\n3. fixes tests which were broken when WaitToWrite was removed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8116 . Also added comments describing how they are no guarantees for (immediate) consecutive pushes\r\n4. Removed the usage of reference in BroadcastRowSparse to keep it consistent with style of Broadcast\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\nWhen pushes happen one after the other, without a pull in between, there is no ordering guarantee we provide now that the `WaitToWrite` was removed in #8116  for performance reasons. The second push may start and finish before first push finishes\r\n\r\nPlease comment if we missed something, or if you have any suggestions, or if any clarifications are needed.

a generic implementation for all random samplers that can run on cpu and gpu. \r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n\r\n- This will fail until PR297 is merged into mshadow\r\n\r\n- The design pattern adopted for GPU is to generate as many random seeds as samples should be drawn and then draw each sample using its own randstate. This is a pattern that is considered to be ok according to Nvidia documentation. There is a theoretical chance that the generated random sequences by the individual randstates are somehow correlated but Nvidia claims that they never observed such an effect and just want to mention that they can't prove that it can never happen theoretically. So in practice, this should generated high-quality uncorrelated samples. \r\n\r\n- Above design pattern is also ok w.r.t. setup time of the randstates as we use consistently sequence 0 of the randstate (so the setup does not have to skip through multiple sequences when initializing). Again according to Nvidia. \r\n\r\n- I decided to use a consistent design pattern even for uniform/normal distributions as this makes the code more consistent. \r\n\r\n- The design pattern allows easy implementation of all types of rejection sampling methods, so we should be able to add other distributions easily whenever we need them. \r\n\r\n- Above pattern will automatically enable multi-threaded sampling on CPU if openMP is on.\r\n\r\n- The sampling methods for exponential/gamma/Poisson/negative Binomial are all standard and mostly the same as STL uses. The rejection method for big lambdas for the Poisson-distribution is slightly different but also theoretically sound (reference in the code)\r\n\r\n- There is a bit of a problem for the case of fp16. Basically there do not exist any samplers that natively work on this limited precision. I don't know why we recently  added fp16 as a valid output for random sampling operators. We should have never done this but instead insist that an explicit casting operator must be used that then can also handle all issues of overflow/underflow in a centralized way. Anyway, somehow this got added which causes the problem that we have to convert fp32 samples to fp16 and as these are samples from a distribution, there is always the chance of an overflow. Ugly. This was already the case in the prior implementation, so it is not newly introduced here. And IMO, we should not solve it within the samplers but instead by a separate casting operator. \r\n\r\n- Adding additional outputs/functionalities to the random sampler such as re-parametrization, CDF etc is not part of this PR. We should add it as a separate step.

proposed by @fhieber in #6996 this PR helps reduce memory usage when using smoothing during softmax computation by doing the smoothing directly in the operator.  This modification was tested by @tdomhan and I and we found it reduced memory usage during training on a typical MT model by ~ 3GB.  \r\n\r\nThis PR should be backwards compatible.  \r\n\r\nThis PR
