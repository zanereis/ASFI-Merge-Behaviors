is possible that log start offset may fall in the middle of the batch after AdminClient#deleteRecords(). This will cause a follower starting from log start offset to fail fetching (all records). Use-cases when a follower will start fetching from log start offset includes: 1) new replica due to partition re-assignment; 2) new local replica created as a result of AdminClient#AlterReplicaLogDirs(); 3) broker that was down for some time while AdminClient#deleteRecords() move log start offset beyond its HW. \r\n\r\nAdded two integration tests:\r\n1) Produce and

PR aims to enforce that the controller can only update zookeeper states after checking the controller epoch zkVersion. The check and zookeeper state updates are wrapped in the zookeeper multi() operations to ensure that they are done atomically. This PR is necessary to resolve issues related to multiple controllers (i.e. old controller updates zookeeper states before resignation, which is possible during controller failover based on the single threaded event queue model we have)\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n- Add MultiOp request and response in ZookeeperClient\r\n- Ensure all zookeeper updates done by controller are protected by checking the current controller epoch zkVersion\r\n- Modify test cases in KafkaZkClientTest to test mismatch controller epoch zkVersion\r\n\r\nTests Done:\r\n- Unit tests (with updated tests to test mismatch controller epoch zkVersion)\r\n- Existing integration tests + newly added test cases in ControllerIntegrationTest\r\n- Perf testing: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5101#issuecomment-418243421. Test results show that there is no performance overhead before and after this patch for common controller operations including controller failover, preferred replica leader election, and broker shutdown/startup.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-30T23:31:22Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T14:01:19Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T21:20:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e062ebd3cde48a3d92646a76bc01cc88c77b3c4c","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/milestones/3","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/milestone/3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/milestones/3/labels","id":3427062,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzQyNzA2Mg==","number":3,"title":"2.1.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":4,"state":"open","created_at":"2018-06-15T06:37:16Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T03:37:55Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/239593aa92c6816162397fb2a57a908d35662c46","head":{"label":"hzxa21:KAFKA-6082","ref":"KAFKA-6082","sha":"239593aa92c6816162397fb2a57a908d35662c46","user":{"login":"hzxa21","id":5518566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5518566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21","html_url":"https://github.com/hzxa21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fal

commit allows secrets in Connect configs to be externalized and replaced with variable references of the form `${provider:[path:]key}`, where the \"path\" is optional.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main additions to `org.apache.kafka.common.config`: a `ConfigProvider` and a `ConfigTransformer`.  The `ConfigProvider` is an interface that allows key-value pairs to be provided by an external source for a given \"path\".  An a TTL can be associated with the key-value pairs returned from the path.  The `ConfigTransformer` will use instances of `ConfigProvider` to replace variable references in a set of configuration values.\r\n\r\nIn the Connect framework, `ConfigProvider` classes can be specified in the worker config, and then variable references can be used in the connector config.  In addition, the herder can be configured to restart connectors (or not) based on the TTL returned from a `ConfigProvider`.  The main class that performs restarts and transformations is `WorkerConfigTransformer`.  \r\n\r\nFinally, a `configs()` method has been added to both `SourceTaskContext` and `SinkTaskContext`.  This allows connectors to get configs with variables replaced by the latest values from instances of `ConfigProvider`.\r\n\r\nMost of the other changes in the Connect framework are threading various objects through classes to enable the above functionality.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-23T00:06:50Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T02:09:57Z","closed_at":"2018-05-30T21:45:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e687801eb766a1e317063c8f58e8449304039c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/acee01140480efd529d17c8412edc6c6990368bf","head":{"label":"rayokota:KAFKA-6886-connect-secrets","ref":"KAFKA-6886-connect-secrets","sha":"acee01140480efd529d17c8412edc6c6990368bf","user":{"login":"rayokota","id":1761488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjE0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1761488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota","html_url":"https://github.com/rayokota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118517786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTg1MTc3ODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"rayokota/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rayokota","id":1761488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjE0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1761488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota","html_url":"https://github.com/rayokota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayokota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rayokota/kafka","description":"Mirror

#4919 we propagate the SerDes for each of these aggregation operators.\r\n\r\nAs @guozhangwang mentioned in that PR:\r\n> reduce: inherit the key and value serdes from the parent XXImpl class.\r\n> count: inherit the key serdes, enforce setting the Serdes.Long() for value serdes.\r\n> aggregate: inherit the key serdes, **do not set for value serdes internally**.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's all good for `reduce` and `count`, it is quiet unsafe to have `aggregate` without `Materialized` given.

PR implements the features described in this KIP: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-298%3A+Error+Handling+in+Connect\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the Connect framework to allow it to automatically deal with errors encountered while processing records in a Connector. The following behavior changes are introduced here:\r\n\r\n**Retry on Failure**: Retry the failed operation a configurable number of times, with backoff between each retry.\r\n**Task Tolerance Limits**: Tolerate a configurable number of failures in a task.\r\n\r\nWe also add the following ways to report errors, along with sufficient context to simplify the debugging process:\r\n\r\n**Log Error Context**: The error information along with processing context is logged along with standard application logs.\r\n**Dead Letter Queue**: Produce the original message into a Kafka topic (applicable only to sink connectors).\r\n\r\nNew **metrics** which will monitor the number of failures, and the behavior of the response handler are added.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here **are backward compatible**. The current behavior in Connect is to kill the task on the first error in any stage. This will remain the default behavior if the connector does not override any of the new configurations which are provided as part of this feature.\r\n\r\nTesting: added multiple unit tests to test the retry and tolerance logic.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

PR is a continuation from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/4830. I create a new PR because the original PR got big and it looks like some reviewers are having problems with loading it. I also used a new branch. \r\n\r\nThis implements KIP-219, where a broker return a response with throttle time on quota violation immediately after processing the corresponding request. After the response is sent out, the broker will keep the channel muted until the throttle time is over. Also, on receiving a response with throttle time, client will also block outgoing communication to the broker for the specified throttle time.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit
