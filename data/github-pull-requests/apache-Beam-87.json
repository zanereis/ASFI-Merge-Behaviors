It contains static `PTransform` classes that represents reads/writes within the I/O (e.g. `Read`, `Write`).\r\n\r\n![package drawio (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/157455025-1a58eb9d-0930-4a83-aaa2-9c226fe0281d.png)\r\n\r\n`CdapIO.<~>read()` method method starts constructing a `CdapIO.Read` transform, it receives a type parameters`<~>` that specify the output type for CDAP source.\r\nThe `Read` class implements an interface similar to the builder pattern and has simple `withX()` methods for passing configuration and other settings needed before start reading from CDAP source:\r\n- `withCdapPluginClass()` - pass a source/sink plugin class marked with CDAP `@Plugin` annotation. (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSource.class`) \r\n- `withPluginConfig()`- pass a corresponding `PluginConfig` object (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSourceConfig.class`)\r\n- `withKeyClass()` - specify the key class for the output (e.g. `NullWritable.class`)\r\n- `withValueClass()`- specify the value class for the output (e.g. `StructuredRecord.class`)\r\n\r\nInside the `.withCdapPluginClass()` method, the `CdapPlugin` object is constructed. `CdapPlugin` object contains the following information about CDAP plugin:\r\n- Bounded/Unbounded\r\n- Input/Output\r\n- `BatchContextImpl` object for stubbing some CDAP-specific behavior\r\n- Format / Key / Value classes needed for filling Hadoop `Configuration` object\r\n- `T cdapPluginObj` for performing `prepareRun()` call before reading\r\n\r\nThe following steps are performed in the `Read.expand()` method:\r\n- Validating that all configs and other obligatory fields are set\r\n- Call `CdapPlugin.prepareRun()` method before reading (see javadoc)\r\n- Construct the needed `Read` transform depending on whether the `CdapPlugin` is bounded / unbounded:\r\n- - For bounded sources `HadoopFormatIO.<K, V>read()` method is called passing filled Hadoop `Configuration` object.\r\n- - For unbounded sources `SparkReceiverIO.<~>read()` method is called.\r\n\r\n![156-seq drawio(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/155947282-342fa263-66c4-45f9-9ac1-2863f563138e.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, the dependency report tries to generate Jiras, but we're not using Jira anymore and aren't tracking these through issues at all anymore (instead we use dependabot). This conservatively keeps the report generation around for a while, but gets rid of the Jira component. I anticipate in the long run we will no longer file the report and will instead rely solely on Dependabot.\r\n\r\nPart of #21684 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#21478\r\nRe implement with dynamic read using Watch transform instead of trying to use @OnTimer.\r\n\r\nOnTimer doesn't trigger properly, because there is only one input to the existing DoFn. As such, it will emit the current set of partitions, but never pick up any new partitions.\r\n\r\nThis change is to re-implement the same idea using the Watch transform, which takes a function, and calls it on a period. Each time that function is called, the Watch transform will emit any new elements returned by that function that haven't previously been returned.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this wasn't sufficiently tested previously, so an integration test has been added to ensure that it works as expected.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the way we compute watermarks for the Spanner change stream connector.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we computed watermarks by updating the watermark column in the Spanner metadata table continuously based on received data change records. Then, we would compute the minimum of all watermarks in the Spanner metadata table and output that as the watermark in the DetectNewPartitionsAction function.\r\n\r\nNow, we rely on the Dataflow watermarking mechanism to compute watermarks. For the ReadChangeStreamPartitionDoFn stage, we delay a DoFn instance from stopping until all child partitions have started running. This will prevent the watermark from jumping ahead in scenarios where the parent ends, but the child hasn't started yet, allowing the watermark to jump past the child's start time.\r\n\r\nThis will have the following benefits:\r\n- Remove the use of BundleFinalizer in the code, allowing the connector to run on both Dataflow runner v1 and v2\r\n- Reduce the load on the Spanner metadata table, since we no longer need to continuously write to the watermark column.\r\n\r\nDesign doc:

was driven by a script that uses the mapping generated during the jira -> GH Issues migration. It takes all Jira links that aren't in CHANGES.md or the blog and maps them to the corresponding issue. This may not be comprehensive, but it moves the large majority of issues and helps set that as the standard going forward.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend doing an audit review of this rather than going line by line. I did a full line by line review and caught a few string issues, but for the most part the tool did its job.\r\n\r\nPart of #21686\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Create a DSL script for performance benchmark test using RunInference API.\r\n\r\nThe tests consists of vision and NLP domains. Vision compares the performance `Resnet 101` and `Resnet 152` on the pytorch_image_classification.py using DataflowRunner. NLP compares the performance of `bert-base-uncased` and `bert-large-uncased` on the pytorch_language_modeling.py using DataflowRunner.\r\n\r\n3.

PR has two related, but technically independent efforts. \r\n\r\n**1. Support for batched keyed examples.**\r\nWe currently only support ability to pass in a single Tensor that does not have any keys attached to it: `model(batched_input)`. We want to support passing in key-batched values to pytorch model via kwargs in model() call. like so: `model(**batched_inputs)`.\r\n\r\nImplementation: Because of the way Beam returns BatchElements(), we will convert a list of (key to Tensor) dicts into a dict of Tensor lists.\r\n\r\n**2. Support for non-batchable kwargs params.**\r\nWe want to support the ability to pass in non-batchable kwargs params to RunInference models, particularly for Pytorch.\r\n\r\nThis adds the `**kwargs` as an argument to `RunInference`. Since the original motivation was for Pytorch models, we added an interpreted parameter `prediction_params` to the PytorchInferenceRunner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nNote: This is a squash of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17470/ so that we can make a distinction in the commit

PR adds two new decorators, `@yields_batches` and `@yields_elements`, which override the default interpretation for the output of `DoFn.process` and `DoFn.process_batch`. These decorators are handled via changes to `OutputProcessor` (now renamed to `OutputHandler` for clarity), which branches depending on whether batches or elements are expected in the `results` iterable.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, common logic in `OutputHandler` was extracted into private helper methods that are re-used. The .pxd definition for these methods indicates they should be inlined in cython-generated code so they don't affect performance.\r\n\r\nFixes #21656\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

frees one from being restricted to invoking already existing,\r\nnamed transform.\r\n\r\nThere are two variants:\r\n\r\n  The first, easiest to use, allows one to specify a Python callable\r\n  that is then invoked on with the input as the first parameter.\r\n\r\n  The second allows one to define and return an entire PTransform, which\r\n  can be useful if other properties need to be set (such as
