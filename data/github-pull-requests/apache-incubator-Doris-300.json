Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\ncherry-pick #13368 and some other modify\r\n\r\nPreviously, bthread_getspecific was called every time bthread local was used. In the test at https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/10823, it was found that frequent calls to bthread_getspecific had performance problems.\r\n\r\nSo a cache is implemented on pthread local based on the btls key, but the btls key cannot correctly sense bthread switching.\r\n\r\nSo, based on bthread_self to get the bthread id to implement the cache.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe should consider memory which are being flushed from memtable to disk when trying to reduce memory by flushing memtable. Otherwise, we might not release memory space as expected. (e.g. lots of large memtable is in flush, the `reduce_mem_usage` method picks some small memtables to flush, it can't release enough memory and also can generate lots of small segments, which can cause -238 error)\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### Remove the memory of the brpc Closure from the query\r\n- In data stream sender, brpc client serialize `Request` memory in `transmit_block()`, release in `closure->cntl.Reset()`, and remove them from query mem tracker.\r\n```\r\nStatus VDataStreamSender::Channel::send_block(PBlock* block, bool eos) {\r\n    SCOPED_TIMER(_parent->_brpc_send_timer);\r\n    if (_closure == nullptr) {\r\n        _closure = new RefCountClosure<PTransmitDataResult>();\r\n        _closure->ref();\r\n    } else {\r\n

server deserializes the `Request` memory within the server and releases it in `done->Run()`, which removes the latter from the query mem tracker.\r\n```\r\nvoid PInternalServiceImpl::_transmit_block(google::protobuf::RpcController* cntl_base,\r\n                                           const PTransmitDataParams* request,\r\n

sh build.sh`\r\n- be.conf add: `tc_enable_aggressive_memory_decommit=true`\r\n- session variables add: \r\n```\r\nset global exec_mem_limit=285899345920;\r\nset

Proposed changes\r\nImplement predicate pushdown in `OrcReader` by converting doris `ColumnValueRange` to orc `SearchArgument`.\r\n\r\n## Remaining problems\r\n1. Orc support `not in`, which may have effect on bloom filter. However, doris `ScanNode` has not push down `not in` to file scanner.\r\n2. Orc support `is null`, and row range has `hasNull` identifier. However,  `_contain_null` in `ColumnValueRange` is ambiguous. `_contain_null = true` only means that the value can be nullable, not equal to null.\r\n3. `DateTimeV2` has lost microsecond precision in `ColumnValueRange`, which may cause filtering error when a min-max value equals to the predicate value.\r\n4. `DateTimeV1`  is not accurate enough, and only saved to seconds.\r\n5. Orc support the predicate pushdown of `float&double` type, but doris has not push down `float&double` type for precision reason.\r\n\r\n## Performance test\r\nUsing one thread to query data in table with 10 million rows, and the table is generated from a [data generator tool](https://github.com/glebkorolkov/datagen) with all types supported by hive, and all values are random, and has a 10% probability of being null.\r\n| Type | Predicate | Before opt.<br>Time / (scan rows) | After opt.<br>Time / (scan rows) |\r\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\r\n| int | int_col > 999874452 | 0.82s<br>10000000 | 0.49s<br>2754994 |\r\n| date<br>(datev2) | date_col < date '2012-09-08' | 4.05s<br>10000000 | 1.05s<br>2579997 |\r\n| timestamp<br>(datetimev2) | timestamp_col > timestamp '2022-09-05 21:34:44.000' | 3.41s<br>10000000 | 0.63s<br>950000 |\r\n| decimal<br>(decimalv2) | decimal_col < 100032.0057 | 1.06s<br>10000000 | 0.59s<br>1685001 |\r\n| bigint | bigint_col < 26495468801273 | 1.01s<br>10000000 | 0.55s<br>1874999 |\r\n| string | select count(string_col) from types_sf1_r1000w where string_col <= 'A d' | 7.73s<br>10000000 | 4.17s<br>3404995 |\r\n| mix | int_col <= 14019 and decimal_col < 338745.937 and date_col = date '2014-10-08'; | 9.41s<br>10000000 | 2.40s<br>1854998 |\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n7. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n8. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n9. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n10. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis PR unified the selection of rollup index and materialized view index into uniform logic, which is called selecting materialized index. \r\n\r\nMain steps:\r\n\r\n### Find candidate indexes\r\n1. When aggregate is present, it's handled in `SelectMaterializedIndexWithAggregate`.  The base index and indexes that could use pre-aggregation should be used. The pre-aggregation status is determined by aggregation function, grouping expression, and pushdown predicates.\r\n2. When aggregate is not on top of scan node, it's handled in `SelectMaterializedIndexWithoutAggregate`. The base index and indexes that have all the key columns could be used.\r\n\r\n### Filter and order the candidate indexes\r\n1. filter indexes that contain all the required output scan columns.\r\n1. filter indexes that could match prefix index most.\r\n1. order the result index by row count, column count, and index id.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Null values will break up the batch insertion of ParquetReader, so when the data contains null values, the performance of OrcReader is better than ParquetReader. We will optimize such case for ParquetReader in later PR.\r\n2. Using apache orc c++ api to read orc file, will introduce additional overhead of converting orc batch to doris block.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, ExprId in Nereids is generated by a global gnerator and shared by all statement. There are three problems:\r\n1. ExprId could out of bound\r\n2. hard to debug\r\n3. could not use bitset to present ExprId set\r\n\r\nThis PR solve this problem by new Id generator for each statement. after this PR ExprId always start from 0 for each statement.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. refactor all place that new StatementContext in test code to ensure the logic is same with main code.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

However, in many industries, such as the financial industry, the length of the derived fields often exceeds 64 characters, so adjust the regular The rules are from 64 characters to 128 characters. Many users load data from Hive to Doris through appearance or BrokerLoad. Arabic numerals can be used as the first letter in the Hive table, so the regular rules are adjusted to support Arabic numerals as the first letter.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nPreviously, `bthread_getspecific` was called every time bthread local was used. In the test at https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/10823, it was found that frequent calls to `bthread_getspecific` had performance problems.\r\n\r\nSo a cache is implemented on pthread local based on the btls key, but the btls key cannot correctly sense bthread switching.\r\n\r\nSo, based on `bthread_self` to get the bthread id to implement the cache.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n`gperftools/tcmalloc`[https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools] is outdated, there are no new features for many years, only fix bugs. doris is currently used by default.\r\n\r\n`google/tcmalloc`[https://github.com/google/tcmalloc], very active recently, has many new features, and is expected to perform better than jemalloc, but there is currently no stable version.\r\nMoreover, the compilation dependencies are complex and difficult to integrate, and are incompatible with `gperftools/tcmalloc`, and there are few reference documents.\r\n\r\n`jemalloc`[https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc] performs better than `gperftools/tcmalloc` under high concurrency, and is mature and stable, looking forward to being the default memory allocator.\r\n  Tested in Doris: https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/12496\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,
