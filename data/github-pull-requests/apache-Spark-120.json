for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a93044550259fa0ee8897d0576f6eeac8ec73c27 introduced `enableDateTimeParsingFallback` config but the usage was incorrect in CSV/UnivocityParser - DateType and TimestampType configs were swapped.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue so `enableParsingFallbackForDateType` controls DateType fallback and `enableParsingFallbackForTimestampType` controls TimestampType.\r\n\r\nJSON does not have this problem - the property is correctly used for the corresponding data types in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/json/JacksonParser.scala#L305.\r\n\r\nSetting parsing fallback via data source option or SQL config will work correctly, the issue would only happen when using `dateFormat` or `timestampFormat` without setting the flag explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCorrectness fix. Without the change, the fallback would not be enabled when using dateFormat and timestampFormat. All other means to set parsing fallback (data source option and SQLConf) will still work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test for CSV and JSON to reproduce the issue and verify it was fixed.","created_at":"2022-09-20T07:29:06Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T05:33:21Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T05:17:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9324fa306af777fb9a81eef3afc6577f51457cb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37942/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37942/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37942/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a9f1fb9c604233f84a0b42b635a6b3b49b9cc32","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-40496","ref":"SPARK-40496","sha":"1a9f1fb9c604233f84a0b42b635a6b3b49b9cc32","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-17321, `YarnShuffleService` will persist data to local shuffle state db/reload data from local shuffle state db only when Yarn NodeManager start with `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED = true`.\r\n\r\n`YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` not set `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` and the default value of the configuration is false,  so `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` will neither trigger data persistence to the db nor verify the reload of data.\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to let `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite` restart the verification of registeredExecFile reload scenarios, to achieve this goal, this pr make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new un-document configuration `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing` to `YarnShuffleService`, and Initialize `_recoveryPath` when `_recoveryPath == null && spark.yarn.shuffle.testing == true`.\r\n\r\n2. Only set `spark.yarn.shuffle.testing = true` in `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`, and add assertions to check `registeredExecFile` is not null to ensure that registeredExecFile reload scenarios will be verified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix registeredExecFile reload  test scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhy not test by configuring `YarnConfiguration#NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED` as true?\r\n\r\nThis configuration has been tried\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 3.3.4**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationWithLevelDBBackendSuite -Phadoop-3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1710230Z Cause: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.shaded.org.iq80.leveldb.DBException\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1715234Z at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:387)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1719347Z at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:419)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1723090Z at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:352)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1726759Z at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:352)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1731028Z at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.initAndStartRecoveryStore(NodeManager.java:313)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1735424Z at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeManager.serviceInit(NodeManager.java:370)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1740303Z at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1745576Z at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$NodeManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:597)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1828858Z at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1829712Z at org.apache.hadoop.service.CompositeService.serviceInit(CompositeService.java:109)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1830633Z at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:327)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1831431Z at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n2022-09-10T11:44:42.1832279Z at org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.BaseYarnClusterSuite.beforeAll(BaseYarnClusterSuite.scala:112)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hadoop 2.7.4**\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationWithLevelDBBackendSuite -Phadoop-2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nYarnShuffleIntegrationWithLevelDBBackendSuite:\r\norg.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnShuffleIntegrationWithLevelDBBackendSuite *** ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot support recovery with an ephemeral server port.

read [go/dbr-dev-guides](https://go/dbr-dev-guides/) before creating a pull request against files shared between Databricks Runtime and open-source Apache Spark.\r\nFor example, this includes files under the `org.apache.spark` package path.\r\nIf in doubt, please reach out to a member of the open-source team for help.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd complex tests to `StreamingSessionWindowSuite`. Concretely, I created two helper functions, \r\n- one is called `sessionWindowQueryNestedKey`, which would convert `sessionId` from the single word key used in `sessionWindowQuery` to a nested column key. For example: `\"hello\" -> ((\"hello\", \"hello\"), \"hello\")`.\r\n- The other is called `sessionWindowQueryMultiColKey`. It would convert `sessionId` from the single word key used in `sessionWindowQuery` to two columns. For example: \"hello\" -> col1: (\"hello\", \"hello\"), col2: \"hello\"\r\n\r\nWith the two new helper functions, I added more tests for the tests for `complete mode` and `cap gap duration` (`append` and `async state` was not included, because the first two is enough for testing the change I added). The logic of the tests are not changed at all, just the key.\r\n\r\nFor the aggregation test (`session window - with more aggregation functions`), I added some more functions as well as a UDAF to test, and I tried `first()` and `last()` function on a nested triple, created using the same method as the above. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease fill in changes proposed in this fix.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAll are

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore unload of a StateStore, perform a cleanup.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent the maintenance of StateStore is performed by a periodic task in the management thread. If a streaming query become inactive before the next maintenance task fire, its StateStore will be unloaded before cleanup. \r\nThere are 2 cases when a StateStore is unloaded.\r\n1. StateStoreProvider is not longer active in the system, for example, when a query ends or the spark context terminates.\r\n2. There is other active StateStoreProvider in the system, for example, when a partition is reassigned.\r\n\r\nIn case 1, we should do one last maintenance before unloading the instance,\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShutdown delay of a query may increase because a maintenance task is scheduled.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd an integration test that verify that redundant delta file is deleted when StateStore instances is deactivated and unloaded. \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-19T21:49:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T02:45:45Z","closed_at":"2022-09-26T02:45:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81835dac745ce4a8750711d4696e3d356eb6c60f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR corrects the behavior of how columns with mixed dates and timestamps are supported in CSV schema inference and data parsing.\r\n- If user specifies timestamp format, this type of columns will always be inferred as `StringType`.\r\n- If no timestamp format specified by user,  we will try inferring this type of columns as `TimestampType` if possible, otherwise inferred as `StringType`\r\n\r\nHere are the semantics of the changes:\r\n- In `CSVInferSchema`\r\n  - Remove the attempts to infer field as `DateType` when `prefersDate=true` and `typeSoFar=TimestampType/TimestampNTZType`\r\n  - Change the dataType merging behavior between `DateType` and `TimestampType/TimestampNTZType`:\r\n    - If the `timestampFormat/timestampNTZFormat` is given, merge the two types into StringType\r\n    - Otherwise\r\n      - if the `dateFormat` could be parsed by the lenient timestamp formatter, merge the two types into `TimestampType/TimestampNTZType`\r\n      - otherwise, merge the two types into `StringType`\r\n\r\n- In `UnivocityParser`, remove the attempts to parse field as Date if it failed to be parsed as Timestamp. \r\n\r\nAs an additional change, this PR also turn the default value of `prefersDate` as `true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify CSV dateTime inference logic.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo compared to the previous PR.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Because the logical plan from the batch and the actual planned logical plan are mismatched. So, [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/ProgressReporter.scala#L348) we cannot find the plan and collect metrics correctly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by replacing the initial `LogicalPlan` with the `LogicalPlan` containing the metadata column\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + New

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to extend the available partitioning options for the JDBC data source.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPartitioning options allow to read data using multiple workers connected to the target RDBMS. This can improve the performance of data extraction, under the right circumstances.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only available partitioning and parallelization option for reading from databases is to specify lowerBound, upperBound, together with numPartitions and partitionColumn. The Spark JDBC data source will then use multiple partitions, and thus workers, to read from the RDBMS.   \r\nThis proposes to add a similar, however complementary, mechanism for partitioning, where a user-provided list of values is used to compute the target partitions.   \r\nThis provides a way to split the data extraction work among workers that could be aligned with the database physical (partitioned and/or indexed) structure, as in the following example:  \r\n```\r\noption(\"partitionColumn\", \"region\").\r\noption(\"numPartitions\", 3).\r\noption(\"partitionColValues\", \"'eastern', 'central', 'western'\").  \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature is motivated for performance reasons, to scale and speed up data extraction from:\r\n - list partitioned tables, available in Oracle and PostgreSQL\r\n - this is also applicable to tables stored in B*Tree indexes, such as in Oracle's IOTs (Index Organized Tables) and SQL Server's Clustered Indexes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this adds the option \"partitionColValues\" to the JDBC data source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to the JDBCSuite and JDBCV2Suite.\r\nAlso manually tested against Oracle's list partitioned tables.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-19T08:26:58Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T00:18:52Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T00:18:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"431afb4fd247820b2176daec660bf7ceaf43e1cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24df8778fb1c3bdd8e3ac585aa9c59f0ad9110b1","head":{"label":"LucaCanali:JDBCAddPartitionListValues","ref":"JDBCAddPartitionListValues","sha":"24df8778fb1c3bdd8e3ac585aa9c59f0ad9110b1","user":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145986175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU5ODYxNzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"LucaCanali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a config `spark.stage.ignoreDecommissionFetchFailure` to control whether ignore stage fetch failure caused by decommissioned executor when count `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts`\r\n\r\nFetch failure only be ignored when executors are in below condition:\r\n1. Waiting for decommission start\r\n2. Under decommission process\r\n\r\nFetch failure might not be ignored when executors are in below condition, but this is best effort approach based on current mechanism. \r\n1. Stopped or terminated after finishing decommission\r\n2. Under decommission process, then removed by driver with other reasons\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen executor decommission is enabled, there would be more stage failure caused by FetchFailed from decommissioned executor, further causing whole job's failure. One reason is decommissioning executor won't wait all FetchData requests to be finished, it will self-exit when no running tasks and migration finished. It would be better not to count such failure in `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts`. AWS EMR already supported this.

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCleanup merged shuffle data files after query finished.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n* After push merge service received FinalizeShuffleMerge RPC from driver, it will mark the MergePartitionsInfo as finilized instead of remove it.\r\n* Delete the shuffle merge files if partition.mapTracker is empty.\r\n* When spark driver begin to cleanup shuffle, if push-based shuffle is enabled, spark driver will send RemoveShuffleMerge RPC to all merger locations to delete all merge data files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere will be too many merged shuffle data files for long running spark applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal cluster test.","created_at":"2022-09-18T14:25:52Z","updated_at":"2023-02-04T02:37:19Z","closed_at":"2023-01-14T10:24:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d2d5b59add06061f27448fec6deaffb7d810568","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3181e640a4a8154a3b99e404ef89a8673e837af8","head":{"label":"wankunde:remove_shuffle_merge","ref":"remove_shuffle_merge","sha":"3181e640a4a8154a3b99e404ef89a8673e837af8","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260172941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNzI5NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"wankunde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new error sub-class `UNEXPECTED_INPUT_TYPE` of the error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH`, and use it in the default case when a type of an input doesn't match to expression's expected type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMigration onto error classes unifies Spark SQL error messages, and improves search-ability of errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The PR changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate all parsing errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ExpressionParserSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-09-16T09:56:41Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T08:24:56Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T08:24:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eac70badf46c2161409973b34947d872ebc3cbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31194da609e930b964007f34b360c1206d35d630","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:legacy-error-temp","ref":"legacy-error-temp","sha":"31194da609e930b964007f34b360c1206d35d630","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.c

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**The background**\r\nCurrently, Spark `Decimal` use the `java.math.BigDecimal` as the underlying implementation.\r\nAs we know, the computing and storage efficiency of Spark `Decimal`  is very low.\r\nThis PR let `Decimal` can supports other underlying implementation.\r\n\r\n**The design**\r\nThe refactoring design of Spark `Decimal` is mainly based on the proxy mode - that is, to create the abstraction class `DecimalOperation`, to lower the current implementation of Spark `Decimal` based on `java.math.BigDecimal` to `JDKDecimalOperation`. The API of Spark `Decimal` remains unchanged and proxies the corresponding interface methods of `DecimalOperation`. The whole design is shown in the figure below.\r\n![UML 图](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/190606990-19252d1b-8f9f-49e1-8244-408b02e77e73.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhether Spark `Decimal` will proxy `JDKDecimalOperation` or other subclasses of `DecimalOperation` depends on the configuration parameter `spark.sql.decimal.implementation`. The default value of `spark.sql.decimal.implementation` is `JDKBigDecimal`, that is, `Decimal` will proxy `JDKDecimalOperation`. `spark.sql.decimal.implementation` can also be set as other possible optimization implementations.\r\n\r\n**Benchmark**\r\nBefore this refactor, the decimal benchmark show below.\r\n```\r\n[info] running (fork) org.apache.spark.sql.DecimalBenchmark \r\n[info] Running

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes an issue when depending on the name of the `_corrupt_record` field, column pruning would behave differently for a record that has no parsing errors.\r\n\r\nFor example, with a CSV file like this (c1 and c2 columns):\r\n```\r\n1,a\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, the following query would return:\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read\r\n  .schema(\"c1 int, c2 string, x string, _corrupt_record string\")\r\n  .csv(\"file:/tmp/file.csv\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"x\", lit(\"A\"))\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n+---+---+---+---------------+\r\n|c1 |c2 |x  |_corrupt_record|\r\n+---+---+---+---------------+\r\n|1  |a  |A  |1,a            |\r\n+---+---+---+---------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you rename the corrupt record column, the result is different (the original, arguably correct, behaviour before https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/959694271e30879c944d7fd5de2740571012460a):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read \r\n  .option(\"columnNameCorruptRecord\", \"corrupt_record\")\r\n  .schema(\"c1 int, c2 string, x string, corrupt_record string\") \r\n  .csv(\"file:/tmp/file.csv\") .withColumn(\"x\", lit(\"A\")) \r\n\r\n+---+---+---+--------------+\r\n|c1 |c2 |x  |corrupt_record|\r\n+---+---+---+--------------+\r\n|1  |a  |A  |null          |\r\n+---+---+---+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the former so both results would return `null` for corrupt record as there are no parsing issues. Note that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38523 is still fixed and works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug where corrupt record would be non-null even though the record has no parsing errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixes the output of corrupt record with additional columns provided by user. Everything should be unchanged outside of that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test that reproduces the issue.","created_at":"2022-09-16T05:20:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T23:00:34Z","closed_at":"2022-09-17T08:00:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f373825d02c9bff55e9883ebe7e906e2da74e43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a67961ce8d643b0db171947c410d176a5047a26a","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-40468","ref":"SPARK-40468","sha":"a67961ce8d643b0db171947c410d176a5047a26a","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to split the FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite into three pieces:\r\n\r\n1. GroupStateSuite <- test the functionality with (Test)GroupState implementation\r\n2. FlatMapGroupsWithStateWithInitialStateSuite <- test E2E cases which are specific to initial state\r\n3. FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite <- all other cases (E2E cases which don't leverage initial state)\r\n\r\nThe change is pure extraction - it's cut and paste and no additional code change has been introduced.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis would help to maintain the test suite FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite as it's quite huge.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRefactored test suites.","created_at":"2022-09-16T03:21:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T09:42:21Z","closed_at":"2022-09-16T09:42:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dbb8af41ed7444567d1a69b51fb01b34ba81402d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

So, [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/ProgressReporter.scala#L348) we cannot find the plan and collect metrics correctly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by replacing the initial `LogicalPlan` with the `LogicalPlan` containing the metadata column\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + New

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAbort result stage directly when it failed caused by FetchFailedException.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHere's a very serious bug：\r\n`The resultStage with indeterminate parent mapStage resubmit and it led to data inconsistency problems.`\r\n\r\nAnd The reasons for data inconsistency are as follows：\r\nWhen result stage failed caused by `FetchFailedException`,  spark will determine whether it can be retried.\r\nAnd the original condition is `numMissingPartitions < resultStage.numTasks`. It is not an exact condition.\r\n\r\nIf this condition holds on retry, at this time some other running tasks at the current failed result stage might not have been killed yet, when result stage was resubmit, it would got wrong partitions to recalculation.\r\n```\r\n// DAGScheduler#submitMissingTasks\r\n \r\n// Figure out the indexes of partition ids to compute.\r\nval partitionsToCompute:

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21790 because it's no longer needed. It kept the original error from Hive when Spark loads builtin functions from Hive, which no longer happens as Spark has implemented all builtin functions natively.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the test suites for #37893, applyInPandasWithState. The new test suite mostly ports E2E test cases from existing [flatMapGroupsWithState](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite.scala).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTests are missing in #37893 by intention to reduce the size of change, and this PR fills the gap.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suites.","created_at":"2022-09-15T04:22:56Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T06:37:25Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T06:37:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd941c84e7f94376b877996c8047de449bb41b86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce the new API `applyInPandasWithState` in PySpark, which provides the functionality to perform arbitrary stateful processing in Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\nThis will be a pair API with applyInPandas - applyInPandas in PySpark covers the use case of flatMapGroups in Scala/Java API, applyInPandasWithState in PySpark covers the use case of flatMapGroupsWithState in Scala/Java API.\r\n\r\nThe signature of API follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# call this function after groupBy\r\ndef applyInPandasWithState(\r\n    self,\r\n    func: \"PandasGroupedMapFunctionWithState\",\r\n    outputStructType: Union[StructType, str],\r\n    stateStructType: Union[StructType, str],\r\n    outputMode: str,\r\n    timeoutConf: str,\r\n) -> DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the signature of user function follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef func(\r\n    key: Tuple,\r\n    pdf_iter: Iterator[pandas.DataFrame],\r\n    state: GroupStateImpl\r\n) -> Iterator[pandas.DataFrame]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Please refer the code diff for function doc of new function.)\r\n\r\nMajor design choices which differ from existing APIs:\r\n\r\n1. The new API is untyped, while flatMapGroupsWithState in typed API.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the nature of Python language - it's really duck typing and type definition is just a hint. We don't have the implementation of typed API for PySpark DataFrame.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to design the API to be untyped, meaning, all types for (input, state, output) should be Row-compatible. While we don't require end users to deal with `Row` directly, the model they will use for state and output must be convertible to Row with default encoder. If they want the python type for state which is not compatible with Row (e.g. custom class), they need to pickle and use BinaryType to store it.\r\n\r\nThis requires end users to specify the type of state and output via Spark SQL schema in the method.\r\n\r\nNote that this helps to ensure compatibility for state data across Spark versions, as long as the encoders for 1) python type -> python Row and 2) python Row -> UnsafeRow are not changed. We won't change the underlying data layout for UnsafeRow, as it will break all of existing stateful query.\r\n\r\n2. The new API will produce Pandas DataFrame to user function, while flatMapGroupsWithState produces iterator of rows.\r\n \r\nWe decided to follow the user experience applyInPandas provides for both consistency and performance (Arrow batching, vectorization, etc). This leads us to design the user function to leverage pandas DataFrame rather than iterator of rows. While this leads inconsistency of the UX from the Scala/Java API, we don't think this will come up as a problem since Pandas is considered as de-facto standard for Python data scientists.\r\n\r\n3. The new API will produce iterator of Pandas DataFrame to user function and also require to return iterator of Pandas DataFrame to address scalability.\r\n\r\nThere is known limitation of applyInPandas, scalability. It basically requires data in a specific group to be fit into memory. During the design phase of new API, we decided to address the scalability rather than inheriting the limitation.\r\n\r\nTo address the scalability, we tweak the user function to receive an iterator (generator) of Pandas DataFrame instead of a single Pandas DataFrame, and also return an iterator (generator) of Pandas DataFrame. We think it does not hurt the UX too much, as for-each and yield would be enough to deal with the requirement of dealing with iterator.\r\n\r\nImplementation perspective, we split the data in a specific group to multiple chunks, which each chunk is stored and sent as \"an\" Arrow RecordBatch, and then finally materialized to \"a\" pandas DataFrame. This way, as long as end users don't materialize lots of pandas DataFrames from the iterator at the same time, only one chunk will be materialized into memory which is scalable. Similar logic applies to the output of user function, hence scalable as well.\r\n\r\n4. The new API also bin-packs the data with multiple groups into \"an\" Arrow RecordBatch.\r\n\r\nGiven the API is mainly used for streaming workload, it could be high likely that the volume of data in a specific group may not be huge enough to leverage the benefit of Arrow columnar batching, which would hurt the performance. To address this, we also do the opposite thing what we do for scalability, bin-pack. That said, an Arrow RecordBatch can contain data for multiple groups, as well as a part of data for specific group. This address both aspects of concerns together, scalability and performance.\r\n\r\nNote that we are not implementing all of features Scala/Java API provide from the initial phase. e.g. Support for batch query and support for initial state will be left as TODO.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPySpark users don't have a way to perform arbitrary stateful processing in Structured Streaming and being forced to use either Java or Scala which is unacceptable for users in many cases. This PR enables PySpark users to deal with it without moving to Java/Scala world.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. We are exposing new public API in PySpark which performs arbitrary stateful processing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A. We will make sure test suites are constructed via E2E manner under [SPARK-40431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40431) - #37894

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the following error classes:\r\n\r\n- PARTITIONS_ALREADY_EXIST\r\n  Cannot ADD or RENAME TO partition(s) <partitionList> in table <tableName> because they already exist.\r\n  Choose a different name, drop the existing partition, or add the IF NOT EXISTS clause to tolerate a pre-existing partition\r\n\r\n- PARTITIONS_NOT_FOUND\r\n  The partition(s) <partitionList> cannot be found in table <tableName>.\r\n  Verify the partition specification and table name.\r\n  To tolerate the error on drop use ALTER TABLE … DROP IF EXISTS PARTITION.\r\n\r\n-  ROUTINE_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n  Cannot create the function <routineName> because it already exists.\r\n  Choose a different name, drop or replace the existing function, or add the IF NOT EXISTS clause to tolerate a pre-existing function\r\n\r\n- ROUTINE_NOT_FOUND\r\n  The function <routineName> cannot be found. Verify the spelling and correctness of the schema and catalog.\r\n  If you did not qualify the name with a schema and catalog, verify the current_schema() output, or qualify the name with the correct schema and catalog.\r\n  To tolerate the error on drop use DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS\r\n\r\n- SCHEMA_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n  Cannot create schema <schemaName> because it already exists.\r\n  Choose a different name, drop the existing schema, or add the IF NOT EXISTS clause to tolerate pre-existing schema\r\n\r\n- SCHEMA_NOT_EMPTY\r\n  Cannot drop a schema <schemaName> because it contains objects.\r\n  Use DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE to drop the schema and all its objects.\r\n\r\n- SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND\r\n  The schema <schemaName> cannot be found. Verify the spelling and correctness of the schema and catalog.\r\n  If you did not qualify the name with a catalog, verify the current_schema() output, or qualify the name with the correct catalog.\r\n  To tolerate the error on drop use DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS.\r\n\r\n- TABLE_OR_VIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n  Cannot create table or view <relationName> because it already exists.\r\n  Choose a different name, drop or replace the existing object, or add the IF NOT EXISTS clause to tolerate pre-existing objects\r\n\r\n- TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND\r\n  The table or view <relationName> cannot be found. Verify the spelling and correctness of the schema and catalog.\r\n  If you did not qualify the name with a schema, verify the current_schema() output, or qualify the name with the correct schema and catalog.\r\n  To tolerate the error on drop use DROP VIEW IF EXISTS or DROP TABLE IF EXISTS.\r\n \r\n- TEMP_TABLE_OR_VIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n  Cannot create the temporary view <relationName> because it already exists.\r\n  Choose a different name, drop or replace the existing view,  or add the IF NOT EXISTS clause to tolerate pre-existing views.\r\n  \r\nAlso (for JDBC data sources):\r\n\r\n- INDEX_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n  Cannot create the index because it already exists. <message>.\r\n \r\n- INDEX_NOT_FOUND\r\n  Cannot find the index. <message>.\r\n\r\nSome background:\r\n* We use ROUTINE over FUNCTION to be future proof, if/when PROCEDUREs appear.\r\n* We coarsify around TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND and TABLE_OR_VIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS (getting rid of dedicated reason as RENAME TABLE, etc.\r\n* We combine PARTITION and PARTITIONS errors\r\n* I use SCHEMA religiously. A debate can be had whether/ho/when to return NAMESPACE  \r\n\r\nThere is currently one failure caused by:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40521\r\nHive based ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION returns to many partitions in case of PARTITIONS_ALREADY_EXISTS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to convert all error to use the error-class framework\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, we are moving away from \"free txt\" and consolidate errors is error-classes.json.\r\nThis hardens the QA and code allowing us to improve error

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in Parquet V1 read path, Spark will pushdown data filters even if they have no reference in the Parquet read schema. This can cause correctness issues as described in [SPARK-39833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39833).\r\n\r\nThe root cause, it seems, is because in the V1 path, we first use `AttributeReference` equality to filter out data columns without partition columns, and then use `AttributeSet` equality to filter out filters with only references to data columns.\r\nThere's inconsistency in the two steps, when case sensitive check is false.\r\n\r\nTake the following scenario as example:\r\n- data column: `[COL, a]`\r\n- partition column: `[col]`\r\n- filter: `col > 10`\r\n\r\nWith `AttributeReference` equality, `COL` is not considered equal to `col` (because their names are different), and thus the filtered out data column set is still `[COL, a]`. However, when calculating filters with only reference to data columns, `COL` is **considered equal** to `col`. Consequently, the filter `col > 10`, when checking with `[COL, a]`, is considered to have reference to data columns, and thus will be pushed down to Parquet as data filter.\r\n\r\nOn the Parquet side, since `col` doesn't exist in the file schema (it only has `COL`), when column index enabled, it will incorrectly return wrong number of rows. See [PARQUET-2170](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-2170) for more detail.\r\n\r\nIn general, where data columns overlap with partition columns and case sensitivity is false, partition filters will not be filter out before we calculate filters with only reference to data columns, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes the correctness bug described in [SPARK-39833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39833).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are existing test cases for this issue from [SPARK-39833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39833). This also modified them to test the scenarios when case sensitivity is on or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes the authentication failure of the proxy user on driver side while accessing kerberized hdfs through spark on k8s job. It follows the similar approach as it was done for Mesos: https://github.com/mesosphere/spark/pull/26\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen we try to access the kerberized HDFS through a proxy user in Spark Job running in cluster deploy mode with Kubernetes resource manager, we encounter AccessControlException. This is because  authentication in driver is done using tokens of the proxy user and since proxy user doesn't have any delegation tokens on driver, auth fails.\r\n\r\nFurther details:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25355?focusedCommentId=17532063&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17532063\r\n\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25355?focusedCommentId=17532135&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17532135\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user will now be able to use proxy-user to access kerberized hdfs with Spark on K8s.\r\n\r\n \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch was tested by:\r\n\r\n1. Running job which accesses kerberized hdfs with proxy user in cluster mode and client mode with kubernetes resource manager.\r\n\r\n2. Running job which accesses kerberized hdfs without proxy user in cluster mode and client mode with kubernetes resource manager.\r\n\r\n3.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates `DropTable`/`DropView` to use `UnresolvedIdentifier` instead of `UnresolvedTableOrView`/`UnresolvedView`. This has several benefits:\r\n1. Simplify the `ifExits` handling. No need to handle `DropTable` in `ResolveCommandsWithIfExists` anymore.\r\n2. Avoid one table lookup if we eventually fallback to v1 command (v1 `DropTableCommand` will look up table again)\r\n3. v2 catalogs can avoid table lookup entirely if possible.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves table uncaching to match by table name directly, so that we don't need to look up the table and resolve to table relations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSave table lookup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add explicit Yunikorn queue submission test coverage instead of implicit assignment by admission controller.\r\n\r\n### Why are

edit the rule explicitly). This breaks Apache Spark's default scheduler K8s IT test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually run the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes new algorithm to create &  store the constraints.\r\nIt tracks aliases in projection which eliminates the need of pessimistically generating all the permutations of a given constraint. It is also more effective in correctly identifying the filters which can be pruned , apart from minimizing the memory used as compared to the current code. This also has changes to push compound filters if the join condition is on multiple attributes and the constraint comprises of more than 1 attributes of the join conditions.\r\n\r\nPresently I have kept the code which retains the old logic of constraint management along with the new logic. It is controlled by the sql conf property **spark.sql.optimizer.optimizedConstraintPropagation.enabled** which is by default true. Once the PR is approved it would make sense to remove the old code & merge the code of ConstraintSet into ExpressionSet and removing some if else blocks in the Optimizer & the function Optimizer.getAllConstraints and LogicalPlan.getAllValidConstraints.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new logic is as follows:\r\nIn the class ConstraintSet which extends ExpressionSet, we track the aliases , along with the base constraint.\r\nAny constraint which is added to the ConstraintSet is stored in the most canonicalized form (i.e consisting of only those attributes which are part of the output set and NOT the Alias's attribute).\r\n\r\nfor eg consider a hypothetical plan\r\n\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\nAt the node Filter the constraint set will just have constraint a + b > 10\r\nAt the Node Projection1 , the constraint set will have\r\nconstraint a + b > 10\r\nand maintain following buffers\r\nbuff1 -> a , a1.attribute, a2. attribute\r\nbuff2 -> b, b1.attribute, b2.attribute\r\nbuff3 -> a + b, z.attribute\r\n\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 is already canonicalized in terms of output attributes.\r\n\r\nNow there are two filters on top of projection1\r\nFilter( z > 10) and Filter ( a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n\r\nTo prune the above two filters, we canonicalize z as a + b ( from the data maintained in the ConstraintSet) & check if the underlying set contains a +b > 10 & so can be pruned.\r\nFor Filter a1 + b2 > 10, we identify the buffer to which a1 & b2 belong to and replace it with 0th elements of the buffer, which will yield a +b > 10, and so filter can be pruned.\r\n\r\nNow suppose there is another Project2 ( a1, a2, b1, b2, z, c)\r\ni.e say attributes a & b are no longer part of OutputSet.\r\n\r\nsuch that the plan looks like:\r\n>         Projection2 ( a1,  a2,  b1,  b2, c,  z)\r\n                                |\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\n**The idea is that \"as much as possible try to make a constraint survive.**\r\n\r\nSo in Project2 , the atttributes a & b are being eliminated.\r\nwe have a constraint a + b > 10 which is dependent on it.\r\nso in the ConstraintSet of the ProjectP2, we update it such that\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 becomes ----> a1 + b1 > 10\r\n**buff1   ->  a , a1, a2   will become --> a1, a2\r\nbuff2  ->  b , b1, b2.  will become  --> b1, b2\r\nbuff3   ->  a +b , z  will become  -->. a1 + b1 , z**\r\n\r\nThis way by tracking aliases & just storing the canonicalized base constraints we can eliminate the need of pessimistically generating all combination of constraints.\r\n\r\n**This PR also eliminates the need of EqualNullSafe constraints for the alias.\r\nIt also is able to handle the literal boolean constraints.**\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new Filter from constraints**_\r\nwe use following logic\r\nNew Filter = Filter.constraints -- ( Filter.child.constraints ++ Filter.constraints.convertToCanonicalizedIfRequired(Filter.conditions) )\r\nSo the idea is that new filter conditions without redundancy can be obtained by difference of current node's constraints & the child node's constraints & the condition itself properly canonicalized in terms of base attributes which will be part of the output set of filter node.\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new filters for Join push down,**_\r\n we identify all the equality conditions & then the attributes are segregated on the lines of LHS & RHS of joins. So to identify filters for push down on RHS side, we get all equality atttributes of LHS side & ask the ConstraintSet to return all the constraints which are subset of the passed LHS attributes. The LHS attributes are appropriately canonicalized & the ConstraintSet identified.\r\nOnce the constraints are know, we can replace the attributes with the corresponding RHS attributes. This helps in identifying the compound filters for push down & not just single attribute filters.\r\n\r\n_**Below is a description of the changes proposed.**_\r\n\r\nConstraintSet: This is the class which does the tracking of the aliases , stores the constraints in the canonicalized form, updates the constraints using available aliases if any of the attribute comprising constraint is getting eliminated. The contains method of this class is used for filter pruning. It also identifies those constraints which can generated new filters for push down in join nodes.\r\nRest all the changes are just to integrate the new logic as well as retain the old constraints logic.\r\nPls notice that related to tpcds plan stability , I had to add new golden files for q75. The change as such is trivial.\r\npreviously pushed filter was generated as\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_order_number), IsNotNull(cr_item_sk)]\r\nand with the change it is\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_item_sk), IsNotNull(cr_order_number)]\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. This issue if not fixed can cause OutOfMemory issue or unacceptable query compilation times.\r\nAdded a test **\"plan equivalence with case statements and performance comparison with benefit of more than 10x conservatively\"  in  org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite**. With this PR the compilation _**time is 247 ms vs 13958 ms without the change**_\r\n2. It is more effective in filter pruning as is evident in some of the tests in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite where current code is not able to identify the redundant filter in some cases.\r\n3. It is able to generate a better optimized plan for join queries as it can push compound predicates.\r\n4. The current logic can miss a lot of possible cases of removing redundant predicates, as it fails to take into account if same attribute or its aliases are repeated multiple times in a complex expression.\r\n5. There are cases where some of the optimizer rules involving removal of redundant predicates fail to remove on the basis of constraint data. In some cases the rule works, just by the virtue of previous rules helping it out to cover the inaccuracy. That the ConstraintPropagation rule & its function of removal of redundant filters & addition of new inferred filters is dependent on the working of some of the other unrelated previous optimizer rules is behaving, is indicative of issues.\r\n6. It does away with all the EqualNullSafe constraints as this logic does not need those constraints to be created.\r\n7.  There is atleast one test in existing **ConstraintPropagationSuite** which is missing a IsNotNull constraints because the code incorrectly generated a EqualsNullSafeConstraint instead of EqualTo constraint, when using the existing Constraints code.  With these changes, the test correctly creates an EqualTo constraint, resulting in an inferred IsNotNull constraint\r\n8. It does away with the current combinatorial  logic of evaluation all the constraints can cause compilation to run into hours or cause OOM. The number of constraints stored is exactly the same as the number of filters encountered\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded a test suite **CompareNewAndOldConstraintsSuite** which when run on current master, will fail highlighting the issues with current master ( in terms of functionality) and also show the perf problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMany new tests are added. All existing tests are passing cleanly.\r\nCode is functional in workday env. for 1.5 years  without any issue\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-13T16:39:41Z","updated_at":"2023-01-02T00:19:09Z","closed_at":"2023-01-02T00:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0dcea616a3606303809d1b84cea1ad54642272e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c95ff4cd3526cba33187e25eb5db8afd8fcaf94e","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-33152","ref":"SPARK-33152","sha":"c95ff4cd3526cba33187e25eb5db8afd8fcaf94e","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are two places in Spark that depend on okio\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] +- org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:jar:3.141.59:test\r\n...\r\n[INFO] |

`Spark Project Assembly` chose `com.squareup.okio:okio:jar:1.14.0` instead of `com.squareup.okio:okio:jar:1.15.0` as compile scope dependency\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] +-

|  \\- com.squareup.okio:okio:jar:1.14.0:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the okio version in spark-deps file is also 1.14.0, this seems to be an incorrect behavior, so this pr explicitly adds the dependency definition of `com.squareup.okio:okio` to clarify that the 1.15.0 used by `kubernetes-client` is the compile scope dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nShould use okio 1.15.0 in spark-deps files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange canonicalization to a one pass process and move logic from `Canonicalize.reorderCommutativeOperators` to the respective commutative operators' `canonicalize`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34883 improved expression canonicalization performance but introduced regression when a commutative operator is under a `BinaryComparison`. This is because children reorder by their hashcode can't happen in `preCanonicalized` phase when children are not yet \"final\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change PythonArrowInput and PythonArrowOutput to be more generic to cover the complex data type on both input and output. This is a baseline work for #37863.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe traits PythonArrowInput and PythonArrowOutput can be further generalized to cover complex data type on both input and output. E.g. Not all operators would have simple InternalRow as input data to pass to Python worker and vice versa for output data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-09-13T13:10:41Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T05:18:07Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T05:18:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffa9379574fd92f2efde7b627ad4cbcfd14a9a3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/beecc9e66fab4ffeda2f64381297e502532bc0d8","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-40414","ref":"SPARK-40414","sha":"beecc9e66fab4ffeda2f64381297e502532bc0d8","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to factor the common attributes out from `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec` to `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExecBase`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of stuff to share if you implement another version of `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec`.\r\nShould better factor them out. This is also part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37285 which demonstrates how the refactored trait is used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is refactoring-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases should cover

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when calling the method `checkError` from `SparkFunSuite` to check the QueryContext, we need to include the trait `QueryErrorsSuiteBase` to use ExpectedContext. \r\nThis is not convenient. Let's simply migrate the trait `QueryErrorsSuiteBase` into `SparkFunSuite`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify test framework\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nGA","created_at":"2022-09-12T21:06:35Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T02:49:29Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T01:55:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d2f27a055d499f8b7056ea8dea196559616655f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0bc75268c2df18310f0b81e8f98f34034297c6ce","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:minorRefactor","ref":"minorRefactor","sha":"0bc75268c2df18310f0b81e8f98f34034297c6ce","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the error class `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` from `error-classes.json` and the exception `SparkIndexOutOfBoundsException`. And replace the last one by a SparkException w/ the error class `INTERNAL_ERROR` because the exception should not be raised in regular cases.\r\n\r\n`ArrayDataIndexedSeq` throws the exception from `apply()`, and `ArrayDataIndexedSeq` can be created from `ArrayData.toSeq` only. The last one is invoked from 2 places:\r\n\r\n1. The `Slice` expression ( or `slice` function):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/443eea97578c41870c343cdb88cf69bfdf27033a/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L1600-L1601\r\n\r\nwhere any access to the produced array is guarded:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nspark.sql.ansi.enabled\ttrue\r\nTime taken: 2.415 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> SELECT slice(array(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)[4];\r\n...\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: [INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX] The index 4 is out of bounds. The array has 2 elements. Use the SQL function `get()` to tolerate accessing element at invalid index and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nSELECT slice(array(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)[4]\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for SPARK-40107. It updates the way we check the `empty2null` expression in a V1 write query plan. Previously, we only search for this expression in Project. But optimizer can change the position of this expression, for example collapsing projects with aggregates. As a result, we need to search the entire plan to see if `empty2null` has been added by `V1Writes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo prevent unnecessary `empty2null` projections from being added in FileFormatWriter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2022-09-12T14:32:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T04:08:35Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T04:08:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89945882597f8a575394d6ff42b381008149c1c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29617482e5827015c90b7ec7e7916e3b01d17460","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-40107-followup","ref":"spark-40107-followup","sha":"29617482e5827015c90b7ec7e7916e3b01d17460","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 100, 1, 50).repartition(4)\r\nval v = df.rdd.mapPartitions { iter => {\r\n        Iterator.single(iter.length)\r\n}.collect()\r\nprintln(v.mkString(\",\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above simple code outputs `50,0,0,50`, which means there is no data in partition 1 and partition 2.\r\n\r\nThe RoundRobin seems to ensure to distribute the records evenly *in the same partition*, and not guarantee it between partitions.\r\n\r\nBelow is the code to generate the key\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n      case RoundRobinPartitioning(numPartitions) =>\r\n        // Distributes elements evenly across output partitions, starting from a random partition.\r\n        var position = new Random(TaskContext.get().partitionId()).nextInt(numPartitions)  \r\n        (row: InternalRow) =>\r\n{         // The HashPartitioner will handle the `mod` by the number of partitions  \r\n         position += 1        \r\n         position        \r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, There are 50 partitions, each partition will only compute 2 elements. The issue for RoundRobin here is it always starts with position=2 to do the Roundrobin.\r\n\r\nSee the output of Random\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> (1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(4) + \" \"))  // the position is always 2.\r\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the below Random code also outputs the same value, \r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n(1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(2) + \" \"))\r\n(1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(4) + \" \"))\r\n(1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(8) + \" \"))\r\n(1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(16) + \" \"))\r\n(1 to 200).foreach(partitionId => print(new Random(partitionId).nextInt(32) + \" \"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider partition 0, the total elements are [0, 1], so when shuffle writes, for element 0, the key will be (position + 1) = 2 + 1 = 3%4=3, the element 1, the key will be (position + 1)=(3+1)=4%4 = 0\r\nconsider partition 1, the total elements are [2, 3], so when shuffle writes, for element 2, the key will be (position + 1) = 2 + 1 = 3%4=3, the element 3, the key will be (position + 1)=(3+1)=4%4 = 0\r\n \r\n\r\nThe calculation is also applied for other left partitions since the starting position is always 2 for this case.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, each partition will write its elements to Partition [0, 3], which results in Partition [1, 2] without any data.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the starting position of RoundRobin. The default position calculated by `new Random(partitionId).nextInt(numPartitions)` may always be the same for different partitions, which means each partition will output the data into the same keys when shuffle writes, and some keys may not have any data in some special cases.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `UnsafeArrayWriter#initialize` to use longs rather than ints when calculating the initial size of the array.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen calculating the initial size in bytes needed for the array, `UnsafeArrayWriter#initialize` uses an int expression, which can overflow. The initialize method then passes the negative size to `BufferHolder#grow`, which complains about the negative size.\r\n\r\nExample (the following will run just fine on a 16GB laptop, despite the large driver size setting):\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-sql --driver-memory 22g --master \"local[1]\"\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view data1 as\r\nselect 0 as key, id as val\r\nfrom range(0, 268271216);\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view data2 as\r\nselect key as lkey, collect_list(val) as bigarray\r\nfrom data1\r\ngroup by key;\r\n\r\n-- the below cache forces Spark to create unsafe rows\r\ncache lazy table data2;\r\n\r\nselect count(*) from data2;\r\n```\r\nAfter a few minutes, `BufferHolder#grow` will throw the following exception:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot grow BufferHolder by size -2115263656 because the size is negative\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BufferHolder.grow(BufferHolder.java:67)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeArrayWriter.initialize(UnsafeArrayWriter.java:61)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Collect.serialize(collect.scala:73)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Collect.serialize(collect.scala:37)\r\n```\r\nThis query was going to fail anyway, but the message makes it looks like a bug in Spark rather than a user problem. `UnsafeArrayWriter#initialize` should calculate using a long expression and fail if the size exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, showing the actual initial size in the error message.\r\n\r\nNote: This issue is not related to SPARK-39608, as far as I can tell, despite having the same symptom\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOther than a better error message, no.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-12T00:51:49Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T00:27:31Z","closed_at":"2022-09-14T02:46:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3410de095832d0638773f34c9de834a207a76bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21aebe06205e455738c3e2372d0a0da1dc9abc62","head":{"label":"bersprockets:bufferholder_message_issue","ref":"bufferholder_message_issue","sha":"21aebe06205e455738c3e2372d0a0da1dc9abc62","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange canonicalization to a one pass process and move logic from `Canonicalize.reorderCommutativeOperators` to the respective commutative operators' `canonicalize`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34883 improved expression canonicalization performance but introduced regression when a commutative operator is under a `BinaryComparison`. This is because children reorder by their hashcode can't happen in `preCanonicalized` phase when children are not yet \"final\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new
