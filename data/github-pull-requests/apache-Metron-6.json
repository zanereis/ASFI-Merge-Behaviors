When the field is `metron`, then it should go into the `1642_second` index and a new field `new_field` should be created.  Otherwise, it will go in as-is in the `1642_pre` index.\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1641\r\n\r\nThis enables Pcap Jobs to be run asynchronously. The PcapJob class itself is now a Statusable implementation that allows clients to poll for current JobStatus. This implementation exposes the new functionality on the job class but keeps the existing PcapCli functionality intact and unchanged. The tests for this will be in a comment below, taken from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/256.\r\n\r\nThis validation should check that the current pcap functionality does not break. Follow on PR's will leverage the new asynchronous capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of the Alerts UI by applying alert status updates optimistically.  The approach is similar to the change in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1077.  I also changed the process of renaming a metaalert to be optimistic as well since it follows the same pattern.  I'm happy to split that off into a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Refactored the getData method by moving logic to update an alert to it's own method.\r\n- Removed the toggleAlertEditor parameter from the getData function.  This should be called separately in my opinion.\r\n- Moved redundant code to a single updateAlertState function\r\n- Updated the alert update process to immediately apply the update to the UI and revert to the previous state when an update fails.\r\n- Updated the metaalert name update process to immediately apply the update to the UI and revert to the previous state when an update fails.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. Navigate to the Alerts UI and open the details panel for an alert.  Changing the status of an alert should be reflected in the UI immediately.  To test the case of an error being returned from the back end, I stopped the REST application and then tried to change the alert status.  You should see the alert status change for no more than a split second before reverting to the previous state.  The name change fix can also be tested this way by creating a metaalert and changing the name. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n[As described in this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1631), the dash score in the tree view wouldn't have a value if only one Group By button was selected. This was caused by logic in the tree view executing before the required data was returned by the global configuration service. For a quick and simple solution, I removed the service subscription and instead chose to pass the global configuration as an `@Input` since the parent component is already fetching that data with its own service subscription on app load. I also removed `getGroupRequest()` from the tree view selector 's `*ngIf` logic because the parent component already fetches that information too.\r\n\r\nWhile doing this work, I noticed that there are several repetitive subscriptions for data. In the future, we may want to switch to injecting these services in the app module or using a store solution like ngrx so they can be singletons.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR changes the way updates to alert comments work in the Alerts UI.  Previously when adding/removing a comment, the latest version of an alert is retrieved after a 200 status code is received.  However there is latency involved when updating an alert so it's possible the old version is still displayed.\r\n\r\nThis PR treats updates to alert comments optimistically.  The change is applied immediately in the UI and reverted only if an error is returned on update.  A lookup of the alert is no longer needed.  \r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n- adding logic to immediately add a comment in the client side code\r\n- a slight refactor of the setComments function to make it more flexible\r\n- adding an error callback property to the patchAlert function\r\n- implementing error callback functions for adding/removing comments to revert to previous state\r\n\r\nIn both cases of adding/removing comments, reverting state follows the pattern of copying the previous list of comments and falling back to the copy on failure.  I used the `slice` method to do this.  Would be interested to hear if this is the right approach for copying arrays.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Navigate to the Alerts UI and open the details panel for an alert.  Select the comments tab and add a comment.  The change should be displayed immediately.  Removing a comment should also be reflected immediately.  To test the case of an error being returned from the back end, I stopped the REST application and then tried to add a comment.  You should see the alert added for no more than a split second before reverting to the previous state.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nPer the discussion [dev discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/1df267d5b192a304bb745221beb7a6edb6b05d25d0e857f4a53f55aa@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E), seems like we're pretty set up on merging the Solr feature branch back to master.  That discussion also has the status of the feature branch\r\n\r\nIn terms of testing, the individual Jiras at [METRON-1416](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1416), have been tested and they should have appropriate test plans attached. Elasticsearch should work the same way as in master.\r\n\r\nIf we need more detail on testing plans, we can go through and compile everything together.\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been added discussing how to set up Solr.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhen a user tries to add an alert to an already existing metaalert, the details panel should show metaalerts to select from with details. Currently, those details do not show. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, click on the checkbox on the right-hand side to select an alert, click on the 'Actions' button dropdown and select 'Add to Alert'. The details panel that opens should have details for all the metaalerts, but if you're testing from the master branch the info is missing.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

introduced a mechanism to control the batch size and timeout when writing records to Kafka by updating the global properties.  \r\n\r\nBoth Enrichment and the Profiler write records back into Kafka.  The user can independently set the batch size and timeout for each of those. Since these are global properties, the user must set these using the CLI.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    \"profiler.writer.batchSize\" : 15,\r\n    \"profiler.writer.batchTimeout\" : 0,\r\n    \"enrichment.writer.batchSize\" : 15,\r\n    \"enrichment.writer.batchTimeout\" : 0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nWith this change, the user can now adjust these values in Ambari.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.  Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI and that the Service Check passes.\r\n\r\n1. Open the REPL and validate the current value of the global property 'threat.triage.score.field'.  The value here, the default value should be `threat:triage:score`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    ...\r\n    [Stellar]>>> globals := CONFIG_GET(\"GLOBAL\")\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"profiler.writer.batchSize\" : \"15\",\r\n      \"profiler.writer.batchTimeout\" : \"0\",\r\n      ...\r\n      \"enrichment.writer.batchSize\" : \"15\",\r\n      \"enrichment.writer.batchTimeout\" : \"0\",\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nWhen a user tries to search for a single alert contained within a metaalert, an empty result set is returned from the API. Upon further inspection, it looks like this is because the query string is not updated to use metron_alert in place of alert.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, create a metaalert in the UI. Then, search for one of the nested alerts by id in the search bar. Instead of seeing the metaalert and its nested alerts returned, an empty result is displayed (see screenshots below).\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-06-19 at 3 18 43 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/41660053-416dbc40-749b-11e8-8cae-1fc6f2bf53dc.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-06-19 at 3 19 09 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/41660038-360dd9b6-749b-11e8-962e-cfda2541d6e5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR merges the latest version of master into the Solr feature branch.  An ES DAO change was involved so there were a couple extra changes needed.  \r\n\r\nThe changes of interest are related to moving the change from ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao.java to ElasticsearchMetaAlertUpdateDao.java (this class does not exist in master) and adding tests to ElasticsearchMetaAlertDaoTest.java.\r\n\r\nI tested this in full dev to verify the PR from master is included and functioning as expected.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR was built on top of #1047 and so includes those commits which will be cleared up once that PR is merged.  The change is almost exactly the same as #1047, except for a different field.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nBased on #1055 and #1062 , the user can specify the name of the field containing the threat triage score in the global configuration. This is used by the Alerts UI.  Currently a user can only change this value using the CLI. This property should be exposed to the user via Ambari. The user should be able to define this property directly in Ambari.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.  Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI and that the Service Check passes.\r\n\r\n1. Open the REPL and validate the current value of the global property 'threat.triage.score.field'.  The value here, the default value should be `threat:triage:score`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    ...\r\n    [Stellar]>>> globals := CONFIG_GET(\"GLOBAL\")\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"threat.triage.score.field\" : \"threat:triage:score\",\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Change the value in Ambari by going to Metron > Configs > REST > Source Type Field Name.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-06-18 at 5 03 45 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/41562545-f3eadd76-731a-11e8-91a3-9abea3b4063b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Restart all affected services.\r\n\r\n1. After the services have been restarted, open the REPL and validate that the value of the global property 'threat.triage.score.field' changed in the global config.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> globals := CONFIG_GET(\"GLOBAL\")\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"threat.triage.score.field\" : \"different:threat:triage:score:field\",\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now, because fields may not exist, users can have an awkward time.  For instance, checking for is_alert, you end up having to preface checks with exists(is_alert).\r\n\r\nFor instance, in one of our [use-cases](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/use-cases/geographic_login_outliers) we use\r\n```\r\n\"is_alert := exists(is_alert) && is_alert\",\r\n\"is_alert := is_alert || (geo_outlier != null && geo_outlier == true)\"\r\n```\r\n instead of :\r\n```\r\n\"is_alert := is_alert || geo_outlier == true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest that we adopt a convention from javascript whereby we assume a field not existing or being null should act as false in boolean expressions.  This will simplify stellar's use and hopefully result in less awkwardness.\r\n\r\nYou can test this via the REPL.  This is what I did, in addition to unit tests:\r\n```\r\n{12:48}[system]~/Documents/workspace/metron/fork/incubator-metron:stellar_falsey ✓ ➭ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.cli.StellarShell\" -pl metron-stellar/stellar-common\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Building stellar-common 0.5.0\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:java (default-cli) @ stellar-common ---\r\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor).\r\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\r\nlog4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nFunctions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{}\r\n[Stellar]>>> is_alert || null\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> NOT(is_alert)\r\ntrue\r\n[Stellar]>>> is_alert\r\n[Stellar]>>> if is_alert then 'alert' else 'not'\r\nnot\r\n[Stellar]>>> if is_alert || true then 'alert' else 'not'\r\nalert\r\n[Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(is_alert, { false : 'blah', true : 'foo' })\r\n[Stellar]>>>\r\n```\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a small bug where alert updates will fail if the metaalerts index hasn't been created yet.  This is because the metaalert DAO layer attempts to lookup any metaalerts that may contain the alert and update them.  The solution presented here catches this case and safely continues with the update.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Navigate to the alerts UI, click on an alert to open the alerts details panel, and change the status.  There should be no errors and the status should be updated successfully.\r\n\r\nI added a couple unit tests to cover this.  I looked at adding an integration tests but currently our setup creates the metaalerts index.  It's probably more trouble than it's worth to create a new (or significantly modify the existing) integration test specifically for this case.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR removes the META_ALERTS_INDEX constant from the Alerts UI.  The backend is now capable of working out the index given a sensor type (https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1050) so this is not needed.  This was tested in full dev (with both ES and Solr selected as the search engine) by creating a metaalert, navigating to the details panel for the metaalert, and verifying status can be changed successfully.  Note that because https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1038 is not in the Solr feature branch yet, you have to set `\"source.type.field\": \"source:type\"` in the global config when testing with ES.\r\n\r\nI found what I think is a bug in the logic in `alert-details.component.ts` that doesn't properly set `isMetaAlert`.  This causes metaalert details to be displayed like alert details.  As far as I can tell this means showing the \"Comments\" tab.  Was this the intention?  Have we just not noticed this bug?  It's easy to make it behave either way, just not sure what the right way is.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCouple things getting fixed related to the download links that came up as a result of a couple things during the release.\r\n\r\n* Correct the https link for the keys (per  https://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution#download-links).  Make sure the links use this correctly.\r\n* Remove MD5.  Per policy, we don't provide MD5.  The release doesn't contain it, so the link was dead.\r\n* Rename SHA to SHA1.  Per policy, we don't provide a plain SHA file.  Rename to SHA1\r\n* Add SHA256.  We have it, might as well provide the link to it.\r\n\r\nSee instructions for testing PR at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Website+PR+Merge\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR has been submitted against the Solr feature branch; not master.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n  When a user deploys Metron with Solr, the Mpack requires that the user populate the Index Settings > Elasticsearch Hosts field to continue, even when deploying a Metron cluster that indexes to Solr and does not use Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n  * The Elasticsearch related properties under the Ambari 'Index settings' tab should only be required if Elasticsearch is chosen as the indexer.\r\n\r\n  * The Solr related properties under the 'Index Settings' tab should only be required if Solr is chosen as the indexer.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n  * Removed the static validation checks for each of the parameters on the 'Index Settings' tab.  Static validation no longer works because validation depends on which Indexer the user has chosen.\r\n\r\n  * Added a function `check_indexing_parameters` that validates the parameters based on the Indexer that has been chosen by the user on the \"Indexing\" tab.\r\n\r\n  * The parameters are checked before any of the following actions:\r\n      * Updating global properties, which occurs when Parsers, Enrichment, Indexing, Profiler, and REST are started/configured in Ambari.\r\n      * Start/Configure indexing\r\n      * Service Check\r\n      * Install Elasticsearch Template\r\n      * Delete Elasticsearch Template\r\n      * Install Kibana Dashboard\r\n\r\n  * When updating the global properties, we only add either Solr or Elasticsearch properties, but not both as before. \r\n\r\n  * It seems logical to move the 'Indexing Settings' parameters to the \"Indexing\"  tab, especially when it on this page where the user selects the Indexer; Elasticsearch or Solr.  I am not sure if there are other implications in doing this, so I did not do that as part of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n  1. Start the development environment.\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the Alerts UI is receiving alerts and that the Ambari 'Service Check' passes.\r\n\r\n  **Missing Elasticsearch parameters should be caught**\r\n\r\n  1. Stop the Metron services in Ambari.\r\n\r\n  1. Using Ambari, delete (define a blank value for) the `metron-env/es_binary_port` parameter in Metron > Index Settings.\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt to start each of the Metron services; Parsers, Enrichment, Indexing, Profiler, and REST.  These should fail with the following error message.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      resource_management.core.exceptions.Fail: Missing required indexing parameters(s): indexer=Elasticsearch, missing=['metron-env/es_binary_port']\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt the Elasticsearch Template Install.  This should fail with the same error message.\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt the Elasticsearch Template Delete.  This should fail with the same error message.\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt the Kibana Dashboard Install.  This should fail with the same error message.\r\n\r\n  **Missing Elasticsearch parameters should not impact Solr**\r\n\r\n  1. Go to Metron > Indexing and change \"Random Access Search Engine\" to \"Solr\".\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt to start the Indexing topology in Ambari.  This should succeed even though we are missing Elasticsearch parameters.\r\n\r\n  **Ensure Elasticsearch parameters are defined in globals**\r\n\r\n   1. Open up the REPL.\r\n\r\n   1. Check for the Elasticsearch parameters in the globals.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_GET(\"GLOBAL\")\r\n      {\r\n        \"es.clustername\" : \"metron\",\r\n        \"es.ip\" : \"node1:9300\",\r\n        \"es.date.format\" : \"yyyy.MM.dd.HH\",\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  **Missing Solr parameters should be caught**\r\n\r\n  1. Stop the Indexing topology in Ambari.\r\n\r\n  1. Using Ambari, delete (define a blank value for) the `metron-env/solr_zookeeper_url` parameter in Metron > Index Settings.\r\n\r\n  1. Attempt to start the Indexing topology in Ambari.  This should fail with the following error message.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      resource_management.core.exceptions.Fail: Missing required indexing parameters(s): indexer=Solr, missing=['metron-env/solr_zookeeper_url']\r\n      ```\r\n      \r\n  **Ensure Solr parameters are defined in globals**\r\n\r\n   1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a configuration to the global config for the `threat.triage.score` field name, similar to what was done in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1010 for `source.type`, minus the UI changes.\r\n\r\nI also opportunistically fixed a bug where the `source.type` field name wasn't being read from the global config.  Normally this would be a separate PR but the fix overlaps with what was done here so I included it.  I also added a constant for the `source.type.field` property.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added constants for `source.type.field` and `threat.triage.field` (would `threat.triage.score.field` be better?)\r\n- Added getter/setter for AccessConfig in the ElasticsearchDao (necessary for testing)\r\n- Refactored the default threat triage field name in ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao to match source type field name pattern\r\n- Added a `getField` method that gets the field name from the global config or returns the default field name if not found\r\n- Added unit and integration tests for both `source.type.field` and `threat.triage.field`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTesting this in full dev requires changing our indexing topology to use fields with '.'s rather than ':'s.  To do that:\r\n\r\n1. Stop the snort sensor with `service sensor-stubs stop snort`\r\n2. Delete the snort ES index with `curl -XDELETE http://node1:9200/snort_index*`\r\n3. Edit the template at `/var/lib/ambari-agent/cache/common-services/METRON/0.5.0/package/files/snort_index.template` by changing `source:type` to `source.type` and `threat:triage:*score` to `threat.triage.*score`\r\n4. Reinstall the template using the \"Elasticsearch Template Install\" in Ambari\r\n5. Update the global config with the new field names:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"es.clustername\": \"metron\",\r\n  \"es.ip\": \"node1:9300\",\r\n  \"es.date.format\": \"yyyy.MM.dd.HH\",\r\n  \"parser.error.topic\": \"indexing\",\r\n  \"update.hbase.table\": \"metron_update\",\r\n  \"update.hbase.cf\": \"t\",\r\n  \"es.client.settings\": {\r\n    \"client.transport.ping_timeout\": \"500s\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"profiler.client.period.duration\": \"15\",\r\n  \"profiler.client.period.duration.units\": \"MINUTES\",\r\n  \"user.settings.hbase.table\": \"user_settings\",\r\n  \"user.settings.hbase.cf\": \"cf\",\r\n  \"bootstrap.servers\": \"node1:6667\",\r\n  \"geo.hdfs.file\": \"/apps/metron/geo/default/GeoLite2-City.mmdb.gz\",\r\n\"source.type.field\":\"source.type\",\r\n\"threat.triage.score.field\":\"threat.triage.score\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n6. Update the snort indexing config to not DEDOT the field names:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"hdfs\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"elasticsearch\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"fieldNameConverter\": \"NOOP\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"solr\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/indexing/config/snort'\r\n```\r\n7. Start the snort sensor again with `service sensor-stubs start snort`\r\n8.  Wait for data to appear in the snort ES index and then perform a search:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"facetFields\":[],\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"snort\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/search'\r\n```\r\n9. Grab a guid from one of the snort search results and create a metaalert:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"1c082f1a-ad3a-4e46-ae1e-828b73c9a016\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/metaalert/create'\r\n```\r\n10. Now find the metaalert from the guid returned in the previous step:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"1ad8be85-3164-4be9-a773-379abb044d0a\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/findOne'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR there were a couple problems.  First the metaalert had the `source:type` field even though we've switched to \"source.type\" in the global config.  Second, the `threat.triage.score` field in the metaalert would be 0 because the wrong threat triage field name is used to get scores from alerts.  With this PR the metalaert should correctly have the `source.type` field and the `threat.triage.score` field should be > 0 (assuming the snort alert has a threat triage score):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"average\": 10,\r\n  \"max\": 10,\r\n  \"threat.triage.score\": 10,\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"sum\": 10,\r\n  \"source.type\": \"metaalert\",\r\n  \"min\": 10,\r\n  \"median\": 10,\r\n  \"alert\": [\r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

{\"bar\",\"two\"}]}`\r\n\r\nTests where added, along with sample data for integration, and a new sample configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1603\r\n\r\nRan some sample from our unit testing infrastructure that pointed out some shortcomings in the Bro schema not revealed by our standard sensor-stub data that's setup by default as a service for demo purposes in full dev. For Bro records that have multi-valued fields (i.e. an array of values), you will see an exception when indexing in Solr if the collection does not explicitly set multiValued=true for that field.\r\n\r\nI modified the Solr schema check integration test data to flex all of the multi-valued fields I found properly.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently we add a nested field called \"alert\" to our ES templates to enable meta alert querying.  This field name is too common and should be something like \"metron_alert\" instead.\r\n\r\nTo test this, spin up full-dev and add a meta alert via the alerts UI.  You should be able to interact with it via the alerts UI as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates run.sh to include a function (changeAnsibleControlPath) that will check for the OS that the run.sh file is run on. It will update the control_path in ansible.cfg accordingly. \r\n\r\nTest1: \r\nTested the changeAnsibleControlPath function on a sample ansible.cfg across multiple operating systems. Checked to see if the control_path changed properly. The attached image shows the results. \r\n![changeansiblecontrolpath-test1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19417355/40891944-42bfbeae-675d-11e8-8176-5ae863673f44.png)\r\n\r\nTest2: \r\nTesting was done on Mac OS High Sierra using Metron 0.5.0-rc2. The run.sh file was updated to include changeAnsibleControlPath().

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1594\r\n\r\nThis covers the work to convert the KafkaWriter from a basic MessageWriter to a BulkMessageWriter in order to address making producer.send() synchronous. This impacts: parsers, enrichment, indexing (error topic output), and profiler. Anything previously using the KafkaWriter as a single-record MessageWriter has been converted over to using it as a BulkMessageWriter.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n\r\n- ParserBolt was lacking Tick Tuples so I've ported over the functionality almost verbatim from the BulkMessageWriterBolt.\r\n- BulkMessageWriterBolt has been generalized. Previously, it was extending ConfiguredIndexingBolt in both enrichments and indexing.\r\n- Configuring batchSize and batchTimeout for the BulkWriterComponent that wraps BulkMessageWriter(s):\r\n  - parsers stays the same, default updated to 15 (unless/until perf testing suggests a different default more suitable)\r\n  - enrichment - pulls from global config: `enrichment.writer.batchSize` and `enrichment.writer.batchTimeout`\r\n  - indexing - stays the same except for the error output to kafka topic, which has been set to batch size 15 by default\r\n  - profiler - Added a ProfilerWriterConfiguration to match the pattern used by other writers. Pulls from global config: `profiler.writer.batchSize` and `profiler.writer.batchTimeout`\r\n\r\nTested in full dev and data flows into the ES indexes. Currently undergoing performance testing to establish a proper baseline batch size that does not result in performance regressions.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a small bug in the metron-rest.sh start script.  Currently the classpath defaults to `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR:${HBASE_HOME}/conf` in the event that the $METRON_REST_CLASSPATH environment variable is not populated initially.  Instead the HBase and Hadoop directories should be added regardless.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  To reproduce the issue, update Ambari > Metron > Advanced > Advanced metron-rest-env > Metron rest additional classpath to any value and restart Metron REST.  The HBase and Hadoop directories will be missing from the metron-rest classpath (view it with `ps -ef | grep metron-rest`).  After this PR, the HBase and Hadoop configuration directories should be present on the classpath whether that property is set in Ambari or not.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR improves the metron-solr create_collection.sh and delete_collection.sh scripts by switching to the Solr REST api instead of the Solr CLI tools.  This removes the requirement that Metron is colocated with a Solr client and makes the scripts easier to use with different versions and distributions.  Now only a zookeeper client is required for retrieving a Solr node address.\r\n\r\nI refactored the Ambari code a little bit to match the rest of our MPack.  The solr_schema_install and \r\nsolr_schema_delete functions were moved from indexing_master.py to indexing_commands.py because specific, low-level functions are generally in the *_commands.py scripts.  If this is confusing, doesn't make sense or makes reviewing this harder I'm happy to move them back.\r\n\r\nI also added Kerberos support to these scripts.  The way I've done it creates a dependency on the HDP Search 3 Mpack but makes configuring Kerberos easy with no configuration required.  I would like to hear what the community thinks about this approach.  If we do decide to make this a dependency I can also remove the Solr zookeeper configuration setting in Ambari.  At that point using Solr is as easy as switching the \"Random Access Search Engine\" setting.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev with Kerberos enabled.  To test this PR, first install HDP Search 3 in full dev (https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_solr-search-installation/content/hdp-search30-install-mpack.html).  Kerberos can also be enabled now if desired.  Then in Ambari set \"Solr Zookeeper Urls\" in the \"Index Settings\" tab to `node1:2181/solr` and change the \"Random Access Search Engine\" setting in the Indexing tab to `Solr`.  Now stop the Metron Indexing component, then start it.  Note that restart does not trigger automatic Solr collection creation, matching how ES template loading works.  If we think adding collection creation on restart is desirable I can make that change.  Collections (bro, snort, metaalert, yaf, error) should now be present in Solr at node1:8983.\r\n\r\nThe scripts can also be tested independently from Ambari.  Just have to set a few environment variables first:\r\n```\r\nexport ZOOKEEPER=node1:2181/solr\r\nexport SECURITY_ENABLED=true  # if Kerberos is enabled\r\n```\r\nThen the scripts should work when executed directly.  For example, to create the bro collection:\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh bro\r\n```\r\nand to delete the bro collection:\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/delete_collection.sh bro\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

launching a third party parser using `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh` in HDP 2.6, Storm 1.1.0 the following exception is thrown.\r\n ```\r\nClassNotFoundException: org.apache.metron.parsers.topology.MergeAndShadeTransformer\r\n```\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Updated `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh` to detect the Storm version.\r\n\r\n* When using third party parsers and running a Storm version <1.1.0, the `MergeAndShadeTransformer` is used as it has been.\r\n\r\n* When using third party parsers with Storm versions >=1.1.0, the new `--jars` argument is used.\r\n\r\n* Updated the third party parsers README as the 'upload to zookeeper' step was out-of-order.  Also, corrected some minor formatting issues in the README.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Launch a development environment.\r\n\r\n* Ensure that the Alerts UI is being populated with alerts.  This confirms that the the default parsers; like Bro and Snort that do not use 3rd party libs can be launched successfully.\r\n\r\n* Follow the example instructions in `metron-platform/metron-parsers/3rdPartyParser.md` to deploy a parser that uses a 3rd party library.  If the parser can be launched and parse messages, then this change is a success.\r\n\r\n* The development environments are based on HDP 2.6 with Storm 1.1.0.  If you want a gold star, spin this up in an environment based on HDP 2.5 and ensure that 3rd party parser can be launched.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAltering the script a bit. Note that you can't just `git clone git clone $REPO \"$WORKDIR/metron-$VERSION\"` while leaving `WORKDIR=\"~/tmp\"` because git clone is always relative to current dir and you'll end up with a new folder named `~`.\r\n\r\nAlso moved `WORKDIR` down to where it's actually used for clarity, since it gets created earlier than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nTo test, run `./validate-jira-for-release --version=0.5.0 --start=tags/apache-metron-0.4.2-release` and ensure that the checkout occurs in `~/tmp/metron-0.5.0`, rather than in current directory.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRefactored `SolrDao` to kill `getZkHost` and made it `getZkHosts` and return a `List`. `getSolrClient` now takes a `List<String>`, and passes it down.\r\n\r\nI also added a `getSolrClient` method that's just blank, and defers to the `getZkHosts` method.  Our calls to `getSolrClient` are generally `solrDao.getSolrClient(solrDao.getZkHosts)`, which seems unnecessary. I did not however, change everything to use that, but I could definitely be persuaded to as part of this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `SolrColumnMetadataDao` now takes a` SolrClient` instead of a Zookeeper host string, to make it consistent with the other DAOs.\r\n\r\nThere's one catch however: I haven't integration tested this, because I'd need multiple Zk nodes and we don't really have a clean way to get it (neither the `SolrComponent` or `ZkComponent` really let you do it).  I'm not sure if we want or need those tests, or if alternatively we want to spin up a multinode environment and manually test, or if we're fine just assuming things line up (given that it's really testing if the underlying method works as expected at this point). There are unit tests agains the methods to ensure splitting is handled properly in the methods.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nStorm community defines storm-kafka-client 1.1.0 to be \"unstable\" and says 1.2.0 to be stabled one, because Storm community resolved 40 issues including critical and blocker from 1.2.0.\r\n\r\nThere're still couple of issues after 1.2.0 so better to sync up the version to the latest, so I suggest Metron to upgrade the version to the latest, 1.2.1.\r\n\r\nThis patch leverages relocation to hide newly added transitive dependencies: Guava, Jackson, Commons Lang, which are widely used and best known to make conflict between different versions. I have another patch which doesn't relocate, so please let me know if Metron community doesn't want to relocate and retain transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where the source type field wasn't being properly set when the setting isn't defined in the global config.  \r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  It can be verified by navigating to the Alerts UI, logging in, and clicking on a search result in the list of results.  A panel on the right should slide out with the alert details populated.  It should also work if the \"source.type.field\" is set in the global config to \"source:type\" for ES and \"source.type\" for Solr.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdding support for comments on Alerts in Solr.  Nested objects are absurdly painful, so this follows the ES expectation of these not needing to be queryable.\r\n\r\nSolr doesn't have a great way to store these as-is, so they're stored as raw JSON, which is converted appropriately to ensure everything sees the same data as in the ES case.\r\n\r\nThe REST API has been adjusted to have add/remove comment calls, rather than just patching (since that won't work in Solr directly). However, index is required to avoid an error for Solr right now as a result of METRON-1585.  Once that is fixed, index will be optional.\r\n\r\nThere are currently a couple bugs that I would love some help with.\r\n\r\n-  ~In ES, when you add a comment, it doesn't immediately show up on the comments list.  It looks like a findOne is fired off, but I assume ES isn't updated yet.  This doesn't appear to happen in Solr.~ Preexisting, related to UI's handling of new comments.\r\n- ~When I hit delete on a comment in the UI (at least in Solr, unsure about ES), the comment is visually removed, but no remove request is fired off. I assume I have something misaligned, but I'm not sure what.~  Appears to be a browser issue, as it hasn't been reproducible and there's no code path difference between ES and Solr in this case.\r\n- ~I patterned the optional index off of findOne, because it handles it a bit specially.  Delightfully, now I have an extra indexString field showing up in both findOne and the add remove comment.  There's some JsonGetter annotation thing I'm probably not using correctly.  This also happens in findOne currently, so it looks like it's probably a matter of getting the right fix and updating this to match.~ Index removed entirely, so this is moot.\r\n\r\nTo test,\r\nThis can be tested both via REST and the UI.  As noted above, at least right now the UI has more instability associated with it.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the indexing topology receives a message containing invalid JSON, the topology will crash.  The topology needs to handle these types of errors and continue processing.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Updated the `BulkWriterComponent` to provide a means for erring out tuples that do not contain valid JSON messages.\r\n\r\n* Updated `BulkMessageWriterBolt` to handle the case where a tuple does not contain a valid JSON message.\r\n\r\n* Updated `BulkMessageWriterBoltTest` to validate that error'd messages are being ack'd and emitted on the correct error stream.  Previously a mock was being used that hid a bug when erring out tuples with the `BulkWriterComponent` that do not contain a valid JSON message.\r\n\r\n* Added a unit test for the case where an invalid message is sent as input to the indexing topology.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that messages are successfully being indexing by running the Service Check and/or validating the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThere are situations where we are not including the expression in the exception. Also, in stellar enrichments, we should include the relevant variable values in the exception to help with diagnosing issues.\r\n\r\nYou can try this out in the REPL as well as a stellar enrichment.  Use a stellar expression which fails (e.g. `num_var / 0` where `num_var` is an integer field).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nA description of the problem:\r\nThis PR is to revert to the previous control_path in ansible.cfg that is compatible with Mac OS (ansible-ssh-%%C). This corrects an issue due to [PR 754](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/754) that was submitted on Sept 2017. \r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the \"Error\" section of the ec2 README.md to include a solution to the error \"percent_expand: unknown key %C\" that may occur with certain Linux distributions. \r\n\r\nTesting was done on Mac OS High Sierra using \"master\" code from 2018-05-23. However the error that was thrown might not be to due to the control_path issue since ambari_* TASKs were succeeding. \r\n\"TASK [python-pip : Install Python's pip Centos ] ...

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a document's index or collection to search results.  Previously when using Solr, the index field would always be null.  An indexSupplier was recently added to the AccessConfig and is now used in the Solr Daos to get the index from a sensor type and populate that field.  \r\n\r\nI had to fix a bug in the IndexingCacheUtil class where the index field was being retrieved directly instead of for a specific writer.  I think this wasn't caught before because sensor types always equal index in the various index configs and this class returns sensor type by default.  I added a unit test for this class that should cover the different cases and verify that this does default to sensor type.\r\n\r\nI also adjusted unit and integration tests to accommodate this change.  Testing in full dev is still pending and I should have that done today.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is dependent on #1025 and should not be merged until that PR is addressed.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Implemented multiple 'views' of the messages fetched from Kafka.  The \"rich\" view contains not only the message value, but Kafka metadata like the topic, partition, offset, key, and timestamp.\r\n\r\n* Updated KAFKA_GET, KAFKA_TAIL, and KAFKA_FIND so that each can optionally return a \"rich\" view of the messages retrieved from Kafka.\r\n\r\n* Updated KAFKA_PUT so that it can optionally returns a \"rich\" view describing the topic, partition, offset, and timestamp of the message that was just put/sent to Kafka.\r\n\r\n* The change is backwards compatible. By default, only the value (the \"simple\" view) is returned, just like before.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nBy default, only the message value is returned.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> KAFKA_GET(\"bro\")\r\n[{\"http\": {\"ts\":1527122184.853329,\"uid\":\"CUrRne3iLIxXavQtci\",\"id.orig_h\":\"192.168.66.1\",\"id.orig_p\":50451,\"id.resp_h\":\"192.168.66.121\",\"id.resp_p\":8080,\"trans_depth\":177,\"method\":\"GET\",\"host\":\"node1\",\"uri\":\"/api/v1/clusters?fields=Clusters/provisioning_state\\u0026_=1484169117876\",\"referrer\":\"http://node1:8080/\",\"user_agent\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.95 Safari/537.36\",\"request_body_len\":0,\"response_body_len\":0,\"tags\":[]}}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTurn on the \"rich\" view.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> %define stellar.kafka.message.view := \"rich\"\r\nrich\r\n```\r\n\r\nFetch the next message.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> KAFKA_GET(\"bro\")\r\n[{partition=0, offset=2101, topic=bro, value={\"http\": {\"ts\":1527122184.674819,\"uid\":\"CUrRne3iLIxXavQtci\",\"id.orig_h\":\"192.168.66.1\",\"id.orig_p\":50451,\"id.resp_h\":\"192.168.66.121\",\"id.resp_p\":8080,\"trans_depth\":24,\"method\":\"GET\",\"host\":\"node1\",\"uri\":\"/api/v1/clusters/metron_cluster?fields=Clusters/desired_configs/cluster-env\\u0026_=1484168423682\",\"referrer\":\"http://node1:8080/\",\"user_agent\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.95 Safari/537.36\",\"request_body_len\":0,\"response_body_len\":0,\"tags\":[]}}, key=null, timestamp=1527122185741}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFetch from the tail end of the topic.

Contributor Comments\r\nSeen during attempt to cut 0.5.0-RC1.\r\n\r\nAs previously seen in:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1373\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1163\r\n\r\nI went and made it a \"*\" exclusion.  There was some concern that if we see this change, we should potentially be rechecking the license for version changes.  In that light, is this change too broad?\r\n\r\nTo make sure it works, you have to do a bit more work than just building it.\r\n```\r\ngit archive --prefix=apache-metron-0.5.0/ <branch-name> | gzip >  apache-metron-0.5.0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nuntar this file somewhere of your choice.\r\n```\r\ntar xvfz apache-metron-0.5.0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\ngo to apache-metron-0.5.0/metron-interface/metron-alerts and run\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install apache-rat:check -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build should succeed (and fail without this commit).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && dev-utilities/build-utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR downgrades our Solr version from 6.6.2 to 5.5.4.  The purpose of this change is to catch any incompatibilities with 5.5.4 at compile time rather than at runtime when using Solr 5.5.4.  In theory Solr client code compiled with 5.5.4 should work with 6.6.2.\r\n\r\nAll changes were fairly minor.  A summary includes:\r\n\r\n- disabled Solr auto-configuration in REST\r\n- changed Solr client instantiation to be compatible with 5.5.4\r\n- changed Solr collection listing call to be compatible with 5.5.4\r\n- changed Kerberos configuration to be compatible with 5.5.4\r\n- updated the in-memory SolrComponent to be compatible with 5.5.4\r\n\r\nI tested this in full dev with HDP Search 2.2 (Solr 5.5.4) and could not find any issues.  I also enabled Kerberos and everything worked as expected.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is built on #1024 and should not be merged until #1024 is addressed.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nI created a `KAFKA_FIND` function that allows you to provide a filter expression so that only messages satisfying a condition are returned.   For example...\r\n\r\n- Find a message that has been enriched with geolocation data.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_EXISTS('geo.city', m))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Find a Bro message.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'bro')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe message is presented to the filter lambda expression as a map of field values.  This makes creating the filter expression a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nLike the other `KAFKA_*` functions, this is not intended to be highly performant.  This is only intended to make the process of creating and modifying enrichments simpler in the REPL.  See the **Use Case** section for more details on how I see this being used.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nIf we were in the future to provide map literals in Stellar, this would become a fair bit simpler.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> m['source.type'] == 'bro')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nWhen creating enrichments, I often find that I want to validate that the enrichment I just created was successful on the live, incoming stream of telemetry. My workflow looks something like this.\r\n\r\n1. Create and test the enrichment that I want to create.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ip_src_addr := \"72.34.49.86\"\r\n    72.34.49.86\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> geo := GEO_GET(ip_src_addr)\r\n    {country=US, dmaCode=803, city=Los Angeles, postalCode=90014, latitude=34.0438, location_point=34.0438,-118.2512, locID=5368361, longitude=-118.2512}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. That looks good to me. Now let's add that to my Bro telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      \"enrichment\" : {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {\r\n          \"stellar\": {\r\n            \"config\": [\r\n               \"geo := GEO_GET(ip_src_addr)\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"threatIntel\": {\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENTS\", conf, \"bro\")\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3.  It looks like that worked, but did that really work?\r\n\r\n    At this point, I would run `KAFKA_GET` as many times as it takes to retrieve a Bro message. You would just have to get lucky and hope that the enrichment worked and secondly that you would pull down a Bro message (as opposed to a different sensor).\r\n\r\n    I would rather have a function that lets me only pull back the messages that I care about. In this case I could either retrieve only Bro messages.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'bro')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Or I could look for messages that contain geolocation data.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_EXISTS('geo.city', m))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Created the `KAFKA_FIND` function along with unit tests.\r\n\r\n* Updated all KAFKA_* functions to use a standard `getArg` function so that argument handling is all done the same way.\r\n\r\n###  Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR is built on the shoulders of #1023.  To review the change specific to this PR, review the changes made in the second commit or wait until #1023 is merged.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Enhances the KAFKA_PUT function to accept either a list of strings or a string.  This makes it simpler to send either 1 message or a bunch of messages.\r\n\r\n* KAFKA_PUT should queue up all messages to be sent before waiting on a response.  This improves response time when sending a large number of messages.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL in the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Tail some messages from Kafka\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   msgs := KAFKA_TAIL(\"bro\", 10)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Put those message back onto a new topic.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   KAFKA_PUT(\"new-topic\", msgs)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate that the 10 messages landed on the new topic.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Changes\r\n\r\n1. KAFKA_TAIL now performs manual partition assignment and correctly uses the Kafka API to seek to the end of the topic.\r\n \r\n    Previously, the function messed with the 'group.id' to effectively seek to end.  This is an abuse of the API.  Also, a fixed group.id is required for using the KAFKA_* functions in a Kerberized cluster.\r\n\r\n1. The unit tests for KAFKA_TAIL were improved.\r\n \r\n1. KAKFA_GET and KAFKA_TAIL now use a more accurate mechanism for adhering to the user's requested max wait time.\r\n\r\n    Previously, the max wait was divided by the max poll timeout to estimate how many times Kafka should be polled before returning to the user.  This method is not always accurate when some poll requests return values and others do not.\r\n\r\n1. The MPack now defines a global property `bootstrap.servers` which allow the KAFKA_* functions to work out-of-the-box after a Metron installation.\r\n\r\n    Previously, a user had to manually define this property before using the KAKFA_* functions.  If the property is not defined correctly, they would have to wait an excessive amount of time for the connection to timeout since there is no means in the REPL to interrupt a function call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL in the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Tail some messages from Kafka\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   KAFKA_TAIL(\"bro\")\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Get some messages from Kafka.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   KAFKA_GET(\"bro\")\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`ElasticsearchWriter` has a mechanism to transform the field names of a message before it is written to Elasticsearch.  Right now this mechanism is hard-coded to replace all '.' dots with ':' colons.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism was needed for Elasticsearch 2.x which did not allow dots in field names.  Now that Metron supports Elasticsearch 5.x this is no longer a problem. A user should be able to configure the field name transformation when writing to Elasticsearch, as needed.  \r\n\r\nWhile it might have been simpler to just remove the de-dotting mechanism, this would break backwards compatibility.  Taking this approach provides users with an upgrade path.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis change allows the user to configure the field name converter as part of the index writer configuration.  \r\n\r\nAcceptable values include the following.\r\n* `DEDOT`: Replaces all '.' with ':' which is the default, backwards compatible behavior.\r\n* `NOOP`: No field name change.\r\n\r\nIf no \"fieldNameConverter\" is defined, it defaults to using `DEDOT` which maintains backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nA cache of `FieldNameConverter`s is maintained since the index writer configuration can be changed at run-time and each sensor has its own index writer configuration.\r\n\r\nAn example configuration looks-like the following.\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"hdfs\" : {\r\n        \"enabled\" : false\r\n      },\r\n      \"elasticsearch\" : {\r\n        \"index\" : \"bro\",\r\n        \"batchSize\" : 5,\r\n        \"enabled\" : true,\r\n        \"fieldNameConverter\": \"NOOP\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"solr\" : {\r\n        \"enabled\" : false\r\n      }\r\n    } \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Code Changes\r\n\r\n* Added the `fieldNameConverter` parameter to the Index writer configuration.\r\n\r\n* Moved the `FieldNameConverter` implementations to a dedicated package in `metron-common`.\r\n\r\n* Renamed `ElasticsearchFieldNameConverter` to `DeDotFieldNameConverter`.\r\n\r\n* Implemented the `NoopFieldNameConverter` which does not modify the field name.\r\n\r\n* Created `FieldNameConverters` class that allows a user to specify either `DEDOT` or `NOOP` to choose the appropriate implementation.\r\n\r\n* Implemented a `CachedFieldNameConverterFactory` that encapsulates all the logic for choosing and instantiating the appropriate `FieldNameConverter`.  \r\n\r\n* Updated `ElasticsearchWriter` to use the `CachedFieldNameConverterFactory`.\r\n\r\n* Updated the README to document the new configuration parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Manual Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch a development environment and login.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate the environment by ensuring alerts are visible in the Alerts UI and that the Ambari Service Check completes successfully.  This ensures that the change is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n1. Login to the Storm UI and enable DEBUG logging for `org.apache.metron.common` and `org.apache.metron.elasticsearch`.\r\n\r\n1. The Storm worker logs in `/var/log/storm/worker-artifacts/random_access_indexing*/worker.log` should contain the following log statements, if you have enabled DEBUG logging correctly.  This shows that the default `DEDOT` converter is in-use.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    2018-05-22 14:38:... [DEBUG] Renamed dotted field; original=source.type, new=source:type\r\n    2018-05-22 14:38:...

[DEBUG] Renamed dotted field; original=adapter.threatinteladapter.begin.ts, new=adapter:threatinteladapter:begin:ts\r\n    2018-05-22 14:38:... [DEBUG] Renamed dotted field; original=enrichments.geo.ip_dst_addr.location_point, new=enrichments:geo:ip_dst_addr:location_point\r\n    2018-05-22 14:38:... [DEBUG] Renamed dotted field; original=adapter.threatinteladapter.end.ts, new=adapter:threatinteladapter:end:ts\r\n    2018-05-22 14:38:... [DEBUG] Renamed dotted field; original=enrichmentsplitterbolt.splitter.end.ts, new=enrichmentsplitterbolt:splitter:end:ts\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ./bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Change the field name converter to NOOP.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"hdfs\" : {\r\n        \"enabled\" : false\r\n      },\r\n      \"elasticsearch\" : {\r\n        \"index\" : \"bro\",\r\n        \"batchSize\" : 5,\r\n        \"enabled\" : true,\r\n        \"fieldNameConverter\": \"NOOP\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"solr\" : {\r\n        \"enabled\" : false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"INDEXING\", conf, \"bro\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. It can take up to 5 minutes for the topology to pick-up this change.  The old `FieldNameConverter` needs to expire from the cache first.\r\n\r\n1. Go back to the Storm worker logs.  When the change takes effect, we should see a log like the following indicating that the `NoopFieldNameConverter` was created.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    2018-05-22 16:... [DEBUG] Created field name converter; sensorType=bro, configuredName=NOOP, class=NoopFieldNameConverter\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. In the same logs, we will start to see tuples fail to be indexed.  Elasticsearch complains because the templates have been created to expect `source:type`, but that field no longer exists because the `FieldNameConverter` was changed.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    2018-05-22 16:0...[ERROR] Failing 1 tuples\r\n    org.elasticsearch.index.mapper.MapperParsingException: Could not dynamically add mapping for field [source.type].

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is against the feature branch.\r\n\r\nThere's a hard limit of ~32kb on string fields.  This migrates the raw_message fields to an unanalyzed TextField type, along with making it a dynamic field to handle the split into raw_messages_<number>.\r\n\r\nAn integration test is added for this behavior which ensures no error is thrown on huge text, ensures the multiple values work as expected the say way, and that a plain string field does actually cause problems.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR sets us up to run YARN and MR jobs inside our REST application.  Changes include:\r\n- addition of maven dependencies\r\n- addition of -Dhdp.version parameter to the REST startup script\r\n- MPack now supplies the hdp.version parameter\r\n- MPack now sets up a \"metron\" service user HDFS directory needed for running MR jobs\r\n- MPack now sets up a pcap HDFS directory \r\n- addition of a Pcap controller with a single Fixed Pcap Query endpoint and service to demonstrate running MR jobs in REST\r\n\r\nThe fixed pcap query endpoint submitted here should match the functionality in the metron-api module with a few minor differences:  \r\n\r\n- the default input and output paths are spring properties instead of hardcoded in classes (this will make it easier to expose them in Ambari if we choose to)\r\n- query results are not cleaned up automatically since that work is captured in a separate Jira\r\n- num reducers is defaulted to 1 instead of 10\r\n\r\nUnit and integration tests are included and this has been tested in full dev.  I tested this by generating sample pcap data with the PcapTopologyIntegrationTest.  You can do this by either:\r\n\r\n- running the test in your IDE and pausing it after the topology has generated data\r\n- commenting out `clearOutDir(outDir);` and running the test\r\n\r\nPcap data should be present in `/metron/metron-platform/metron-pcap-backend/target/pcap/data_dir`.  Upload the `pcap*` files to the `/apps/metron/pcap` directory in HDFS.  You should be able to perform the tests in PcapTopologyIntegrationTest using REST and get the same results.  \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"endTime\": 1458240269424,\r\n  \"startTime\": 1458240269419\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nshould return 2 pcap results.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nshould return 20 pcap results.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"ipDstAddr\":\"207.28.210.1\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nshould return no pcap results.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"ipDstPort\": 22\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/pcap/fixed'\r\n```\r\nshould return 10 pcap results.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/metron-dev/201805.mbox/%3CCAEVkqPbxzJNU_WGRbFWnZ-MVqnKb7mthEdvEQ9PLYhwfiT7F0g@mail.gmail.com%3E\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nUpdates to alerts will now be reflected in metaalert child alerts.  This was caused by the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao class calling the update method on IndexDao directly rather than calling it's own update method.  Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.  Find an alert.\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    \"guid\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"snort\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 1\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/search'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a metaalert from the alert in step 1.\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"dc4abb51-3b7e-4875-b3af-a03b5fd783d9\",\r\n      \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"test\"\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/metaalert/create'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Update the original alert.\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X PATCH --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"dc4abb51-3b7e-4875-b3af-a03b5fd783d9\",\r\n  \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n  \"patch\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\": \"add\"\r\n        , \"path\": \"/newField\"\r\n        , \"value\": \"value\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/update/patch'\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Verify the change was applied to the alert.  The \"newField\" field should be present.\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"dc4abb51-3b7e-4875-b3af-a03b5fd783d9\",\r\n  \"index\": \"snort\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/findOne'\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Verify the change was also applied to the child alert in the metaalert.  The \"newField\" field should also be present in the child alert.\r\n```\r\ncurl -u user:password -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"a76e0bae-4420-4f31-b2b3-234cd9fb9e60\",\r\n  \"index\": \"metaalert\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/findOne'\r\n```\r\nI hit another bug when testing that resulted from timestamp being set to 0 when updating metaalert objects.  Since it was keeping this use case from working I added the fix to this PR.  I also added a change to HBaseDao to guard against this in the future and a test to go with it.\r\n\r\nI verified this in full dev.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nI did exactly what the Jira description suggested.  Added a test case as well.  I did have to adjust the document comparison logic in the integration test to ignore child alert order.\r\n\r\nI have verified this in full dev.  Steps to reproduce are also in the Jira description:\r\n- Metaalert is updated to inactive\r\n- (Former) child alert is updated\r\n- Metaalert is made active again\r\n- Verify the child alert in the metaalert has the update applied\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Specifically, even though the cache max size is 2, the cache can exceed that size for short periods of time until cache maintenance is performed.  \r\n\r\nSince the cache can be larger than expected for brief periods of time, the expectations of what is a hit or miss were incorrect.  This is why the test would fail intermittently.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I rewrote the test so that the cache stats are validated after each expression is run and I also perform cache maintenance between each execution and validation of cache state.\r\n\r\nWithout the additional logging, the ability to grab more detailed cache stats, and breaking down that test case, I wouldn't have been able to uncover the bug.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a property `stellar.cache.record.stats` that allows recording of cache usage stats. \r\n\r\n* Updated the tests to use the stats produced by Caffeine.\r\n\r\n* Added log statements.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

configuration property `topology.kryo.register` for Storm that specifies the classes which should use Kryo serialization.  Storm requires that you specifically tell it which classes should undergo Kryo serialization.  \r\n\r\n* If an advanced user creates a profile that results in a user-defined type (a class not already in `topology.kryo.register`) this property allows them to register the class for Kryo serialization.  This could happen if a user is using a 3rd party library containing Stellar functions.\r\n\r\n* Updated the existing integration tests to force them to serialize tuples and to fail if Java serialization is used.\r\n\r\n* Created another integration test that creates a profile that uses the STATS library.  This ensures that the STATS library can be Kryo serialized.\r\n\r\n* Updated the README to reflect this change.\r\n\r\n* Updated all Profiler classes to be Java serializable in case a user chooses to use Java serialization in their Storm topology.  This is not recommended, but there is no reason to block a user from doing so.\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Alter the Profiler properties. \r\n\r\n    Set the Profiler duration to 1 minute.\r\n    ```\r\n    profiler.period.duration=1\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Force the topology to fail if Kryo serialization is not used.\r\n    ```\r\n    topology.fall.back.on.java.serialization=false\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Force the topology to serialize values, even with a single worker.\r\n    ```\r\n    topology.testing.always.try.serialize=true\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Restart the Profiler.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    storm kill profiler\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/start_profiler_topology.sh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a Profile that uses the STATS library.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"profile-with-stats\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":   { \"stats\": \"STATS_INIT()\" },\r\n          \"update\": { \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, 1)\" },\r\n          \"result\": \"stats\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\",conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait until a flush event occurs, then attempt to retrieve the profile values.  If values can be retrieved, the change has been successful.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> stats := PROFILE_GET(\"profile-with-stats\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    [org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@c8bab446, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@2990520a, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@f6affafd, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@de0d511, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@9247daa4, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@ddef62a6, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@2e6874a6, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@8568c433, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@dc65d27e, org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@28b2e728]\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> STATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(stats))\r\n    1.0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nInstead of 'source:type' being hard coded as a string in the Alerts UI, we now use a global-config service to retrieve whether a user's setup is using \"source:type\" or \"source.type\" syntax (e.g. elastic search or solr). The app default's to using \"source:type\" if no configuration is specified.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR upgrades Spring to version [5.0.5.RELEASE](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/) and Spring Boot to version [2.0.1.RELEASE](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/).  A summary of the changes included in this PR (all related to metron-rest):\r\n\r\n- Incremented Spring maven dependency versions\r\n- Added documentation for creating authentication tables\r\n- Incremented Jackson version to match the version Spring depends on\r\n- Added an explicit dependency on JsonPath to avoid conflicts with the provided metron-parsers uber jar\r\n- Disabled auto-configuration for Gson and Kafka to avoid version conflict problems that result from metron-parsers and metron-elasticsearch including these classes on the classpath.\r\n- Disabled automatic logging configuration to avoid version conflict problems that result from metron-elasticsearch including log4j2 classes on the classpath\r\n- Updated the JpaConfiguration class to match newer constructor\r\n- Configured a NoOpPasswordEncoder to satisfy the password encoder requirements introduced in newer versions of Spring\r\n- Fixed a bug in the test profile related to the Spring banner\r\n- Added the default application.yml as a configuration file since it is no longer added by default when the --spring.config.location option is used\r\n- Updated depedencies_with_url.csv to include all of the recent versions introduced by the upgrade\r\n\r\nI tested this in full dev by manually interacting with all the REST endpoints including:\r\n\r\n- creating and editing alert UI settings\r\n- creating, updating, and deleting the various configs (global, parser, enrichment, indexing)\r\n- listing, getting and validating grok statements\r\n- creating, reading, updating, and deleting HDFS files\r\n- creating, listing, deleting Kakfa topics as well as consuming and producing messages\r\n- performing searches, lookups, groupings, and updates with our DAO endpoints\r\n- creating and editing metaalerts\r\n- stopping, starting and getting status of Storm topologies\r\n\r\nI also went through the exercise of configuring a MySQL database for authentication.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

only way to alter the output topic for a Parser topology is to manually launch the topology using the CLI with the `-ot` parameter.  The user needs to be able to define this as part of the sensor's parser configuration so that the value is stored in Zookeeper and can be altered in the Management UI and launched from Ambari.\r\n\r\n## Manual Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/develoment/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate the development environment. \r\n    * Ensure the 'Service Check' is successful.\r\n    * Ensure alerts are visible in the 'Alerts UI'.\r\n\r\n1. Stop all topologies.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nI had to resolve several conflicts when merging master into the Solr feature branch.  I think it would be a good idea for this to be reviewed and tested by others.

Contributor Comments\r\nA few things happened here.\r\n\r\n* I had the Solr IP field return FieldType.IP as the type. If someone knows a reason this should be reverted/changed, let me know.\r\n* All the test \r\nschemas except for the \"test\" schema were removed.  They were outdated versions of actual schemas that we use.\r\n* The tests that used them, in particular `SearchIntegrationTest.java` was updated to refer to the actual schemas\r\n* Some minor test data changes occurred, e.g. `duplicate_field_name` to `ttl` (which is an actual field that conflicts in type between bro and snort).\r\n* Fix to dynamic fields in the `SolrColumnMetadataDao`.  Prior to this fix, only the fields defined in the schema would be returned by the DAO.  Now it will return both schema fields and dynamic fields that are used in practice (e.g. `threat:triage:score` is not explicitly defined, it matches a pattern and receives type float).  It may be worth renaming this PR and Jira, since this is an actual bug that came out of this testing.  However, this testing change is fairly necessary for the PR (since we didn't have the dynamic fallbacks in the old schemas and why bother fixing schemas we want to delete anyway).\r\n* Cleaned up the tests so it was more obvious what was being tested in particular.  The tests no longer hit every field, but a reasonable subset (otherwise bro would be a couple hundred fields).\r\n* `SolrSearchDao` now has a catch for `SolrException`.  Oddly, changing which type went into the wrong place changed the exception (e.g. int into text or text into int).  It seems reasonable to catch that exception rather than letting things blow up.\r\n\r\nI also ran it up in full dev, switched over to Solr.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that something like `threat:triage`score` didn't appear (as it would be dynamic).\r\n\r\nI then pushed this piece of Bro data through (that will hit a typed dynamic field and the overall ignored typed fallback field).  The new fields at the end are `threat:triage:score` and `fake.field`.\r\n```\r\n{\"http\": {\"ts\":1524842503.557505,\"uid\":\"CUQVlMYsuW1ySX8z8\",\"id.orig_h\":\"192.168.138.158\",\"id.orig_p\":49185,\"id.resp_h\":\"62.75.195.236\",\"id.resp_p\":80,\"trans_depth\":1,\"method\":\"GET\",\"host\":\"ubb67.3c147o.u806a4.w07d919.o5f.f1.b80w.r0faf9.e8mfzdgrf7g0.groupprograms.in\",\"uri\":\"/\",\"referrer\":\"http://va872g.g90e1h.b8.642b63u.j985a2.v33e.37.pa269cc.e8mfzdgrf7g0.groupprograms.in/?285a4d4e4e5a4d4d4649584c5d43064b4745\",\"user_agent\":\"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)\",\"request_body_len\":0,\"response_body_len\":8973,\"status_code\":200,\"status_msg\":\"OK\",\"tags\":[],\"resp_fuids\":[\"FdMX8Q3FciDFIl5Gt4\"],\"resp_mime_types\":[\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"],\"threat:triage:score\":1.0,\"fake.field\":\"fake\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result for Bro, per the REST API now has the fields:\r\n```\r\n  ...\r\n  \"method\": \"TEXT\",\r\n  \"threat:triage:score\": \"FLOAT\",\r\n  \"response_to\": \"TEXT\",\r\n  ...\r\n  \"adapter.geoadapter.begin.ts\": \"OTHER\",\r\n  \"fake.field\": \"OTHER\",\r\n  \"authentication_method\": \"TEXT\",\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis Pull Request includes work started by @iraghumitra on his branch `e2e-using-await-1`. In addition to the asyn/await work he did, I added [protractor-flake](https://github.com/NickTomlin/protractor-flake) in order to re-run failing tests to ensure they are actual failures and not the result of flakey tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to test locally, be sure to install protractor-flake before running the e2e tests. This is done by running `npm install` inside of the metron-alerts directory.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently our advice is to use the Stellar field transformation to do simple field renaming.  Given how common this situation is and how the old field must be nulled out, thus making the stellar transformation awkward, it's worthwhile having a specialized field transformer for RENAME.\r\n\r\n* Create a new parser by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json` to have the following content:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"dummy\",\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n         { \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n         ,\"output\" : [ \"new_field\"]\r\n         ,\"config\" : {\r\n           \"new_field\" : \"JOIN( [ TO_UPPER(source.type), field ], ',' )\"\r\n                     }\r\n         },\r\n         { \"transformation\" : \"RENAME\"\r\n         , \"config\" : {\r\n             \"new_field\" : \"newer_field\"\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Create the dummy kafka topic via `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n* Push the zookeeper configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Start the parser via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s dummy`\r\n* Create some dummy data by creating a file at `~/dummy.dat` with the following:\r\n```\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f1\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f2\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f3\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f4\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f5\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f6\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f7\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n```\r\n* Send the dummy data in via `cat ~/dummy.dat | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic dummy`\r\n* Ensure the data written to the indices has a field `newer_field` that looks like `DUMMY,${field}` and no `new_field`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

created a `KAFKA_FIND` function that allows you to provide a filter expression so that only messages satisfying a condition are returned.   For example...\r\n\r\n- Find a message that has been enriched with geolocation data.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_EXISTS('geo.city', m))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Find a Bro message.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'bro')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe message is presented to the filter lambda expression as a map of field values.  This makes creating the filter expression a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nLike the other `KAFKA_*` functions, this is not intended to be highly performant.  This is only intended to make the process of creating and modifying enrichments simpler in the REPL.  See the **Use Case** section for more details on how I see this being used.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nIf we were in the future to provide map literals in Stellar, this would become a fair bit simpler.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> m['source.type'] == 'bro')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\n\r\nWhen creating enrichments, I often find that I want to validate that the enrichment I just created was successful on the live, incoming stream of telemetry. My workflow looks something like this.\r\n\r\n1. Create and test the enrichment that I want to create.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ip_src_addr := \"72.34.49.86\"\r\n    72.34.49.86\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> geo := GEO_GET(ip_src_addr)\r\n    {country=US, dmaCode=803, city=Los Angeles, postalCode=90014, latitude=34.0438, location_point=34.0438,-118.2512, locID=5368361, longitude=-118.2512}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. That looks good to me. Now let's add that to my Bro telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      \"enrichment\" : {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {\r\n          \"stellar\": {\r\n            \"config\": [\r\n               \"geo := GEO_GET(ip_src_addr)\"\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"threatIntel\": {\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENTS\", e, \"bro\")\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n3.  It looks like that worked, but did that really work?\r\n\r\n    At this point, I would run `KAFKA_GET` as many times as it takes to retrieve a Bro message. You would just have to get lucky and hope that the enrichment worked and secondly that you would pull down a Bro message (as opposed to a different sensor).\r\n\r\n    I would rather have a function that lets me only pull back the messages that I care about. In this case I could either retrieve only Bro messages.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'bro')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Or I could look for messages that contain geolocation data.\r\n    ```\r\n    KAFKA_FIND('indexing', m -> MAP_EXISTS('geo.city', m))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Created the `KAFKA_FIND` function along with unit tests.\r\n\r\n* Defined the global property `bootstrap.servers` by default during the MPack install.  This allows all of the `KAKFA_*` functions to work out-of-the-box.  Previously, a user would have to manually define this value before using any of the `KAFKA_*` functions.\r\n\r\n###  Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

[METRON-1529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1529) includes step to replicate the issue.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This change is dependent on #982 .  It should only be merged after #982.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThe root cause is not clear, but must be due to the way in which Zeppelin launches the interpreters and keeps them isolated from the core of Zeppelin itself.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, there really is no need for a cache to back `CONFIG_GET`.  The function should always go to Zookeeper to get the latest configuration values.  This simplifies the implementation and solves the problem at-hand.\r\n\r\nThe changes relevant to this PR include the following.\r\n\r\n* [`metron-platform/metron-management/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/management/ConfigurationFunctions.java`](https://github.com/apache/metron/compare/master...nickwallen:METRON-1529?expand=1#diff-00b9178e2e80b694bac96e387f434ec9)\r\n\r\n* [`metron-platform/metron-management/src/test/java/org/apache/metron/management/ConfigurationFunctionsTest.java`](https://github.com/apache/metron/compare/master...nickwallen:METRON-1529?expand=1#diff-187b5eaaf0be7dc001aaa47388444036)\r\n\r\n* [`metron-platform/metron-common/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/common/configuration/ConfigurationsUtils.java`](https://github.com/apache/metron/compare/master...nickwallen:METRON-1529?expand=1#diff-b8d2f6514e881628a94f49e342bc7be)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* The unit tests were enhanced to validate this change.  \r\n\r\n* I have validate this change in the CentOS dev environment\r\n\r\n* I have tested this in the Zeppelin REPL by following the steps outlined in [METRON-1529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1529).\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-18 at 11 51 06 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/38943392-48370022-42ff-11e8-9485-55ee7f67c7a5.png)\r\n\r\n* I have tested this in the CLI REPL by launching the REPL using the following command and then running the same set of Stellar commands.\r\n\r\n        java -cp \"metron-stellar/stellar-common/target/stellar-common-0.4.3.jar:metron-platform/metron-management/target/metron-management-0.4.3.jar:metron-platform/metron-parsers/target/metron-parsers-0.4.3-uber.jar:~/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-simple/1.7.9/slf4j-simple-1.7.25.jar\"  org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.cli.StellarShell -z localhost:2181\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-18 at 11 54 21 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/38943413-57e2608e-42ff-11e8-8937-6fdf63c7ecf9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nSolr automatically expands location type fields internally when a document is indexed.  This causes a problem in our DAO layer because we don't do partial updates (we reindex the whole document) and these expanded fields are included in the updated document.  This PR strips these expanded fields out in the SolrUpdateDao before updating.\r\n\r\nI also added a unit test to cover this case.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [ ] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && dev-utilities/build-utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a Vagrant config change to enable the use of vagrant-cachier to reduce build times for the full dev platform. Time saving is heavily network dependent, but anecdotally I've found it saves me around 10 mins per provision of vagrant development environment. YMMV.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n1. Install vagrant-cachier, and spin up centos and ubuntu vagrant development platforms.\r\n2. Verify that packages are populated into your local (the client running vagrant) ~/.vagrant/cache directories.\r\n3. vagrant destroy your development environments\r\n4. spin up vagrant environments again, packages should be pulled from the cache instead of the network at this point.\r\n5. spin up a vagrant environment on a machine that does not have cachier installed and ensure that the dev platform still builds\r\n\r\nNote that the vagrant-cachier plugin is not required, nor shipped, bundled or in any way distributed by this change. It does have a compatible license (MIT) but it is outside of the Metron project scope to install this, so there is no need to update license or dependency documentation.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently the JSONMapParser does not function because an anonymous inner class (TypeRef) is not serializable.\r\n\r\n* Create a new parser by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json` to have the following content:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"dummy\",\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n         { \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n         ,\"output\" : [ \"new_field\"]\r\n         ,\"config\" : {\r\n           \"new_field\" : \"JOIN( [ TO_UPPER(source.type), field ], ',' )\"\r\n                     }\r\n         }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Create the dummy kafka topic via `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n* Push the zookeeper configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Start the parser via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s dummy`\r\n* Create some dummy data by creating a file at `~/dummy.dat` with the following:\r\n```\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f1\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f2\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f3\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f4\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f5\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f6\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f7\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n```\r\n* Send the dummy data in via `cat ~/dummy.dat | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic dummy`\r\n* Ensure the data written to the indices has a field `new_field` that looks like `DUMMY,${field}`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Contributor Comments\r\nGiven how important caching is in the enrichment topology, we should have caching for stellar field transformations in the parsers as well.\r\n\r\nBeyond a smoketest ensuring data flows into the indices, you may test this by creating a new parser with a field transformation and ensuring stellar field transformations function as expected.\r\n\r\n* Create a new parser by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json` to have the following content:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"dummy\",\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n         { \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n         ,\"output\" : [ \"new_field\"]\r\n         ,\"config\" : {\r\n           \"new_field\" : \"JOIN( [ TO_UPPER(source.type), field ], ',' )\"\r\n                     }\r\n         }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Create the dummy kafka topic via `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n* Push the zookeeper configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Start the parser via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s dummy`\r\n* Create some dummy data by creating a file at `~/dummy.dat` with the following:\r\n```\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f1\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f2\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f3\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f4\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f5\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f6\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n{ \"field\" : \"f7\", \"source.type\" : \"dummy\" }\r\n```\r\n* Send the dummy data in via `cat ~/dummy.dat | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic dummy`\r\n* Ensure the data written to the indices has a field `new_field` that looks like `DUMMY,${field}`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1445\r\n\r\nThe current performance tuning guide can be challenging to follow for those not familiar with the system. This PR updates the guide to provide details about how and where to find tuning parameters along with details as to how the properties are materialized in a running topology.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a supplement to the tuning guide has been provided to pull Metron cluster debugging info into a tarball. As pertains to the perf guide, it captures the state of Ambari configuration, flux files, properties files, and zk config. This helps users confirm system state as they make tuning changes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

That code relied on a class that is only available in Storm 1.0.3+.  When using the Maven profile `HDP-2.5.0.0`, the code is built against Storm 1.0.1, where that class is not defined.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* This completely removes the use of a`StormTimer`.  There is no need for it.  I had thought it would help me drive testing, but it has not ended up being useful at all.  \r\n\r\n* An executor is used to drive a separate thread which flushes expired profiles on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n\r\n* Run a development environment and ensure that alerts are visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-10T19:32:03Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T19:31:11Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T21:17:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"265dbc85e8f8d62875258b54ca7a8128340c2ac3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/336ceb6f1a23a571f236079c5d31e24e408bd5b3","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-1518","ref":"METRON-1518","sha":"336ceb6f1a23a571f236079c5d31e24e408bd5b3","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

recently introduced an alternative enrichment topology; the Unified enrichment topology.  This is an alternative to the existing Split Join topology.  This work enhances the MPack so that a user can configure, stop, and start either the Unified or the Split Join enrichment topology.  \r\n\r\n* The Split Join topology remains the default Enrichment topology.\r\n\r\n* A combo box allows the user to choose which Enrichment topology should be run.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-05 at 5 41 52 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/38395683-27272e9a-3902-11e8-9be6-bbd3fbe0ee68.png)\r\n\r\n* Each topology has a separate configuration section under the Metron > Enrichment settings in Ambari.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-04-05 at 5 42 19 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/38395690-3188795c-3902-11e8-8064-0288e424d142.png)\r\n\r\n* The `bin/start_enrichment_topology.sh` script was enhanced so that you can pass in the `--filter` and `--remote` args directly to launch an alternative topology.  Running the script with no parameters will launch the default topology; Split Join.\r\n\r\n* The Unified topology had previously reused some of the same settings from the Split Join topology.  Where it made sense, the Unified topology was updated to use its own logically named properties.\r\n\r\n*  There are now separate properties file for each Enrichment topology. \r\n    `$METRON_HOME/config/enrichment-splitjoin.properties`\r\n    `$METRON_HOME/config/enrichment-unified.properties`\r\n\r\n* There are separate flux files for each Enrichment topology. \r\n    `$METRON_HOME/flux/enrichment/remote-splitjoin.yaml` \r\n    `$METRON_HOME/flux/enrichment/remote-unified.yaml`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n\r\nTo test this change, launch a development environment.  The Split Join Enrichment topology will be running by default.  Switch to the Unified topology.  Change some settings and make sure they are reflected in the topology.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
