Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR is introducing capability for Record Key Auto Generation\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nAt present ingesting data into Hudi has a few unavoidable prerequisites one of which is specifying record key configuration (with record key serving as primary key). Necessity to specify primary key is one of the core assumptions built into Hudi model centered around being able to update the target table efficiently.\r\n\r\nHowever, some payloads actually don't have a naturally present record key: for ex, when ingesting some kind of \"logs\" into Hudi there might be no unique identifier held in every record that could serve the purpose of being record key, while meeting global uniqueness requirements of the primary key. Nevertheless, we want to make sure that Hudi is able to support such payloads while still providing for Hudi's core strength\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n1. Auto-generated record keys have to provide for global uniqueness w/in the table, not just w/in the batch. \r\nThis is necessary to make sure we're able to support updating such tables.\r\n2. Keys should be generated in a way that would allow for their efficient compression\r\nThis is necessary to make sure that auto-generated keys are not bringing substantial overhead (on storage and in handling)\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\nTo support payloads with no naturally present record key, here we're proposing to enable new mode of operation for Hudi where synthetic, globally unique (w/in the table) record key will be injected upon persistence of the dataset as Hudi table.\r\n\r\nFor achieving our goal of providing globally unique keys we're planning on relying on the following synthetic key format comprised of 2 components\r\n\r\n - (Reserved) Commit timestamp: Use reserved commit timestamp as prefix (to provide for global uniqueness of rows)\r\n - Row id: unique identifier of the row (record) w/in the provided batch\r\n\r\nCombining them in a single string key as below\r\n\r\n```\"${commit_timestamp}_${batch_row_id}\"```\r\n\r\nFor row-id generation we're planning on using generator very similar in spirit to `monotonically_increasing_id()` expression from Spark to generate unique identity value for every row w/in batch (could be easily implemented for any parallel execution framework like Flink, etc)\r\n\r\nPlease note, that this setup is very similar to how currently `_hoodie_commit_seqno` is produced.\r\n\r\nComplete key-generation is implemented as Spark's `AutoRecordKeyGenExpression` making it compatible w/ Sparks' Whole-Stage Codegen (WSC) therefore making automatic key-generation very efficient.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd hash partition in spark datasoure.\r\n It is often difficult to find an appropriate partition key in the existing data. Hash partitioning can easily solve this problem.\r\n\r\nHow to use hash partition in spark data source can refer to hudi/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/DataSourceOptions.scala#testHashPartition\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact if the hash partition parameters are not specified.\r\n\r\nWhen hash.partition.fields is specified and partition.fields contains _hoodie_hash_partition, a column named _hoodie_hash_partition will be added in this table as one of the partition key.\r\n\r\nIf predicates of hash.partition.fields appear in the query statement, the _hoodie_hash_partition = X predicate will be automatically added to the query statement for partition pruning.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow .\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nTo be continued.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability for adding source conversion error events to error table . \r\n*Approach* : \r\n\r\n-  Track error events in `SourceFormatAdapter` \r\n-  Track error events from `WriteStatus`\r\n-  Added new WriteClient for error table `BaseErrorTableWriter` \r\n-  If commit to error table fails then throw error so that delta sync fails . \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow (The feature is disabled by default)\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nFix typo in use of ShellOption annotation in CommitsCommand class. There were three places where the \"--\" prefix was missing.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nMakes the following CLI flags actually available to be used by the user. Currently these were in the code but there was no way to invoke it:\r\n1. commit showpartitions --includeArchivedTimeline\r\n2. commit show_write_stats --includeArchivedTimeline\r\n3. commit showfiles --includeArchivedTimeline\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nLow. Exposes existing functionality that was getting suppressed by mistake.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nThe shell option will show up automatically in the hudi-cli help.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently we maintain a single Metrics instance per table (and a separate one for metadata table). That means we create a separate instance for PushGateway, the client for push gateway. This implies that we have a connection pool per hudi table, that is leading to a lot of open/waiting/blocked TCP connections on the push gw, possibly causing it to crash. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we ensure that we use a single PushGateway instance per hostname and port, ensuring we only maintain a single connection pool per PushGw Server Instance\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nReduces chance of exception\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPreviously, we found that Spark Datasource read of metadata table was broken and the issue is fixed by #7924.  However, the `TestMetadataTableWithSparkDataSource` guarding the exact same functionality did not fail in CI or local mvn command below.  After investigation, the Hudi Spark configs (`spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.catalog.HoodieCatalog`, `spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.HoodieSparkSessionExtension`) are not properly added to the Spark session in the test environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the proper Hudi Spark configs for Spark Datasource tests and adds one more test on reading metadata table through Spark Datasource.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAfter this change, without the fix #7924, the following test fails which is consistent with the behavior of spark-shell (previously it passed without raising the alarm).\r\n```\r\nmvn clean test -Dspark3.3 -Dscala-2.12 -DwildcardSuites=\"abc\" -Dtest=TestMetadataTableWithSparkDataSource -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark -am\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe current `scripts/release/deploy_staging_jars.sh` took around 6 hours to upload all release artifacts to the Apache Nexus staging repository, which is too long.  After analyzing the upload sequence, there are repeated uploads of the same module that can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully reviewing the deploy script and logs, I make the following changes to cut down the upload time by 70%, without changing the intended jars for uploads:\r\n- For each profile (e.g., `-Dscala-2.12 -Dspark3.2`), only make one mvn build\r\n- Remove overlapping build targets among different profiles\r\n  - For Spark 2.4, Scala 2.11: `hudi-spark-common_2.11`, `hudi-spark_2.11`, `hudi-spark2_2.11`, `hudi-utilities_2.11`, `hudi-cli-bundle_2.11`, `hudi-spark2.4-bundle_2.11`, `hudi-utilities-bundle_2.11`, `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle_2.11`\r\n  - For Spark 2.4, Scala 2.12: `hudi-spark2.4-bundle_2.12`\r\n  - For Spark 3.2, Scala 2.12: `hudi-spark3.2.x_2.12`, `hudi-spark3.2plus-common`, `hudi-spark3.2-bundle_2.12`\r\n  - For Spark 3.3, Scala 2.12: `hudi-spark3.3.x_2.12`, `hudi-cli-bundle_2.12`, `hudi-spark3.3-bundle_2.12`\r\n  - For Spark 3.1, Scala 2.12: all other modules and bundles (`hudi-cli-bundle_2.12` is not overridden)\r\n\r\nLegacy Spark bundles and Flink bundles are not changed.\r\n\r\nRaw logs:\r\n- Summary of existing upload sequence: [deploy_sequence.txt](https://github.com/apache/hudi/files/10719044/deploy_sequence.txt)\r\n- Last modified times of uploaded artifacts for analyzing the relevant upload and profile: [staging_file_timestamp.txt](https://github.com/apache/hudi/files/10719051/staging_file_timestamp.txt)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSignificantly reduces the time (by ~70%, from 6 hours to <2 hours) of uploading all release artifacts to the Apache Nexus staging repository.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-13T05:51:35Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T17:13:28Z","closed_at":"2023-02-13T06:14:31Z","merged_at":"2023-02-13T06:14:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"a932e482408b72b3901404027c09e2623f5a038a","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/1a60557c79318f62571a2f71d69abd7e567e4aa5","head":{"label":"yihua:HUDI-5771-improve-deploy-script","ref":"HUDI-5771-improve-deploy-script","sha":"1a60557c79318f62571a2f71d69abd7e567e4aa5","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196439401,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mzk0MDE=","name":"hudi","full_name":"yihua/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yi

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPartitions created by Async indexer could be deleted by regular writers. This patch is fixing this flow.\r\n\r\nDetails of how this could happen: \r\nIn regular writer we have a flow, where we detect if some MDT partition is not enabled, but the partition is found in storage and as part of table config's fully built out partitions, hudi deletes the metadata partition with the intent that user wishes to disable it. \r\n\r\nBut this does not sit well w/ async indexer. \r\n\r\nprocess1 -> Deltastreamer runs continuously. \r\nno metadata configs set. \r\nwhich means, default value for metadata enable = true and hence \"files\" partition will be instantiated inline on first commit. \r\nno value set for col stats enable. So, no action will be taken. \r\n\r\nprocess2: user starts HoodieIndexer for col stats partition. \r\nOnce indexer completes, tableConfig will add \"col stats\" as part of fully built out metadata partition.  \r\n\r\nWhile in process1, when deltastreamer goes to next write(after indexer completes), it will detect that col stats wasn't enabled (default value as per code), but tableConfig shows that col stats is fully built out, and hence decides to delete the col stats partition and updates the tableConfig. Essentially the partition built by async indexer will immediately be deleted by regular writer.\r\n\r\nFix: \r\nAdded explicit tracking to value set by the user for col stats enable and bloom filter enable and use it for deducing deleting metadata table partitions. This is just an internal property tracker which cannot be set by the user. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAsync indexer can be used by users in all diff scenarios. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two issues:\r\n- Makes the rollback of indexing delta commit lazy in the metadata table, otherwise it would be cleaned up eagerly by other regular writes.\r\n- Uses a suffix (`004`) appending to the up-to-instant used by the async index to avoid collision with existing completed delta commit of the same instant time.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes async indexer commit complete successfully.  Tested with the scenario locally.  A new test is added to guard around the behavior.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow.  Only affecting the scenarios where async indexer runs.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRFC-46 modified `HoodieKey` to substantially optimize its serialized footprint (while using Kryo) by making it explicitly serializable by Kryo (inheriting form `KryoSerializable`, making it final).\r\n\r\nHowever, this broken its binary compatibility w/ the state as it was in 0.12.2. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this entailed that as this class is used in `DeleteRecord` w/in `HoodieDeleteBlock` that it also made impossible to read such blocks created by prior Hudi versions (more details in HUDI-5758).\r\n\r\nThis PR restores previous state for `HoodieKey` to make sure it stays binary compatible w/ existing persisted `HoodieDeleteBlock` created by prior Hudi versions\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\nHudi do not support add column on mor table with log when `extractPartitionValuesFromPartitionPath` is turned on. \r\n\r\nIf partition pruning is enable, it will pruned out default values from avro schema, which is due to incorrect conversion logic in SchemaConverters::toAvroType. This PR fixed the issue by adding a default null value when converting StructType to Avro FieldType.\r\n\r\nThus, HoodieBaseRelation::convertToAvroSchema has the correct behavior and the mor table is queryable.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdding support for EPOCHMICROSECONDS in TimestampBasedAvroKeyGenerator\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers can pass value EPOCHMICROSECONDS to config hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.type, key gen field is parsed into the correct partitions i.e. yyyy/mm/dd\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nFor testing I created a jar locally with hudi-utilities-bundle_2.12-0.12.2 with my code change and substituted it in my Spark job - it worked as planned, microsecond timestamps are being partitioned as expected now. Running Google Dataproc Hudi Deltastreamer job, reading from Confluent Cloud Debezium Avro Kafka topic, writing Hudi outputs to S3.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nThis would require an update to the keygen timestamp.type in the documentation to include EPOCHMICROSECONDS in [this section of the documentation](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2021/02/13/hudi-key-generators/#timestampbasedkeygenerator)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- As of now, we expect users to set some of the mandatory fields in every write. For eg, record keys, partition path etc. These cannot change for a given table and gets serialized into table config. In this patch, we are adding support to re-use table configs. So, users can set these configs only in the first commit for a given table. Subsequent writes might re-use from table config if not explicitly set by the user. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves user experience as users don't need to set N no of configs repeatedly. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nMight need to call it out in our release highlight, that users don't need to set the table configs again and again. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreate standard annotation for enums that is used to set config defaults, restrict input choices, and automate documentation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally reworded many of the annotations so those all need to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake our documentation more clear. Additionally this should make code more readable by adding comments to many enums that previously had none.\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nMight want to add some info in the contribution section about config style.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's
