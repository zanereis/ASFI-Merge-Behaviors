Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Hudi-native HFile reader implementation independent of HBase.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nHudi uses HFile format as the base file format for storing various metadata, e.g., file listing, column stats, and bloom filters, in the metadata table (MDT), as HFile format is optimized for range scans and point lookups.  [HFile format](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#_hfile_format_2) is originally designed and implemented by [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/).  Historically, Hudi is tightly coupled with Hadoop ecosystem.  Even now, popular engines like Spark, Flink, and platforms like EMR still rely on Hadoop dependencies for various functionality.  So Hudi has chosen to directly use the HFile reader implementation provided by HBase.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a couple of problems:\r\n1. The required HBase dependencies make the bundle jar heavy and cause dependency conflict, compatibility issues, and interference with actual HBase index usage in some environments (see for example #5372 #6509 #7899).  HBase does not provide an independent module for HFile reader and writer, thus we have to add many HBase dependencies and custom shading rules.\r\n2. HBase is tightly coupled with Hadoop ecosystem, and cannot be used by a query engine that is Hadoop independent, such as Trino, which has its own `TrinoFileSystem` abstraction independent of Hadoop.  Thus, Trino Hudi connector cannot read HFiles and the metadata table based on the current implementation.\r\n\r\nTo address these two problems, one way is to port the relevant code of the HFile reader from HBase to the Hudi repo and maintain it.  We have attempted this in #4695, but the LoC is more than 60K, which is large.  The main problem is that there is a lot of code irrelevant to HFile that is included but not easy to trim due to the coupling with HBase functionality.\r\n\r\nThis led us to a better first step: to implement a Hudi-native HFile reader from scratch based on what Hudi really uses and make it independent of HBase library.  This PR serves the purpose.\r\n\r\n#### Approach\r\n\r\nWe follow the HFile format version 3 and only focus on what Hudi uses on the reader side.  We summarize a simplified HFile format for Hudi in `hudi-io/hfile_format.md`.  Our Hudi-native HFile reader follows this format specification.  This means that the Hudi-native HFile reader can read the HFiles written by an HBase HFile writer used by Hudi without any problem.\r\n\r\nThe Hudi-native HFile reader provides almost the same semantics as the HBase HFile reader and scanner:\r\n- All the HBase HFile reader APIs used by Hudi have similar or counterpart API in the Hudi-native HFile reader, so the upper layer can easily integrate the new HFile reader;\r\n- At the core, the Hudi-native HFile reader provides the seek API `int seekTo(Key key)`, which enables multiple seeks with sorted keys, and each seek operation should move the cursor to the HFile inside the reader when necessary.  This is essential for point lookups, range scan, and prefix lookup.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new `hudi-io` module for I/O related functionality, and the Hudi-native HFile reader implementation sits inside the new module.\r\n\r\nA new interface `HFileReader` is defined to support reading HFile with seeks.  Here are the APIs:\r\n- `int seekTo(Key key)`: seek to or just before the passed lookup key.  The return code indicates whether the key is found and what the current cursor points to:\r\n  - `-1`: when the lookup key is less than the first key of the file. The cursor points to the first key of the file.\r\n  - `0`: when the lookup key is found in the file.  The cursor points to the matched key in the file.\r\n  - `1`: when the lookup key is not found, but it's in the range of the file. The cursor points to the greatest key that is less than the lookup key.\r\n  - `2`: when the lookup key is greater than the last key of the file, EOF is reached. The cursor points to EOF.\r\n- `boolean seekTo()`: positions the cursor of this reader at the start of the file.\r\n- `boolean next()`: move the cursor to the next entry in the file.\r\n- `Option<KeyValue> getKeyValue()`: the key-value pair at the current cursor or position.\r\n- `boolean isSeeked()`: whether one of the seek calls is invoked.\r\n- `Option<byte[]> getMetaInfo(UTF8StringKey key)`: gets info entry from file info block of a HFile.\r\n- `Option<ByteBuffer> getMetaBlock(String metaBlockName)`: gets the content of a meta block from HFile.\r\n- `long getNumKeyValueEntries()`: total number of key-value entries in the HFile.\r\n- `void initializeMetadata()`: initializes metadata based on a HFile before other read operations.\r\n\r\n`HFileReaderImpl` is an implementation of `HFileReader`. Here are some important classes created to support the `HFileReaderImpl`:\r\n- `BlockIndexEntry`: represents the index entry of a data (or meta) block in the Data (or Meta) Index stored in the ROOT_INDEX block.\r\n- `HFileBlock`: an abstract class representing a block in a HFile.  It is extended by `HFileDataBlock`, `HFileMetaBlock`, `HFileRootIndexBlock`, and `HFileFileInfoBlock` for different block types.\r\n- `HFileBlockReader`: reads and parses one or more HFile blocks based on the start and end offsets.\r\n- `HFileCursor`: stores the current position and key-value pair at the position in the HFile.  The same instance is used as a position cursor during HFile reading.\r\n- `HFileTrailer`: represents a HFile trailer, read first to understand the structure of the HFile.\r\n- `KeyValue`: represents a key-value pair in the data block.\r\n- `Key`: represents the key part only.\r\n- `UTF8StringKey`: represents a UTF8 String key only, with no length information encoded.  This is used by lookup key.\r\n\r\nThe high-level algorithm of `seekTo` based on a lookup key is:\r\n1. if the lookup key is beyond the range of the current data block (greater or equal to the first key of next block if present), a binary search of the key in the data block index is done to figure out the right data block to read, then move on to <2.>;\r\n2. if the lookup key is within the range of the current data block, based on the data block index, sequential read the key-value pairs until a matched key is found or the first time the key in the HFile is greater than the lookup key.\r\n\r\nSame as HBase HFile scanner, `seekTo(key)` does not support backward seek and the Hudi-native HFile reader throws an exception in this case.  Before doing a backward seek, the caller has to call `seekTo()` again to reposition the cursor to the beginning of the file.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nComprehensive unit tests have been added to `TestHFileReader` to test the new Hudi-native HFile reader.  The integration of the Hudi-native HFile reader done by #10330 will also test the HFile reader functionality end-to-end.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRemoves dependency on HBase to read HFiles, which makes it much easier for engine integration, along other benefits mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe have documented the HFile format.  We will update the RFC accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T02:38:49Z","updated_at":"2024-03-09T22:17:23Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T18:09:52Z","merged_at":"2024-01-18T18:09:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"48ce342a19bc047915e7fc50105db5738b4f2f68","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4210243667,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM768zhT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/reader-core","name":"reader-core","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5167491007,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNAGnvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-1.0.0","name":"release-1.0.0","color":"E82785","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/10241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/54195223d071f56c572aecee344a516fb41203df","head":{"label":"yihua:HUDI-7170-new-hfile-reader","ref":"HUDI-7170-new-hfile-reader","sha":"54195223d071f56c572aecee344a516fb41203df","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196439401,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mzk0MDE=","name":"hudi","full_name":"yihua/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repo

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn HUDI-7110 , a tool has been made available to display column stats. However, this tool is not very user-friendly for manual observation when dealing with large data volumes. For instance, with tens of thousands of parquet files, the number of rows in column stats could be of the order of hundreds of thousands. This renders the data virtually unreadable to humans, necessitating further processing by code. Yet, if an administrator simply wishes to directly observe the data layout based on column stats under such circumstances, a more intuitive display tool is required. Here, we offer a tool that calculates the overlap degree of column stats based on partition and column name.\r\n\r\nOverlap degree refers to the extent to which the min-max ranges of different files intersect with each other. This directly affects the effectiveness of data skipping.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a similar concept is also provided by Snowflake to aid their clustering process. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-micropartitions Our implementation here is not overly complex.\r\n\r\nIt yields output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n|Partition path |Field name |Average overlap  |Maximum file overlap |Total file number |50% overlap        |75% overlap        |95% overlap        |99% overlap        |Total value number |\r\n|path           |c8         |1.33             |2                   |2                |1                 |1                 |1                 |1                 |3                  |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis content provides a straightforward representation of the relevant statistics.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider three files: a.parquet, b.parquet, and c.parquet. Taking an integer-type column 'id' as an example, the range (min-max) for 'a' is 1–5, for 'b' is 3–7, and for 'c' is 7–8. Thus, there will be overlap within the ranges 3–5 and 7.\r\n\r\nIf the filter conditions for 'id' during data skipping include these values, multiple files will be filtered out. For a simpler case, if it's an equality query, 2 files will be filtered within these ranges, and no more than one file will be filtered in other cases (possibly outside of the range).\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO: In the future, we hope that this foundation can inspire and be expanded upon to use overlap as a guide for clustering data layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThis procedure is designed to calculate and display the overlap degree of column statistics for different files within a table, which is a key factor in evaluating the performance of data skipping strategies.\r\n\r\nParameters and Output Schema\r\nThe procedure accepts the following parameters:\r\n\r\ntable (StringType, required): The name of the table for which column statistics overlap will be calculated.\r\npartition (StringType, optional): A specific partition or comma-separated list of partitions to limit the scope of the calculation.\r\ntargetColumns (StringType, optional): A specific column or comma-separated list of columns for which to calculate the statistics.\r\nThe output of the procedure is a structured type (StructType) comprising the following fields, which describe various aspects of column statistics overlap for each field within the specified partitions or table:\r\n\r\nPartition path\r\nField name\r\nAverage overlap\r\nMaximum file overlap\r\nTotal file number\r\n50% overlap\r\n75% overlap\r\n95% overlap\r\n99% overlap\r\nTotal value number\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-01T06:38:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T02:32:55Z","closed_at":"2023-12-05T02:32:55Z","merged_at":"2023-12-05T02:32:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"315924a3b6e2430be1c5662b1111acb696c8deae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3382222382,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM7JmJ4u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark-sql","name":"spark-sql","color":"5BAEBC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3782563563,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM7hdVbr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/cli","name":"cli","color":"8E1E55","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/10226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/10226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/22f5d8a5c8f2719aa9602958913fef1e2ee969b9","head":{"label":"majian1998:column-stats-overlap","ref":"column-stats-overlap","sha":"22f5d8a5c8f2719aa9602958913fef1e2ee969b9","user":{"login":"majian1998","id":47964462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTY0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47964462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998","html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":668640931,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ9qmow","name":"hudi","full_name":"majian1998/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"majian1998","id":47964462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTY0NDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47964462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998","html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/majian1998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/majian1998/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\nCurrently, we use `precombine.field` as `eventtime.field`. \r\nGenerally speaking, **precombine**, **ordering** and **event time** are all time fields.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it is not

Change Logs\r\n\r\nA potential problem: \r\nIf the heartbeat client is updating the heartbeat time for the instant t1, then the write client completes the commit of the instant t1 and stops the heartbeat of the instant t1. \r\nAt this time, the try-catch that updates the heartbeat will catch an exception: `File does not exist`. \r\nWhen handling this exception, we should check again whether the heartbeat of t1 instant has been stopped by the writing client. \r\nIf it has been stopped, we should not throw this exception, but skip the update of this heartbeat directly. \r\nBut if has not been stopped, we should throw an exception at this time.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `HoodieStorage` abstraction and tries to remove the usage of Hadoop File System classes (`org.apache.hadoop.fs.`[`FileSystem`, `Path`, `FileStatus`], etc.) in core Hudi APIs, so it's much easier to plugin different file system implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is WIP.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves storage abstraction and APIs in Hudi.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNew abstraction and API changes for developers.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug which causes the `operationType` to be null in the commit metadata of bulk insert operation with row writer enabled in Hudi Streamer (`hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable=true`).  `HoodieStreamerDatasetBulkInsertCommitActionExecutor` is updated so that `#preExecute` and `#afterExecute` should run the same logic as regular bulk insert operation without row writer.\r\n\r\nThe tests are updated to validate the logic.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, the `operationType` is null in the commit metadata:\r\n```\r\n  \"operationType\" : null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the bug.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. For Spark3.5, add row index (record position) column to the parquet file reader and file group reader. For <= Spark3.4, no such column is added.\r\n2. For Spark3.5, enable record key related filters for positional merging; otherwise for <= Spark3.4.\r\n3. For Spark3.5, read row index (record position) column out from the record. For <= Spark3.4, the position is generated from the positional record buffer.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n1. Achieved the same filter pushdown functionality for both position and key based merging.\r\n2. Made positional based merging more useful.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow since we only enabled it for Spark3.5.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ]

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith files and functional index, it should be possible to read the table from spark-sql attached to an external catalog, say remote Hive Metastore, even when the partition metadata is not syned to the catalog.\r\n\r\n- Check whether partitions are passed to `HoodieCatalog`. If not, then use the metadata file system view to get the partitions.\r\n- Add a test for querying a table without syncing partition metadata.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  The change is in `HoodieCatalog` which is dependent on Spark 3.2. So, this feature is not available for Spark versions < 3.2.0. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nQuery a table from spark-sql that is syned to catalog without the partition metadata.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for the issue [10088](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/10088)/[Hudi-7034](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7034).\r\nThe issue is reproducible - the reproduction [here](https://github.com/VitoMakarevich/hudi-incremental-issue/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/example/hudi/HudiRefreshBug.scala).\r\nThe issue impact is that once loaded partition file slices are never changing(filenames). Therefore - partitions are not receiving updates and later we start receiving `FileNotFoundException` - due to the fact that some files to which index is stuck, were cleaned.\r\nThe way I fixed it is basically invalidated list of files in partitions, so the subsequent call to `getAllQueryPartitionPaths` will refresh the list of partitions and then this code will not see any cached file for any partition and refresh the list of files\r\n```\r\n    List<PartitionPath> missingPartitions = partitionPaths.stream()\r\n        .filter(p -> !cachedAllInputFileSlices.containsKey(p))\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no test created for this yet, I will try to add a unit test as well as direct `refresh view` test.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThere's no user-facing change, but I don't know all code-paths this code is used.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHard to assess\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n No need.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T12:21:00Z","updated_at":"2023-11-23T10:22:15Z","closed_at":"2023-11-23T10:22:15Z","merged_at":"2023-11-23T10:22:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcb974b48133273ec0ef3e33b91889c61609e8b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the DefaultHoodieRecordPayload to allow the records with custom delete key (hoodie.payload.delete.field) and delete marker (hoodie.payload.delete.marker) to be properly ingested. Before this fix, the write fails with the following exception\r\n\r\nError for key:HoodieKey { recordKey=0 partitionPath=} is \r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: No value present in Option\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.Option.get(Option.java:89)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.model.HoodieAvroRecord.prependMetaFields(HoodieAvroRecord.java:132)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.doWrite(HoodieCreateHandle.java:144)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieWriteHandle.write(HoodieWriteHandle.java:180)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:98)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:42)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.util.queue.SimpleExecutor.execute(SimpleExecutor.java:69)\r\nThe bug is introduced by the RFC-46 implementation and the refactoring on payload merging.\r\n\r\nFix is to override isDeleted(Schema schema, Properties props) to deserialize the bytes and call into isDeleteRecord(incomingRecord, props, schema). That way, we will not change any public apis nor constructor. DefaultHoodieRecordPayload might incur a slight perf hit, but comparing with changing \r\n ~ 50 files (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9892/), we are going with confined fix just in DefaultHoodieRecordPayload. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixing DefaultHoodieRecordPayload to honor deletion based on meta field as well as custom delete marker. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBy using HadoopFsRelation.\r\n\r\nSolved a bunch of bugs for CDC queries, including:\r\n\r\n1.

Fixed the way to initialize the meta client in the file format. \r\n4. Fixed the NULL file index problem by removing the file format initialization.\r\n5.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Allows users to reuse a running timeline server for other tables\r\n- Minor performance improvements around object reuse and creation\r\n- Use of AfterburnerModule where we saw a 22% increase in throughput for to/from json on the base file DTOs used in the timeline server\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Allows users to lower overhead when running multiple writers in the same JVM by reusing the underlying server instance\r\n- Performance improvement in the json (de)serialization\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow - feature for reusing the server is off by default\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6144, a new compaction trigger strategy was added named `NUM_COMMITS_AFTER_LAST_REQUEST`, org.apache.hudi.table.action.compact.CompactionTriggerStrategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the FlinkOptions description was not updated to include this new trigger strategy. Adding it in so that configs page on doc-site will reflect this trigger strategy for completeness.\r\n\r\n**TODO:** \r\nMight need to do some refactoring to centralise these common config so that we do not have to worry about these de-sync in the future. Might also make it easier for testing.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe enabled time travel queries for COW tables based on HadoopFsRelation, which uses FG reader file format, and fixed bugs related.  Changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Enabled time travel queries for COW tables;\r\n2. Moved file format object initialization from the constructor into a function to avoid the NULL file index error caused by lazy initialization.\r\n3.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTime travel queries should be more stable.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLOW since this is for 1.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
