some minor refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe lookup logic in operators is identical to the one on task groups (in a function of the same name), so let's reuse the logic instead of having to maintain two loops

better to keep the extra abstraction

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34309\r\n\r\nSince we do some weird stuff with the `try_number` property, we have to do some weird stuff in order to properly search / display it in the UI 🥴:\r\n\r\n1) Overriding `try_number.expression` so that sqlalchemy only sees the actual `try_number` value when searching or filtering.\r\n2) Swapping in the `prev_attempted_tries` property in place of the `try_number` property in order to display the actual `try_number` value. \r\n\r\nThis causes the UI to function as expect, only showing + filtering on the actual value from the DB:\r\n<img

`hybrid_property` expression in particular might cause some issues down the line. I am going to see how complicated it would be to remove the weird try_number property altogether, moving the `try_number+1` logic to a separate property or selectively incrementing the value where required.\r\n\r\nAll feedback and suggestions

fix to #34587.\r\n\r\nThis changes the logic in views to look for a parent mapped task group (so to decide whether a task group is mapped) from using a recursive function to an iterative loop. This should help prevent RecursionError when a DAG has deeply-nested task groups. I hope no-one really writes such a DAG in practice, but you never know. Also in cases both solutions work, the loop should generally be faster anyway due to how CPython is implemented.","created_at":"2023-09-26T06:50:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T14:42:10Z","closed_at":"2023-09-27T00:43:26Z","merged_at":"2023-09-27T00:43:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9ba152c15dd50baa1fef41a63424225ba8ddd47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

No breaking changes, but adds a lot of code into this Operator. I can also propose a PR with a new _PaginatedHttpOperator_ if better ?\r\n\r\n#### Use case:\r\nI have been facing a very specific use-case where the API:\r\n- Returns data (as JSON) in a paginated way\r\n- Do not provide any way to know in advance how much pages / entries will be returned\r\n- Provides a \"next_page_cursor\" attribute, which is a random id, to do paginated calls\r\n\r\n_Dynamic Tasks?_  It works like a for loop. In this case, knowing in advance the number of pages means calling the API two times. Which is inefficient, and do not guarantee all pages are traversed during the second call.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

KubernetesPodTrigger to take startup timeout into account when Pod hangs on the ErrImagePull or ContainerCreating state and etc. due to incorrect images, mounts, or network issues and it will never complete.\r\nThere were two problems:\r\n1. When a pod is starting it has pending status and its base container can have two statuses undefined or waiting so I added to take into account waiting status as well as undefined in the KubernetesPodTrigger\r\n2. Problem in the callback method execute_complete in KubernetesPodOperator when a task returns from the deferred mode with timeout status it tries to wait for pod completion but the pod with problems such as  ErrImagePull or bad mounts and etc. will never complete so I've excluded the waiting for the timeout

that cleared tasks wait for indirect setup tasks was fixed in #33903.  That fix entailed applying logic similar to ALL_SUCCESS logic for just the indirect upstream tasks before moving on to the evaluation of direct upstreams.\r\n\r\nThis had the benefit of similicity and isolation -- it would only be called for tasks that had indirect upstreams and it would be layered on top of the existing trigger rule dep logic -- not mixed in.\r\n\r\nBut it resulted in new round trips to the db when there is an indirect setup.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does is try to get all the upstream TI info in one

GCSToGoogleDriveOperator and gdrive system tests:\r\n- fixed race conditions in system tests when they run in parallel\r\n- added cleaning up to system tests, because files uploaded to gdrive remain there and it affects sensors regardless of what is going on in the current test run\r\n- changed the default value for  the attribute `GCSToGoogleDriveOperator.destination_folder_id` for making it consistent with `GoogleDriveHook.folder_id = \"root\"`. Previously the operator was passing the `None` value to the hook that expects only strings, which caused

This will temporarily fix the issue that raises exceptions and prevents tasks from running when OTEL metric names are too long. \r\n\r\nHowever it isn't a long-term fix because any new metric added will still have the ability to prevent tasks from running.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34154\r\n\r\nThe `remove_task_decorator` can incorrectly truncate function bodies if there are specific comments in the function body present, which is a rare edge case but can lead to _really_ misleading behaviour where only a part of the intended code is executed. \r\n\r\nI think that the correct way to do code manipulation like this would be to lean on the `ast` library, but the ability to go from ast back to code was only added in python 3.9 with the `ast.unparse()` function. \r\n\r\nAnyways, this PR is an attempt to improve the accuracy of this method. While I don't think that this is perfect, it at least solves the issue for the cases in the linked issue with the following changes:\r\n - only early exiting if a line _starts_ with the decorator name\r\n - splitting the code at most one time\r\n\r\nAny suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you want to discuss this IRL, come find me at Airflow Summit :)
