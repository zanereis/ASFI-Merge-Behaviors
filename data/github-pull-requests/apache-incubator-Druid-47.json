CLUSTERED BY clauses. Also, as a result, it disallows parsing insert statements that do not have a PARTITIONED BY.\r\n\r\n`explain.ftl` encapsulates the logic to do so.\r\n\r\nCode cleanup is also done since after this change, there is no need to handle SqlInsert and DruidSqlInsert separately in DruidPlanner's ParsedNodes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `explain.ftl`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR reworks how the SQL planner constructs `DruidExpression` and how it translates them into `VirtualColumn` when constructing the native query.\r\n\r\nPrior to the changes in this PR, `DruidExpression` were flattened string expressions, eagerly constructed into a `VirtualColumn` via the `VirtualColumnRegistry`, whenever required for use in projections, aggregations, filters, etc. This meant that basically all of the expression structure was lost after converting to the string expression, making it impossible to modify them to try to optimize the query prior to conversion the the native JSON query.\r\n\r\nNow, `DruidExpression` retains the expression tree structure, each containing a `List<DruidExpression>` that contains any sub-expressions which at the time of virtual column creation is built into the string expression, using a newly added interface\r\n```\r\n  public interface ExpressionBuilder\r\n  {\r\n    String buildExpression(List<DruidExpression> arguments);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich is added to the `DruidExpression` when it is created. Another new interface has been added to aid in rewriting `DruidExpression` trees before planning into a native `Query`\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public interface DruidExpressionShuttle\r\n  {\r\n    DruidExpression visit(DruidExpression expression);\r\n\r\n    default List<DruidExpression> visitAll(List<DruidExpression> expressions)\r\n    {\r\n      List<DruidExpression> list = new ArrayList<>(expressions.size());\r\n      for (DruidExpression expr : expressions) {\r\n        list.add(visit(expr));\r\n      }\r\n      return list;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(along with a `visit` method on `DruidExpression` to accept the shuttle).\r\n\r\n`DruidExpression` are also now annotated, with one of 4 roles, `LITERAL`, `IDENTIFIER`, `EXPRESSION`, and `SPECIALIZED`, the last of which, coupled with the shuttle visitor, is the primary motivator of this PR.\r\n\r\nUsing `MV_FILTER_ONLY`/`MV_FILTER_NONE` as an example, which has a \"native\" specialized `VirtualColumn` implementation, any expression which supplies such a specialized implementation will now always use it.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, when used in some composition, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT MV_LENGTH(MV_FILTER_ONLY(dim3, ARRAY['b'])), SUM(cnt) FROM druid.numfoo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis function would use a fall-back expression\r\n```\r\n\"virtualColumns\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"expression\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"v0\",\r\n    \"expression\" : \"array_length(filter((x) -> array_contains(array('b'), x), \"dim3\"))\",\r\n    \"outputType\" : \"LONG\"\r\n  } ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut now plans to this instead\r\n```\r\n\"virtualColumns\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"expression\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"v0\",\r\n    \"expression\" : \"array_length(\\\"v1\\\")\",\r\n    \"outputType\" : \"LONG\"\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"type\" : \"mv-filtered\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"v1\",\r\n    \"delegate\" : {\r\n      \"type\" : \"default\",\r\n      \"dimension\" : \"dim3\",\r\n      \"outputName\" : \"dim3\",\r\n      \"outputType\" : \"STRING\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"values\" : [ \"b\" ],\r\n    \"isAllowList\" : true\r\n  } ],\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn the process, I uncovered additional bugs with multi-value string array expressions, similar to the bugs fixed #12078 (and controlled by the flag #12210)\r\n\r\nNoteworthy: in addition to the behavior change of fixing the remaining bugs of `MV_` functions, specifically `MV_FILTER_ONLY` and `MV_FILTER_NONE` might have subtle behavior differences due to the new specialization code compared to the fall-back expression. the `filter` function used as the fall-back expression would return empty arrays where `ListFilteredVirtualColumn` would return `null`, so something like `MV_LENGTH(MV_FILTER_ONLY(...))` would report `0` as the length for rows which contained no values. However, using `MV_FILTER_ONLY(..)` directly would return `null` for these rows since it did previously plan to the `ListFilteredVirtualColumn`. This is fixed now, so `MV_LENGTH` will be `null` for these rows without values now.\r\n\r\nWe might want to consider adjusting the fallback `filter` expression of `MV_FILTER_*` to coerce empty arrays to nulls to behave consistently with `ListFilteredVirtualColumn`, but I did not do that in this PR.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidExpression`\r\n * `VirtualColumnRegistry`\r\n * `DruidQuery`\r\n * `OperatorConversions`\r\n * `ExpressionSelectors` (bug fix)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-08T11:55:37Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:34:24Z","closed_at":"2022-02-09T22:55:50Z","merged_at":"2022-02-09T22:55:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ee66bb492381ea1721c3355a7a5fc404a93d852","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` converts `BucketShardSpecs` to the corresponding `BuildingShardSpecs`, the order gets lost. This means that the newly assigned partitionIds are not in the same order as the original bucketIds.\r\n\r\nParticularly, for range partitioning, this results in the partitionIds not being in the same order as increasing partition boundaries. While not a bug, this can be potentially confusing and aesthetically displeasing.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Refactor `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask.groupGenericPartitionLocationsPerPartition`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\n- When a kinesis stream is resharded, the original shards are closed. A large number of intermediate shards may also be created in the process which are eventually closed as well. \r\n- If a shard is closed before any records are put into it, it would be ideal to ignore this shard for ingestion, to increase efficiency. Skipping such tasks can help avoid waste of task resources due to unnecessary allocation.\r\n- While we read from kinesis for shards frequently, both open and closed shards are returned and it is expensive to determine if a closed shard was ever written to, since it requires polling each shard for its records.\r\n- Skipping \"bad\" shards when counting the partitions also helps since fewer slots may be allocated by the autoscaler.\r\n\r\n\r\nKinesisRecordSupplier is used to get a list of all shards during Kinesis ingestion. \r\nAdditional methods have been added to determine which shards are closed and empty.\r\nRepetitive calls to kinesis for shards' records are avoided by maintaining an in-memory cache in the supervisor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Design:\r\n\r\n- The in memory cache is implemented in KinesisSupervisor to maintain closed shard (empty and non-empty, separately) to avoid making redundant expensive calls.\r\n- When the flag `skipIgnorableShards` is set to true, the cache is utilized and updated. This also means that \"ignorable\" shards no longer participate in task allocation for ingestion or for autoscaler estimations.\r\n- When a shard is discovered after being closed for the first time, it is added to the cache to ensure that unnecessary expensive calls are not made.\r\n- Active closed shards are computed to eliminate stale entries corresponding to expired shards\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n- All closed shards (not just the empty ones) are polled once, which can be an overhead.\r\n- Since metadata is not updated for these shards, each supervisor restart would incur the above overhead again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternative design:\r\n\r\nUpdate the metdata with end offsets of closed and empty shards. This may be simpler to implement since it doesn't require a cache but would lead to waste of resources since a task would have to update the metadata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KinesisSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#11520.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nKubernetes watches allow a client to efficiently processes changes to\r\nresources. However, they have some idiosyncrasies. In particular, they\r\ncan error out for various reasons leading to what would normally be seen\r\nas an invalid result.\r\n\r\nThe Druid kubernetes node discovery subsystem does not handle a certain\r\ncase properly. The watch can return an item with a null object.  These\r\nleads to a null pointer exception. When this happens, the provider needs\r\nto restart the watch, because rerunning the watch from the same resource\r\nversion leads to the same result: yet another null pointer exception.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the provider to handle null objects by restarting\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nA clean alternative to this would be to change the provider to use an [Informer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/blob/master/examples/examples-release-14/src/main/java/io/kubernetes/client/examples/InformerExample.java). I suspect this would simplify the code substantially while handling most if not all of the corner cases we could run into by using a bare watch. I don't quite have the time to undertake a large change like that, though, so I'm submitting this quick fix so that we can at least resolve the most common issue that seems to affect the kubernetes provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* DefaultK8sApiClient: now propagates the null object. Logs out a warning when this happens.\r\n* K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider: handles the null from the watch by restarting it. Logs a warning.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

The infrastructure to do so was not present, unfortunately, and I suspect it'd be a large undertaking. In terms of testing in a cluster, I reproduced the issue using [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/). I then reproduced it with my fix, showing that the error message no longer occurred in a tight loop, and discovery still worked (I restarted a pod. It discovered the new one)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-04T16:37:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:32:53Z","closed_at":"2022-03-10T20:56:40Z","merged_at":"2022-03-10T20:56:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"db91961af70c61ebe1cbe7c42c12309e85c477fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2592744529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTkyNzQ0NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Kubernetes","name":"Kubernetes","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45/labels","id":7818158,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Ad0uu","number":45,"title":"0.23.0","description":"Druid

a flag to allow auto compaction task slot ratio to consider auto scaler slots\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config in auto compaction setting allowing auto compaction to calculate ratio of slots available for compaction tasks from maximum slots including auto scaler maximum worker nodes instead of just the current cluster capacity. For example, if the cluster can scale to 10 workers (maxNumWorkers=10) where each worker has 2 slot then the ratio would be calculate from 20 instead of current workers running in the cluster (which could be less than 10 if the cluster is under low load). This will then allow auto compaction to scale up the cluster to speed up auto compaction progress. Documentations will follow in a separate PR. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis PR adds `ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG` which can aggregate array inputs together into a single array and improves `ARRAY_AGG` to support array inputs (if `druid.expressions.allowNestedArrays` is true).\r\n\r\n|Function|Notes|Default|\r\n|--------|-----|-------|\r\n|`ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG(expr, [size])`|Concatenates all array `expr` into a single ARRAY, with `size` in bytes limit on aggregation size (default of 1024 bytes).   Input `expr` _must_ be an array. Null `expr` will be ignored, but any null values within an `expr` _will_ be included in the resulting array. If the aggregated array grows larger than the maximum size in bytes, the query will fail. Use of `ORDER BY` within the `ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG` expression is not currently supported, and the ordering of results within the output array may vary depending on processing order.|`null`|\r\n|`ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG(DISTINCT expr, [size])`|Concatenates all distinct values of all array `expr` into a single ARRAY, with `size` in bytes limit on aggregation size (default of 1024 bytes) per aggregate. Input `expr` _must_ be an array. Null `expr` will be ignored, but any null values within an `expr` _will_ be included in the resulting array. If the aggregated array grows larger than the maximum size in bytes, the query will fail. Use of `ORDER BY` within the `ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG` expression is not currently supported, and the ordering of results will be based on the default for the element type.|`null`|\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAlso, two new options to `ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory` have been added, `shouldAggregateNullInputs` and `shouldCombineAggregateNullInputs` to both fix a correctness issue with `STRING_AGG` and `ARRAY_AGG` when merging results that include nulls, and as an optimization to aggregators that do not need to aggregate anything if any inputs are null.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-02T16:34:13Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:34:32Z","closed_at":"2022-02-08T03:59:31Z","merged_at":"2022-02-08T03:59:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae71e05fc5d0cec8f7ae78df25ccf4a45cfecfda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

the feature flag 'enableRewriteJoinToFilter' tries to rewrite a join as a filter when possible in inner joins. A correctness condition to do that rewrite requires all the keys on the build/right side of the join to be unique (since join would add multiplicity for duplicate keys).\r\nIf the values contain duplicates, we can still push them as filters but along with retaining the original join so that the correctness of results is maintained. This will help in reducing the data read by the system (when bitmap filtering is used) and also in less computation (the filtering is pushed below the join and even further whenever possible).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a super-simple PR to make unit testing just a bit less tedious. Unit test that set up a scan query frequently don't care about time, or want to query all time. Today, that requires hunting down the magic incantation and copy/paste it into the test. This PR adds a method, `eternity()` to the scan query builder to encapsulate that code to avoid the time spent hunting down an example (of which there seem to be three varieties.)\r\n\r\nThe actual test that spurred this change is in another, more complex PR. To verify and illustrate the change, existing tests were changed to use the new method.\r\n\r\nAlso include a small dose of code cleanup found along the way.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nDruid provides extensive extension support. Extension can define new services, but those services cannot yet be discovered. This PR ensures that they operate like native services. See [this ticket](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12218) for details.\r\n\r\nThe current code has a static list of node roles. This PR moves the list into a Guice multi-binder so that extensions can add to the list.\r\n\r\nNext, the SQL system servers table code is revised to use the Guice-provided list of node roles rather than the hard-coded list.\r\n\r\nThen, the `/druid/coordinator/v1/cluster` is added to include extension roles after the Druid-defined roles. The code imposed a specific order on the roles; those rules are preserved.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new endpoint `/druid/router/v1/cluster` is added. The logic here is that clients start with the router endpoint. To get the list of services, they must first get the list of services to get the coordinator. But, they can't get the list of services without first haven gotten that list. To avoid this Catch-22, the new endpoint provides the list of services from the router itself.\r\n\r\nOf course, the SQL servers system table also provides the list of services. The Catch-22 in this case is that if the cluster is broken, SQL is unavailable to help figure out which services are down. Having the native endpoint provides a reliable fallback: as long as the Router and ZK are up, we can learn about other services and see what is missing.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes some refactoring to make bits of role-related code usable in multiple contexts. Most of the code is not unit testable (we can't run servers in unit tests), but where it is testable, tests are added or modified.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n * `NodeRoles` - A Guice multi-binder to hold the list of Druid- and extension-defined node roles.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster, in the context of the actual extension service which this PR supports.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-01T18:58:38Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T16:53:00Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T16:52:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15bd62d8f6bc49dcb48da3503cd9a44fb99a4428","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design

Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nPrevents occurrence of deadlocks when multiple parallel batch index tasks are submitted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ImmutableWorkerInfo`\r\n * `WorkerHolder`\r\n * `WorkerSelectUtils`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe Overlord REST APIs return JSON for the successful cases, and use a filter to handle errors. Unfortunately, the error handler returns plain text, which breaks a client that expects to receive the JSON error format added in recent PRs. This PR converts the errors to JSON following the emerging standard.\r\n\r\nIn addition. the recently-added standard error handling has a couple of holes. If the code provides just an error message, then the error code (which is what is primarily shown) is blank. If just an error code, then the error message is blank. This PR says that if only one is provided, use it for both places.\r\n\r\nJackson provides ways to omit fields which are at a null value. This PR uses that feature to not include fields which are null, simplifying the returned error JSON.\r\n\r\nThis error handling was encountered in the process of creating an Overlord service. In doing that, it turned out that it was necessary to create a `TaskStatus`, but the constructor was private. This PR makes the constructor public at no loss of functionality.\r\n\r\nThe PR also contains a number of typo cleanups encountered during the work.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster as part of an overall

Description\r\n\r\nSee [Support Services in Extensions](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12218). Adds the support for an extension service in the `Main` routine, and provides the `PrivateApi` annotation to mark extension service REST endpoints as private.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows launching an extension service as:\r\n\r\n`<druid> server <extn>`\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, an extension service can be added more simply: just by introducing a new command. However the resulting command is:\r\n\r\n`<druid> <extn>`\r\n\r\nWhich introduces an odd asymmetry between built-in and extension servers. The proposed solution allows extension services to work identically to built-in services.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster (as part of the extension in question: hard to test by itself).\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-01T03:58:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T00:00:08Z","closed_at":"2022-02-03T00:00:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5475d435402d1daf34f32f1cae7aaedc9d4c18ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":222509152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1MDkxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Operations","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes # contains cherrypick commits from phab 0.16 to 0.23 version.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

java.lang.ClassCastException error when using useApproximateCountDistinct false for aggregation query\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn `PartialDruidQuery#withSelectProject` method, Druid assume that the `Rel` built by the `builderSupplier` is always a Project Rel. However, relBuilder.project do not create an identity project if it does not rename any fields unless we set the relBuilder.project `force` argument to `true` (this is because by default when `force` is set to false or not given, project() is permitted to no-op. If, for instance, the expressions are the identity projection). This PR set `force` to `true` when calling `relBuilder.project` to make sure that the Rel built is always a `Project` \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFollow up to #12078, adds `druid.expressions.homogenizeNullMultiValueStringArrays` with a default value of 'false'. If set to true, it opens an escape hatch to a backwards compatibility mode for the 'buggy' behavior of some multi-value string array functions such as `MV_APPEND` which was fixed in #12078. Prior to that PR, all `null`, `[]`, and `[null]` values were treated as `[null]`, which was only intended for implicitly mapped single value expression across multi-valued string rows, and could produce unintuitive results. This option has been added in case anyone happened to be depending on that behavior, but it produces odd behavior that impacts all array expressions, so it is not recommended to set this flag to true if possible, and instead add a workaround by coercing the values explicitly with additional expressions if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nThis PR adds two improvements to brokers. The first, is that `SystemSchema` was causing a second `ServerInventoryView` to be created to power the \"servers\" table, due to injecting `InventoryView`, which due to bindings uses a `ServerInventoryView` from the `ServerInventoryViewProvider`, while everything else on the broker uses `FilteredServerInventoryView` (including the `TimelineServerView` used by the \"server segments\" table which on brokers is `BrokerServerView` which uses `FilteredServerInventoryView`).\r\n\r\nThe \"servers\" table is only using the `InventoryView` to get `DruidServer`, which are not filtered afaict by any of the `FilteredServerInventoryView` implementations anyway, so it is safe to change `SystemSchema` to use this instead (and it is also more consistent with the \"server segments\" table to use the same inventory view).\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, during broker startup you would see\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-01-28T01:39:45,069 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - Start: started [true]\r\n2022-01-28T01:39:45,088 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.client.HttpServerInventoryView - Starting FilteredHttpServerInventoryView.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n2022-01-28T01:39:51,529 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.schema.MetadataSegmentView - MetadataSegmentView Started.\r\n2022-01-28T01:39:51,530 INFO [main] org.apache.druid.client.HttpServerInventoryView - Starting HttpServerInventoryView.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile after now only the `FilteredHttpServerInventoryView` can be observed to be started. \r\n\r\nThis might help reduce broker memory footprints by quite a bit since there won't be double the segment tracking happening! I believe this issue has existed since #7706.\r\n\r\nThe second change reduces the log verbosity when using the `HttpServerInventoryView` when it runs into any of the scenarios where it needs to perform a 'full sync' on a data server, which can result in \"duplicate\" segments getting added which causes a flurry of log \"warning\" messages (which are expected in this case). These log warnings are now suppressed when performing a full sync (but will still warn if it happens during a delta, where duplicates _are_ unexpected).\r\n\r\nIt was investigation of the latter issue which caused me to stumble into the former, where while debugging I noticed that I had completely separate inventory views running at the same time in my broker.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the ingestion task requires for you to specify the AWS region if you have `druid-s3-extensions` loaded _even when your ingestion task doesn't use s3_. This is because `OmniDataSegmentKiller` is being initialized when the Peon starts up which loads all implementations of `DataSegmentKiller` from extensions. This is a bug from UX perspective as the the user should be able to load the s3 extension without AWS region configured if they don't use any s3 stuff. This PR fixes `DataSegmentKiller` as well as  `DataSegmentMover` and `DataSegmentArchiver`, which have the same problem, to accept a client supplier instead of a client, so that the client is initialized when they are actually used. For example, `S3DataSegmentKiller` accepts a supplier of `s3Client` now. Since the AWS region is checked when `s3Client` is initialized and the supplier initializes `s3Client` when the killer is actually used, any ingestion jobs should now be able to run with the s3 extension loaded without AWS region unless they use s3 stuff. The ingestion job will fail when it tries to use extension stuff if something is not configured properly instead of at the beginning of the ingestion job. For example, a kill task that kills segments in s3 will fail when it calls s3 APIs instead of at the beginning of the task if the AWS region is not configured. This change is covered by integration tests as ingestion tests always use the kill task to clean up segments in deep storage after the test is done.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

address.\r\nAlso, we faced a problem in which we saw only the last metrics.\r\nApparently, each metric was sent separately and deleted the previous message.\r\nThe solution was to group all metrics and push them together.\r\n\r\n### Related Issue - #12199 \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Prometheus Emitter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

is a special corner case with a giant InFilter of numeric BoundFilters on a string column can cause a long bitmap operation which is non pre-emptive and thus increases segment processing time, which in turn can potentially block other queries.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this quick fix is to prevent such a problematic query from blocking all other queries.It is encouraged to set this property if you are running queries with giant IN clauses of numerics on strings\r\n\r\nThe new check applies when the SQLPlanner generates a native query which has only one IN filter in the where clause which is specifically IN filter of numerics on a string column.\r\n\r\nSet `maxNumericInFilters` to a smaller value to prevent prohibitively slow queries when filtering on numbers in string type dimensions. Setting the optimal limit requires some trial and error; we recommend starting with 100. For more than 100 numbers, prevent slow IN filters by casting the compared values as strings. For example, `WHERE someString IN ('123', '456')`. By default, Druid does not restrict the amount of numbers in an IN filter.\r\n\r\nThe value recommended (100) is determined by experimenting on a local system where \r\n\r\nDataset Rows | IN Filter size | query/segment/time (in ms) | After casting to String (query/segment/time in ms)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n1M | 10 | 40 | 2\r\n1M | 100 | 219 | 3\r\n1M | 1000 | 2165 | 38\r\n5M | 10 | 90 | 5\r\n5M | 100 | 824 | 9\r\n5M | 1000 | 9542 | 56\r\n\r\nWith 5M (the maxRowsPerSegment value) the acceptable time taken in a segment is expected to be kept under 1sec and hence 100 is chosen as the recommended limit on the number of numeric in filters\r\n\r\nThe value of `maxNumericInFilters` set through query context cannot exceed the system specified value through `druid.sql.planner.maxNumericInFilters`\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior now is:\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nWHERE metroCode IN (609,517,817,101,102,103)\r\n```\r\nThis runs as the default is set to -1 which in case ignores this check.\r\n\r\nNow if we change the query context as\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"maxNumericInFilters\": 4\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe following query now works as\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nWHERE metroCode IN (609,517,817,101,102,103)\r\n\r\nError: Unknown exception\r\nFilters for column [metroCode] exceeds configured filter limit of [4]. Cast [6] values to String\r\norg.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.CannotBuildQueryException\r\n```\r\nIf the query is now corrected, the same query goes through InFilters and not BoundFilters and the error is not shown and the query passes. An example is\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nWHERE metroCode IN ('609','517','817','101','102','103')\r\n```\r\nThe value through query context cannot be set to anything below 1 (but not -1) and would throw an error in such a case\r\n\r\nIn case the system specified value is set through common.runtime.properties as\r\n`druid.sql.planner.maxNumericInFilters=200`\r\n\r\nand the query context is set as \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"maxNumericInFilters\": 20000\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe following error would result\r\n```\r\nExpected parameter[maxNumericInFilters] cannot exceed system set value of [200]\r\n```\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes an issue with `StringAnyAggregatorFactory` which was incorrectly using a multi-value dimension selector when `ColumnCapabilities` were unavailable for a column, treating it as \"unknown\", which is correct for the non-vectorized engines, but incorrect for vector engines where missing capabilities means that the column doesn't exist and so is definitely nulls, which are always represented with a single value dimension selector.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue and adds additional javadoc and comments to try to help avoid making this mistake. Longer term, it might be wise to consider moving aggregator factorize methods to using the `ColumnProcessors` factories, so that we can re-use the same code for deciding what type of aggregators to make for a given input, but I did not do this in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nTo help prevent the metadata store from growing unbounded, enable kill unused segments by default on all datasources.\r\n\r\nThis is helpful when users have auto-compaction running or they age out data. The old segments are marked as unused but live on in the metadata store and in deep storage.\r\n\r\nThe new defaults should kill all unused segments older than 90 days. If users do not want this behavior on an upgrade, they should explicitly disable the behavior, or change the specific datasources they would want to run on.\r\n\r\n`killAllDataSources` is removed and is no longer respected. This means users who are upgrading with kill.on set to true, but `killAllDataSources` set to false AND `killDataSourceWhitelist` set to empty, will start to see unused segments older than 90 days being killed after an upgrade that were not being deleted before the upgrade. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a reasonable risk - since it is a strange combination to have kill enabled via kill.on, but then disabled killing all datasources as described above. Based on this I think this is a reasonable thing to call out in the release notes to give operators a heads up of this edge case, since killing segments deletes them from deep storage as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a new flag for ingestion to preserve existing metrics\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new flag in the tuningSpec as part of the AppendableIndexSpec. When set to true, ingestion will do the following for each given metric in the metricSpec depending on the existing state of the segment:\r\n- The segment does not have the metric name defined in metricSpec as any of it’s metric → the metric aggregator in metricSpec is applied if the source column exist otherwise the metric value is null\r\n- The segment has the metric name defined in metricSpec as one of it’s metric → the metric aggregator in metricSpec is skipped and the existing metric is unchanged\r\n\r\nUser shouldn’t need to set this directly and will automatically be set by the auto compaction.\r\n\r\nNote on some edge cases / sad path:\r\n- If non-rolled up rows has columns with the same name as aggregators in metric spec (after rolling up) and isPreserveExistingMetrics is enabled, then those non-rolled up columns would be treated as metrics and preserved (we wont compute the metric again from the source column for those rows).\r\n- Compaction task will fail if isPreserveExistingMetrics is enabled and there are rows with conflicting types in the same segment that cannot be aggregated. For example, we have String and Number in column foo, or Number in column sum_foo and String in column foo....and we have LongSum Aggregator with fieldName=foo and output=sum_foo. \r\n- Compaction task will still succeed when isPreserveExistingMetrics is enabled and there are rows with conflicting types across different segments that cannot be aggregated. For example, we have String in column foo of segment A and Number in column foo of segment B....and we have LongSum Aggregator with fieldName=foo and output=sum_foo. The combining agg will ignore the incorrect type and ingestion would succeed. This is also the same as current behavior without the preserve existing metrics flag. This PR (and the flag isPreserveExistingMetrics) does not modify anything regarding combining metrics across intermediate segments. Hence, this is the same behavior as current ingestion without the isPreserveExistingMetrics.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-21T09:07:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:31:36Z","closed_at":"2022-04-08T18:02:02Z","merged_at":"2022-04-08T18:02:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"8edea5a82dfdb34c3177c0efd7a79bae54751ab8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nFixed a bug, where HttpRemoteTaksRunner.stop could clobber HttpRemoteTaskRunner.start, and cause the overlord leader to have worker execs and other execs shutdown, and unable to assign tasks to workers. This required adding a call to exitStop() in the stop() method of the class, in a finally block. The worker holders  and node listener are now stopped when HttpRemoteTaskRunner is stopped as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default value of the property `druid.sql.planner.useGroupingSetForExactDistinct` from `false` to `true` in the config files, so that newer installations have this property as `true`, while the default still remains as `false`. \r\n\r\nThe flag determines how queries which contain an aggregation over `DISTINCT` like `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT foo.dim1) FILTER(WHERE foo.cnt = 1), SUM(foo.cnt) FROM druid.foo` get planned by Calcite. With the flag being set to false, it plans it via joins, whereas with it being set to true, the query is set using grouping sets. \r\n\r\nThere is an issue with the Calcite library https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7953, that generates a null pointer exception when planning the above-mentioned SQL statement (one which contains both DISTINCT aggregation as well as FILTER) through joins. There is no such issue when planning it via grouping sets. Therefore it is more preferrable to use the config with the value set to true than false. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Overview and benefits\r\n\r\nThis introduces a `tree` to the `flattenSpec` which allows faster JSON parsing than `jq` and `path` parsing types in the event that a simple hierarchical lookup is required.\r\n\r\nFor one of our high-volume ingestion tasks, this reduces middle manager CPU load by 25%. This task presently has 3 `root` fields and 8 additional `path` fields of the form \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"path\",\r\n  \"name\": \"task_detail\",\r\n  \"expr\": \"$.metadata.detail\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplacing this with a hierarchical lookup as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"tree\",\r\n  \"name\": \"task_detail\",\r\n  \"exprs\": [\"metadata\", \"detail\"]\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this sample, a switch to the new `tree` spec is submitted at 15.54, and after a moment or two the CPU shifts down at a notably lower total utilization from 3 cores to 2.3 cores.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3196528/150242320-61fedc3d-3c1f-419d-a6b6-273cc47658a8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation decision\r\n\r\nThe goal is to introduce the ability to (1) provide a list of expressions instead of a single expression, and, a new `tree` type. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"tree\",                     <-- new type\r\n  \"name\": \"task_detail\",\r\n  \"exprs\": [\"metadata\", \"detail\"]     <-- name of json keys to traverse as a List<String>\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe crux of the change is this tree extractor for loop (below) and the requisite parser configuration to ensure it is called.\r\n```\r\npublic Function<JsonNode, Object> makeJsonTreeExtractor(final List<String> exprs)\r\n{\r\n  String[] exprsArray = exprs.toArray(new String[0]);\r\n  return node -> {\r\n    JsonNode target = node;\r\n    for (String expr : exprsArray) {\r\n      target = target.get(expr);\r\n      if (target == null) {\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return valueConversionFunction(target);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey consideration was to avoid any backwards compatibility issues with deployments, so I opted for using a separate `exprs` parameter rather than overload the `expr` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Changes required\r\n\r\nThe change adds enum entries, the required field spec to parse `List<String> exprs` to configuration, and validate that `exprs` is only provided for the `tree` type.\r\n\r\nThen, tie it all into the `ObjectFlatteners` and `JSONFlattenerMaker` with a new `makeJsonTreeExtractor` that iterates each of the keys as a hierarchy in the dataset.\r\n\r\n#### Supporting changes\r\n\r\n- Update a lot of tests to explicitly verify the parameters are loaded.\r\n- Update `docs/ingestion-data-formats.md` to include a description of the `tree` type and the `exprs` parameter.\r\n- Update Avro, Orc, and Parquet flatteners to acknowledge `tree` but only work with a depth of 1; (would welcome guidance here).\r\n- Added benchmarks to `FlattenJSONBenchmark` to confirm improvements in flattener layer\r\n\r\n### Additional supporting data\r\n\r\nOn flamegraphs, `Flattener` related code before the change makes up ~49% of the `task-runner-xx` threads utilisation; after the change only ~16% of the `task-runner-xx` thread is used running `Flattener` related code.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] N/A added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] N/A added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test

Description\r\n\r\nFixed an issue where the provisionerService which can be used to spawn resources as needed is left running on a non-leader coordinator/overlord, after it is removed from leadership. Provisioning should only be done by the leader. To fix the issue, a call to stop the provisionerService was added to the stop() method of HttpRemoteTaskRunner class. The provisionerService was properly closed on other TaskRunner types.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the IT test fails to create datasource for some reason, we fail to see the original cause. This is because `getSegmentsInterval` is throwing an exception of its own for missing datasources. \r\n\r\nUpdate - @kfaraz pointed out a valid flow in my understanding. If there is an exception being suppressed, JVM will still log it. Since there is no such suppressed exception, it likely means that the test passed but unloading still fails. \r\n\r\nUpdate - 17th Feb\r\nThe original PR was about silencing an exception in data-source unloader. After some digging, I found the actual problem is in the test case itself. \r\nSo this is the flow in `getLockedIntervals` test\r\n- submit an ingestion task (But don't wait for the data to load)\r\n- wait for the intervals to be locked and verify (test keeps polling the lockedIntervals API in a loop)\r\n- wait for all the tasks to complete\r\n- unload the datasource in a finally block\r\nnow what is likely happening is that segments are not loaded yet after the ingestion task is finished. so the serverInventory in coordinator doesn't know yet about the datasource. This causes an exception while unloading the datasource since coordinator doesn't know about it yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-19T12:50:25Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:34:03Z","closed_at":"2022-02-17T06:38:47Z","merged_at":"2022-02-17T06:38:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"575874705f8138e002ec9ade3400f93e4d59fcfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45/labels","id":7818158,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Ad0uu","number":45,"title":"0.23.0","description":"Druid

workaround introduced in  #12158.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn #12158 the fix to workaround an issue with forbiddenapis parsing a missing signature in later Guava versions (actualy it is two of them) was to enable a now-deprecated maven plugin setting: `<failOnUnresolvableSignatures>false</failOnUnresolvableSignatures>`\r\n\r\nThis flag is very risky as it ignores signatures with typos in it. This was made as a workaround for subprojects where some dependencies are missing, but birngs the risk of not cathcing bugs because of typos.\r\n\r\nIn forbiddenapis 3.1 / 3.2 a new setting was added `ignoreSignaturesOfMissingClasses=true`, as this still prevents typos in signatures and just ignores those where the class is not existent. It then also prints no warnings anymore!\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that in case of Guava, which uses a newer version of Guava in telemetry-emitter, a deprecated method was removed, so it triggers \"class found, but method missing\".\r\n\r\nThe \"correct\" fix for those issues is to use separate signatures files per dependency and only load them in sub-projects when the dependency is used. For guava there should be 2 separate files. Unfortunately Maven is a bit limited, as you cannot make the signatures file names dynamic based on dependency versions. Lucene has gone this approach (we have a set of files per dependency) and based on the Maven coordinates our Gradle build script enables them.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I used a hack, which requires a bit copypaste, because you can't modify configurations of plugin, just replace (default) or add new list items, but not remove them:\r\n- a new signatures file was added: `guava16-forbidden-apis.txt`\r\n- it is enabled by default in parent POM\r\n- for telemetry-emitters the signatures files property is duplicated, with the above file removed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

fixes a bug that causes TaskClient in overlord to continuously retry to pause tasks. This can happen when a task is not responding to the pause command.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This PR and the description was originally written while keeping PARTITION BY and CLUSTER BY clauses in mind. The changes might not be reflected in the description and the comments.**\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add parser changes for supporting `PARTITIONED BY` and `CLUSTERED BY` as proposed in the issue https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11929. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds the ability to execute the queries of the form\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO druid.dst SELECT * FROM druid.foo PARTITION BY 'day' CLUSTER BY 1, 2\r\n```\r\nSince `PARTITION BY` and `CLUSTER BY` are non-standard SQL keywords whose support is not provided in Apache Calcite (which is used for parsing the SQL queries), some changes are made into the `pom.xml` of `druid-sql` to accommodate for the changes made to the parser. \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nCalcite is a general-purpose library, and while it does support parsing of SQL that should cover most of the dialects of SQL, one can also provide one's own SQL parser to it, to parse custom SQL statements. \r\n\r\n#### Pre Read\r\n(This is my current understanding and might have some flaws in it, please feel free to point out where I am wrong)\r\n\r\n**Provision in Calcite for extending the grammar**\r\nCalcite provides the option of setting the parser factory in `SqlParser.Config` which could be anything that implements `SqlParserImplFactory`. Therefore as far as Calcite is concerned one can rewrite the whole SQL parser from scratch in Java and can pass it to the SqlParser.Config (which is not ideal and tedious). Following is the minimalistic code snippet which achieves the same:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  static final SqlParser.Config PARSER_CONFIG = SqlParser\r\n      .configBuilder()\r\n      .setParserFactory(new CustomImplementationExtendingSqlParserImplFactory()) // Custom sql parser factory\r\n      .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor providing the default parser, Calcite uses JavaCC, which is a parser generator (`Parser.jj`) to specify the grammar in [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form), which gets compiled to a Java class. Ideally, we would like to add or extend our custom grammar production rules in this `Parser.jj`. Luckily, Calcite does support extending this Parser.jj via the use of Apache FreeMarker (FTL) templates. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in a nutshell, we would like to recompile the default parser by providing our custom rules (through template), and then pass it to the `SqlParser.Config`.\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n1. We don’t want to copy-paste Calcite’s `Parser.jj` manually and modify it directly. This is because a lot of changes do happen in Calcite's main branch, and we would ideally want to keep in line with those changes without having to copy and merge the `Parser.jj` from upstream every time. Therefore we want to reuse templates as much as possible. \r\n2. Automate the whole process of templating and compiling, so that it gets incorporated into the build process.\r\n3. Original SQL functionality shouldn't be affected. \r\n\r\n#### Modifications to the POM\r\nThe stages added to the build process look a lot similar to the one used by the project: [dask-sql](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-sql) which also extends the grammar for its own purpose. Therefore, we can use other \"druidesque\" methods/plugins to achieve the following, but the overall steps remain the same:\r\n1. Copy the resources to `target/codegen` directory.\r\n    a. Copy the default `Parser.jj` from Calcite’s jar, to the build directory\r\n    b. Copy our FTL files, which contains our custom rules, and `config.fmpp` files, which contain the information to be plugged in to the parser.\r\n2. Generate consolidated `Parser.jj` which contains the default Calcite's Parser.jj along with our custom rules, using fmpp plugin\r\n3. With the above file as input, and using JavaCC plugin create the custom parser implementation `DruidSqlParserImpl.java`. This implementation would be passed to the SqlConfig for parsing the SQL strings.\r\n\r\n#### Production Grammar added\r\n```\r\n/*\r\ncustomInsert() -> insert() [PARTITION BY stringLiteral()] [CLUSTER BY clusterItems()]\r\nclusterItems() -> (similar to what can be added in front of an ORDER BY clause in a SELECT statement)\r\n*/\r\nSqlNode DruidSqlInsert() :\r\n{\r\n    insertNode = SqlInsert()\r\n    [\r\n      <PARTITION> <BY>\r\n      partitionBy = StringLiteral()\r\n    ]\r\n    [\r\n      <CLUSTER> <BY>\r\n      clusterBy = ClusterItems()\r\n    ]\r\n    {\r\n  if(partitionBy == null && clusterBy == null) {\r\n    return insertNode;\r\n  }\r\n  if(!(insertNode instanceof SqlInsert)) {\r\n    return insertNode;\r\n  }\r\n  SqlInsert sqlInsert = (SqlInsert) insertNode;\r\n  return new DruidSqlInsert(sqlInsert, partitionBy, clusterBy);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Class Design\r\nFor the custom insert statement, we are creating a class `DruidSqlInsert`, which inherits from the `SqlInsert`. The custom class contains the extra information (like the clause attached to the PartitionBy) while passing the information from the main INSERT node to the parent.\r\nTherefore from the custom class, we can extract the extra information as and when required, while passing the same object down for the further conversion to Rel/DruidRel objects. (NOTE: Those objects however won't have any knowledge of these extra clauses added, that would be manually plugged). \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Integration with the DruidPlanner\r\n1. Once the `String` gets parsed as a SqlNode, we get an instance of `DruidSqlInsert` (if the statement is an INSERT statement with either of the PARTITION BY or CLUSTER BY clauses. \r\n2. After performing some validation, (e.g. SELECT query inside the INSERT (with a CLUSTER BY) should not have an ORDER BY clause, we extract the information passed to the CLUSTER BY.\r\n3. In the SELECT query, we add the information passed to the CLUSTER BY, as its ORDER BY. \r\n\r\n#### Caveats to the Design\r\n(Most of the following arise due to how we are extending Apache Calcite's grammar, and the limited number of regions we can actually make the changes).\r\n\r\n1. The biggest caveat to the approach is that, in the Calcite's grammar: [LINK](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html)  we are NOT extending the `INSERT` production rule. Instead, we are extending the top-level `statement` production rule to look like:\r\n```\r\nstatement:\r\n      customInsertStatement\r\n  |   resetStatement\r\n  ....\r\n  |   insert\r\n  |   update\r\n```\r\nThis is because in the original Parser.jj, there is a limited number of places wherein we can insert our custom statements. \r\nThe direct implication of this is that `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR SELECT * FROM druid.foo CLUSTER BY dim1` doesn't work, since there is no `customExplainStatement` or its equivalent. To make this work, we would have to add our own custom EXPLAIN rule as well. \r\n\r\n2. As a direct consequence of the above, `customInsertStatement` actually overshadows the `insert` statement. That is any statement that begins with `INSERT` is going to be interpreted as `customInsertStatement`, irrespective of whether it uses custom clauses or not. Therefore, we have to account for simple `insert` statements with our custom rule. \r\n\r\n3. There is no support for our custom syntax at the `RelNode` level. Conversion from SQL string to Druid Native queries look like this: `String` -> `SqlNode` -> `RelNode` -> `DruidRel`. The custom syntax is only present till the conversion from String to SqlNode. After that, the custom parameters are extracted in the `ParsedNodes` present in `DruidPlanner`, and not sent further down to the RelNode/DruidRel's. This is because there is no rule for parsing the custom nodes in the `SqlToRelConverter.class`. This possibly implies that once the native query is created, parameters passed in say `PARTITION BY` would need to be manually injected before executing the query. \r\n\r\n4. The `CLUSTER BY` and `PARTITION BY` clauses are linked to the `INSERT` statement, as opposed to the `SELECT` statements used inside them. Therefore the query looks like `INSERT INTO dst (SELECT * FROM foo) PARTITION BY 'day' CLUSTER BY dim1` rather than `INSERT INTO dst (SELECT * FROM foo PARTITION BY 'day' CLUSTER BY dim1)`. \r\n\r\n#### Alternatives design ideas\r\n1. The most 'ideal' however unmaintainable way to achieve the same would be to copy the Parser.jj from Calcite project directly, and make the changes there. This would allow us to directly make the changes in the SqlInsert's production rule (and mitigate caveats 1 & 2). However, doing so is not [recommended](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/adapter.html#extending-the-parser). \r\n2. Instead of `DruidSqlInsert` inheriting from the `SqlInsert`, it can not do so. To make the query work, we would need to replace the query node (in ParsedNodes). The current class design ensures that no replacement of nodes is required. \r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n1. In the newer version of Calcite, there is a `default_config.fmpp` which can be used to supply the boilerplate code in `config.fmpp` (https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2167). On migrating to newer version, that file can be used to reduce the code in `config.fmpp` significantly. \r\n\r\nPS: Currently the build process is failing due to spotbugs/forbiddenapis being run on the generated parser files, and due to failing `mvn dependency:analyze` check. \r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

code, utilities, tests, and documentation for writing data to Druid using Spark.\r\n\r\nThis is the final piecemeal PR recapitulating #10920 (see #11474 and #11823 for the previous two).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis connector writes Druid segment files to deep storage, one per input Spark partition. The connector also writes the segment descriptions to the Druid metadata SQL server, at which point the normal Druid coordination process handles loading, atomic updating,  and overshadowing.\r\n\r\n#### Writing Segments\r\n\r\nEach Spark partition is assigned to an executor. For each partition, one or more `IncrementalIndex` is created and passed the rows in the source Spark partition for the index's interval. The indices are flushed to local storage while being built before being pushed to deep storage. Internally, this writer uses a two-phase commit model to push segments: if all Spark partitions are successfully written to Druid segment files on deep storage, the segment metadata is published and the Druid segment coordination process takes over. However, if one or more partitions fail, the write is aborted, the segments already written to deep storage are deleted, and control is passed back to Spark for error handling.\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n\r\n`DruidDataSourceWriter`\r\n`DruidWriterFactory`\r\n`DruidDataWriter`\r\n\r\n#### Partitioning\r\n\r\nSpark's architecture means that the source dataframe is already partitioned by the time this writer is called. By default, this writer will attempt to \"rationalize\" input segments such that all covered time intervals are contiguous and complete. This means that Druid can atomically load and overshadow the produced segments but doesn't prevent sub-optimal partitioning from passing through from Spark to Druid. To address this issue, callers can partition their dataframes themselves and pass the writer a partition map describing the partitioning scheme. The writer provides four partitioners out of the box that callers can use as well (see the [docs](docs/operations/spark.md#provided-partitioners) for more information).\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n\r\n`SegmentRationalizer`\r\n`org.apache.druid.spark.partitioners.*`\r\n\r\n#### User Interface\r\n\r\nUsers call this writer like any other Spark writer: they call `.write()` on a DataFrame, configure their writer if desired, and then call `.save()`. Like the reader introduced in #11823, there is also a more ergonomic and type-safe wrapper if desired. As always, the documentation contains a complete configuration reference with further examples.\r\n\r\nExample configuration:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval metadataProperties = Map[String, String](\r\n  \"metadata.dbType\" -> \"mysql\",\r\n  \"metadata.connectUri\" -> \"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\",\r\n  \"metadata.user\" -> \"druid\",\r\n  \"metadata.password\" -> \"diurd\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nval writerConfigs = Map[String, String] (\r\n  \"table\" -> \"dataSource\",\r\n  \"writer.version\" -> 1,\r\n  \"writer.deepStorageType\" -> \"local\",\r\n  \"writer.storageDirectory\" -> \"/mnt/druid/druid-segments/\"\r\n)\r\n\r\ndf\r\n  .write\r\n  .format(\"druid\")\r\n  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)\r\n  .options(Map[String, String](writerConfigs ++ metadataProperties))\r\n  .save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nor using the convenience wrapper:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameWriter\r\n\r\nval deepStorageConfig = new LocalDeepStorageConfig().storageDirectory(\"/mnt/druid/druid-segments/\")\r\n\r\ndf\r\n  .write\r\n  .metadataDbType(\"mysql\")\r\n  .metadataUri(\"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\")\r\n  .metadataUser(\"druid\")\r\n  .metadataPassword(\"diurd\")\r\n  .version(1)\r\n  .deepStorage(deepStorageConfig)\r\n  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)\r\n  .dataSource(\"dataSource\")\r\n  .druid()\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Because the `MoreExecutors#sameThreadExecutor()`  method is not found in the project code, it cannot be solved from the code level. It can only be solved at the Maven level. Even the latest version 3.2 of the `forbiddenapis` plugin does not support this situation yet, so simply skip this check in the new extension first to quickly fix blocker issues.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that `DiscoveryDruidNode` cannot be created while deserializing it from a JSON when there is an unknown `DruidService`. This bug can be seen when you do rolling update. Suppose you have a custom `MyDruidService` that is added in a new version, `v2`. While you are upgrading your cluster from `v1` to `v2`, other nodes who watch the node that is upgraded first and announces `MyDruidService` will not understand what `MyDruidService` is until they are upgraded to `v2`. In this case, this bug currently can fail node discovery. This PR fixes the bug by ignoring unknown `DruidServices` during deserialization of `DiscoveryDruidNode`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DiscoveryDruidNode`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

PR reverts a change made semi recently that causes potentially subtly incorrect `ColumnInspector` to be used in a `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory` in `IncrementalIndex`. The schema of the `IncrementalIndex` doesn't necessarily match the schema of the `InputRow`, which was my mistake.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the InputRow could provide its signature so that the stuff using this column selector factory could have better information, but i'll save that for another day.\r\n\r\nIt isn't immediately obvious to me the best way to add a direct test for this, will add to PR if i think of one.","created_at":"2022-01-13T22:44:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:35:50Z","closed_at":"2022-01-14T02:09:06Z","merged_at":"2022-01-14T02:09:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0c4c568cba8a149fd5ae51321ffc6e483c5d011","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug introduced in #11888 for the ARRAY type strategy write method, where the size tracking of remaining buffer space had a silly math bug that made size tracking go wildly wrong the longer the array was. I was incorrectly subtracting the total so far bytes written for the whole array, rather than only the bytes for each element written, so it \"used\" up the space far far quicker than the actual number of bytes written 😛 \r\n\r\nI added a test, which fails prior to the changes in this PR, that writes an array that is nearly the size of the test buffer to ensure that size tracking allows the full use of the buffer.\r\n\r\nI also fixed up a couple of spots that mutate buffer position in `NullableTypeStrategy` that should've been wrapped in a try..finally, so now they are.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFollow-up to #11949, this PR splits explicit time column functions into standalone `EARLIEST_BY` and `LATEST_BY` SQL functions to avoid the method signatures being ambiguous and dependent on the column types of the inputs.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, something like `latest(x, 10)` could either translate to \"latest\" value of x with max bytes of 10 if a string, but if x was a number it would treat the `10` as a timestamp, so instead of a validation exception like would happen prior to #11949, it would allow it but then explode with strange cast exceptions due to unintended behavior on the users part.\r\n\r\nSplitting this out into separate functions makes it much less likely for the user to issue the incorrect query.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the ClientQuerySegmentWalker, when the data sources get inlined, they can be limited by the number of rows to prevent a query (subquery) from hogging up the broker's memory. This however doesn't have a proper correspondence with the memory used, since a row can have multiple columns with varying amounts of data in them. Therefore it would be better if there is a memory limit also available, which prevents the subquery's results from exploding beyond a certain memory limit. \r\nThis PR aims to add the initial structure for limiting the subqueries by the memory limit, and an initial implementation of estimating the memory of the inlined results.\r\nAnother alternative, apart from estimating the final memory result consumption was to calculate the gathered bytes from historicals, and then limit based on that, however that seems far off the mark, considering that the subqueries can increase or decrease in size in the broker before getting materialized.\r\n\r\nEstimating the size of the result in the memory is derived similarly to the implementations of `DimensionIndexers`.\r\n\r\nIn case that the memory limit does get exceeded, it raises a `ResourceException`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ClientQuerySegmentWalker`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Druid batch ingestion replace high level design\r\nThis PR adds tombstones to Druid in order  to support complete replace semantics. It supports tombstones for primary partitioning and all forms of secondary partitioning (dynamic/linear, hash and range).\r\n\r\n## Current known limitations (as of March  1, 2022)\r\nThe intention is to merge with the current limitations but to remove them in future releases.\r\n\r\n### The broker is filtering out tombstones from its timeline. \r\nThis is a limitation that can be fixed in this PR or leave as future work. The consequence of this is that metadata queries will not consider tombstones. In the extreme case where a datasource's visible segments are all tombstones (i.e. the datasource is practically empty) then queries will fail with an exception. Future work can address this by enabling metadata queries for tombstones or some other means.\r\n\r\n### Metadata queries will not reflect metadata in tombstones\r\nThis is a consequence of the fact that brokers are filtering out tombstones. This will be fixed in a future patch.\r\n\r\n### `SEGMENT` locking is not supported\r\nReplace will force `SEGMENT` locking to use `TIME_CHUNK` locking (a log message will be emitted in the  task log. Future work can address this.\r\n\r\n### Cleanup of tombstones\r\nIf all the segments are being completely overshadowed by tombstones and the overshadowed segments are all marked as not used then the tombstones can be removed. From a cleanup perspective tombstones are the same as regular segments so the general cleanup process should suffice for tombstones as well (i.e. `KillUnusedSegments` coordinator duty will clean them up.)\r\n\r\n### Tombstone remains after append\r\nIf data is appended to an interval with a tombstone the tombstone remains and new data segments are appended. No query issues have been observed.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade/Downgrade process\r\n\r\n### Upgrade\r\nThe `dropExisting` flag is being reused for tombstones since tombstones subsume the previous semantics but without the race conditions inherent in the original implementation. This should be fine. If there is a task executing with that flag set while an upgrade is going on, since the tombstones (or dropping segments) are all executed in the main task (single task in sequential, supervisor in parallel ingestion), the outcome depends on which code the main task was in. If main task was still in the \"old\" code (because of a rolling upgrade) then existing segments will be dropped (which is fine since that's what the user wanted and the drop APIs are still in the code). If it is new code, then tombstones will be created which will also meet the expectations since tombstones subsume dropping segments.\r\n\r\n### Downgrade\r\nIf you upgrade to a version with tombstone support and you use the tombstone feature (i.e. tombstones are created) and then you want to downgrade your system should continue to work but with potential exceptions being thrown regarding the tombstones created and not recognized by previous versions. This should not make Druid stop working but will pollute the logs with the exceptions. The only way to stop those exceptions would be to manually delete the tombstones from the segments metadata table for the corresponding datasources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem statement\r\nAssume there is an existing data source that has data across its time chunks. Assume that you want to replace data for this data source from time `t1` to time `t2` where `t2` > `t1`. Assume that the some of the replacement time chunks generated by the input data set and its ingestion spec will not have any data. Also assume that the original data set contained data for some of those replacement time chunks. Then the original intervals for those replacement time chunks will not be \"replaced, they will keep their data in the original data source. Thus the end result is that today it is not possible to support the intended semantics of a \"replace\" functionality. This design is intended to make the necessary changes to Druid to support replace semantics for data.\r\n\r\nThe following example may help clarify the problem.\r\n\r\n### Example of today functionality\r\nAssume we have the following data set (with `DAY` segment granularity):\r\n\r\n| time | country | issues |\r\n|------|---------|--------|\r\n|4/1/20|China|3|\r\n|4/1/20|Russia|4|\r\n|4/1/20|USA|2|\r\n|4/2/20|China|8|\r\n|4/2/20|China|10|\r\n|4/2/20|China|12|\r\n|4/3/20|USA|8|\r\n|4/3/20|Russia|14|\r\n|4/3/20|France|20|\r\n\r\nNow assume we re-ingested same data/segment granularity as above but with a [filter](country-filter-s.json) removing all countries that have \"China\" as their value. If we do this we may expect all rows with \"China\" to be removed from our data set. However this is what we get:\r\n\r\n| time | country | issues |\r\n|------|---------|--------|\r\n|4/1/20|Russia|4|\r\n|4/1/20|USA|2|\r\n|4/2/20|China|8|\r\n|4/2/20|China|10|\r\n|4/2/20|China|12|\r\n|4/3/20|USA|8|\r\n|4/3/20|Russia|14|\r\n|4/3/20|France|20|\r\n\r\nOnly the first row with country \"China\" was removed! This is consistent with today's design but it may be surprising especially for new Druid users. What is going on is that the filter is removing (i.e. 'throw away\" in Druid ingestion terminology) all rows with country values \"China\" so there is no ingestion data for the existing segment for DAY `4/2/20` (i.e. a DAY \"time chunk\")  and therefore the original segment for that time-chunk remains in the data source.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a concept of \"replace with nothing\". In many databases this is called a \"tombstone\". What we need is a functionality that we need to tell Druid in batch ingest: \"please replace all time chunks in this interval even if there is no data for them.\". This is what this feature is all about.\r\n\r\nAssuming that we have changed Druid to have the replace functionality using tombstones and assume also that the existing flag `dropExisting` has been redefined to support it. So given that we have this functionality, all we have to do with the above [re-ingest spec](country-filter-s.json) is to set the parameter `dropExisting` to `true` and expect to get the new data:\r\n\r\n| time | country | issues |\r\n|------|---------|--------|\r\n|4/1/20|Russia|4|\r\n|4/1/20|USA|2|\r\n|4/3/20|USA|8|\r\n|4/3/20|Russia|14|\r\n|4/3/20|France|20|\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details & design idea\r\n\r\nA *replace batch ingestion spec* (or simply *replace spec*) is a batch ingestion spec with the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n- Input data (the usual stuff)\r\n\r\n- Batch ingestion intervals in the ioConfig section of the spec (the usual stuff) (we call this the \"replace intervals\")\r\n\r\n- A flag in the ioConfig (reuse `dropExisting`) that indicates that this is replace of time chunks (this is a new behavior for an existing flag supporting similar but not quite exactly the same behavior using a different implementation) \r\n\r\nThe idea is that after all sub-tasks for a particular ingestion completes and it is ready to publish the segments then, before publishing, the task identifies real segments in input intervals as well as \"empty\" intervals that should contain tombstones. The tombstones will be represented as `DataSegment` like real segments but inside its metadata they are clearly identifiable as a \"tombstone\". After this point, the tombstone segments are added to the real segments and published together by the Overlord. Then the coordinator takes over and assigns them to historicals which \"load\" tombstones (i.e. being aware that tombstones are special and are not actually stored in the file system) and announce them to the broker. The broker would then incorporate tombstones into its time line and either filtering them out when queries arrive or not filtering them out and send the queries to the historicals which know that queries in tombstone intervals should return no data.\r\n\r\nThus the following are our design goals:\r\n- Tombstones will be integrated as close as possible to current functionality. Tombstones are represented with `DataSegment` (but with no backing file in deep storage or in local segment caches) and should be transparent to most of the existing code\r\n- Changes to Druid thus will be the minimal required to keep existing functionality working (i.e. no backward incompatible changes introduced) and make the new replace functionality with tombstones work\r\n- Performance would be minimally impacted\r\n\r\n## Components and their corresponding changes\r\n\r\n### Middlemanager/peon (create, push tombstones, publish to overlord)\r\n- Using the input intervals & the segment granularity for the replace ingestion, identify the time chunks intervals for the ingestion\r\n- Subtract from those the ones that are not empty: i.e. any time chunk that overlaps with a segment produced by the replace spec that has data. Note that the segments produced by the ingestion are still not published and are different from any existing, used, segment for the data source.\r\n- Technically, after the step above we have the intervals that can be used to create the tombstones. In reality we don't need to create tombstones for them all. We just need to create tombstones for those tombstone intervals that \"overlap\" with existing, used, segments with an immediately older version (i.e. current segments). So from the intervals above also remove those intervals that do not overlap with any current, used, visible, segment. \r\n- Now we have the \"tombstone intervals\"\r\n- For each of these tombstone intervals create a `DataSegment` with `shardSpec` of a new type `TombstoneShardSpec`. Call these `DataSegments` tombstones . The `DataSegments` for tombstones are created using  versions from the `TIME-CHUNK` locks, thus `SEGMENT` locking is not supported. To minimize coordinator issues we gave tombstones a size of 1.\r\n- After all the tombstones are created, add these segments to the regular new segments that were created for the ingestion in progress\r\n- Then publish all the augmented set of `DataSegments` as usual\r\n- As usual, publishing by the overlord  guarantees that all those data segments are inserted in the metadata (this is current normal behavior for publishing segments)\r\n- Replace will only work with ingestion specs that provide input intervals in their `GranularitySpec`. If `dropExisting` is set to true with an ingestion spec with no input intervals then the ingestion spec is immediately rejected with an error.\r\n- Replace will force `SEGMENT` locking to use `TIME_CHUNK` locking (a log message will be emitted in the  task log.\r\n\r\n### Coordinator \r\n - Assignment: The coordinator by means of the load rules detects that new segments exist for the data source. The new segments may contain tombstones, the coordinator does not care about this and uses its usual assignment strategy to assign the data source’s segments (some of them are tombstones) to historically. \r\n\r\n- The only potential change in the coordinator may be having an assignment strategy for tombstones so that they all do not end up in the same historical but this may be left for future work.\r\n\r\n### Historical query path\r\n- The historical detects that a new segment has been assigned to it. If the segment is a tombstone then the historical creates an empty `QueriableIndex` marked as “tombstone” (using a new `QueriableIndex`  method: `boolean isFromTombstone()`) and announces the tombstone\r\n- If the historical receives a query for the data source, the historical’s ServerManager detects the tombstone queryable indices (using the “isFromTombstone” method) and for each of those tombstones it creates a `NoOpQueryRunner` (this is an existing query runner that always returns an empty result set, exactly what is needed for tombstones). Thus the part of the query hitting a tombstone queryable index will return an empty sequence since that is how the `NoOpQueryRunner` works and it is the expected result set from a tombstone since tombstones do not have any rows.\r\n\r\n### Broker\r\n- The broker will add the tombstones announced by the historicals like any other segment that has been announced. However the broker needs to be aware of those segments that are tombstones so the segments need to be marked as tombstones whenever appropriate. The broker will avoid processing tombstones after they are incorporated in its timeline since tombstones are not useful in queries because they will not return any data for any query. The broker accomplishes this by filtering out by creating a special `VersionedIntervalTimeline` that avoids them in its `lookup` interval method.\r\n\r\n### Compaction:\r\n- The compaction task will traverse the used segments for a data source and it will simply skip those segments that are not tombstones since they will have no data. The previous tombstones might be overshadowed depending on the new compaction granularity or depending on whether there was data appended to the tombstone time chunk after the initial tombstone creation (in the latter case the appended data since it is in the same time chunk will completely overshadow the exiting tombstone). Overshadowed tombstones will be processed exactly as normal data segments after this.\r\n\r\n### Cleaning tombstone datasegments\r\n- Since tombstones are `DataSegment`s in the segment metadata Druid table they are candidates for overshadowing, being marked `unused`, etc. like any other `DataSegment`. Initially we will leave it to Druid to clean them up the same as non-tombstone segments. If needed, in the future we may add more aggressive cleanup mechanisms for tombstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Design alternatives\r\n\r\nProbably the first idea that comes to mind instead of tombstones is simply dropping existing segments when replace is desired. This was actually already tried and implemented ([PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11025)). However as you can see in the discussion that functionality is currently marked as \"experimental\" due to a race condition between dropping and loading segments that may make data temporarily unavailable. Besides dropping segments by itself is not enough to support the full replace functionality. For instance when replacement data using finer granularity may not be always possible to drop the existing, coarser, segment (the replace PR has an example in one of the comments). So dropping segments is more like a subset of replace use cases therefore the new replace functionality discussed in this document subsumes the current `dropExisting` functionality but eliminating the race condition.\r\n\r\nWe also considered variations of assigning, announcing and processing queries for datasources with tombstones. The tombstone creation was pretty stable and we feel strongly that using `DataSegment` to represent tombstones and the normal publishing process works well. For the assigning & announcement we considered having the coordinator announcing them and the broker incorporating them into its timeline. We discarded this option though using the reasoning to stick with the current design as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Implementation status\r\n### As of Feb 15, 2022\r\nFunctionality is restricted to `TIME_CHUNK` locking and tombstone versions are obtained from the lock's versions. A new `shardSpec`, `TombstoneShardSpec` is introduced. \r\n\r\n### As of Feb 12, 2022\r\nSegment locking is now allowed for all forms of secondary partitioning. Tombstone allocation is done using the corresponding allocators normally used in the particular code flow where tombstones are created.\r\n\r\n### As of Feb 1, 2022\r\n\r\nAll functionality as designed has been implemented with the following potential exceptions. The [PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12137) build is green. All existing tests for the similar `dropExisting` flag have been kept and refactored to match `replace` semantics with tombstones (`dropExisting` should continue working as is from a functional perspective even though it is now implemented as tombstone). New unit test have been added for new components introduced.\r\n\r\nThis functionality will not support segment locking. If segment locking is requested at the same time that replace is requested, timeChunk locking will be forced.\r\n\r\n## Implementation status\r\n### As of January 31, 2022\r\n\r\nAll functionality as designed has been implemented with the following potential exceptions. The [PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12137) build is green. All existing tests for the similar `dropExisting` flag have been kept and refactored to match `replace` semantics with tombstones (`dropExisting` should continue working as is from a functional perspective even though it is now implemented as tombstone). New unit test have been added for new components introduced.\r\n\r\nThe most visible potential gap at this point is lack of complete support for `SEGMENT` locking. We could prevent replace for the case of `SEGMENT` locking and leave this support for a future release or just further work on the PR to fully support segment locking.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in `FileSmoosher` when using `addWithSmooshedWriter` in \"delegated\" mode , which writes to temporary files until the \"parent\" `SmooshedWriter` is closed, in cases file names which look like valid paths, e.g. 'foo/bar'.\r\n\r\nThe added test case will explode with an error like:\r\n```\r\njava.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /var/folders/v0/zc_jt5n12d39kx7dn6xmg73w0000gn/T/junit296384917261983992/base/foo/bar/0\r\n```\r\nprior to the changes in this PR, which is now using a counter to make a temp file name, and a map of the counter value to the actual file name when merging the delegated files back into the parent file.\r\n\r\nThere are also a couple of other improvements for some future changes that I would like to make. The first is `FileSmoosher.addWithSmooshedWriter`, when _not_ delegating, now checks that it is still open when doing stuff inside of `close`, making it now be a no-op if already closed (allowing column serializers to add additional files and avoid delegated mode if they are finished writing out their own content and ned to add additional files)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `SegmentWriteOutMedium` has a new method that allows callers to free-up `WriteOutBytes` when using a shared medium and are fully in control of the lifecycle of the `WriteOutBytes`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  SegmentWriteOutMedium makeChildWriteOutMedium() throws IOException;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe contract of this method is that the child medium is registered to the closer of the parent, so need not be explicitly closed, but it also _may be_ explicitly closed, to allow freeing the backing resources of `WriteOutBytes` created by the medium. When using a shared medium, such as is done when serializing columns during segment creation, these resources are typically not able to be released until the medium itself is closed.\r\n\r\nThe type of use case this method is targeting is actually present in `IntermediateColumnarLongsSerializer`, which does not actually use the `SegmentWriteOutMedium` until `getSerializedSize`/`writeTo` is called where they are immediately written to the channel. However, there is little benefit to changing to this method, because it is a very small number of additional files that will be created when writing out each column, and so not much to gain by releasing them early. Something like #10628 however, which creates a lot of files and immediately dumps them in the channel, could greatly reduce the number of open files on the system if there were for example a very large number of columns.\r\n\r\nFinally, `OnHeapMemorySegmentWriteOutMedium` previously would never mark its `WriteOutBytes` as 'closed', meaning that callers could indefinitely write to one of these buffers even after the medium was closed. This seemed like it allows breaking the contract of `SegmentWriteOutMedium` to use `WriteOutBytes` after closed, and the underlying `ByteBufferWriteOutBytes` has methods to check that the medium is open, but the heap implementation has no way to set it as not opened. I have changed this so that all implementations of `SegmentWriteOutMedium` behave identically by pushing the `free` method down to `ByteBufferWriteOutBytes` (and overriding it in the direct implementation).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

performance of the ArrayOfDoubles Sketch operations tend to be dominated by stringifying the column used for the sketch.  This change adds a small 10-item LRU cache that allows us to skip this stringification when data is sorted by the key being used *and* also adjusts to use the `lookupUtf8Bytes` method instead to get the value when it is possible.  This has generated a significant speedup in the wild and doesn't change functionality.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nBecause the branch was deleted by me by mistake, now resubmit this pr\r\nThe previous submission is [12042](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12042)\r\nWhen we use druid for various query operations, there may be some query requests that take a long time. These query requests may be some bad query requests. If there are many such requests, it will cause a lot of pressure on druid, so we hope A metric can be added to count the number of occurrences of these query requests, and to mark these requests in the request log. So that we can analyze these queries and can make it a little easier for cluster operators to diagnose query issues better.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new query metric query/long/count  that represents the number of long queries during the emission period and request logging will mark if this request is a long query request\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x]  been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x]  added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x]  added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x]  added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for code coverage is met.","created_at":"2022-01-06T10:18:03Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T00:16:38Z","closed_at":"2023-12-09T00:16:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26747171302a7f836b295152bd9516c291e74b4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":612479291,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MTI0NzkyOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Metrics/Event%20Emitting","name":"Area

adding metrics in Auto Compaction\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `metricsSpec` to auto compaction. Note that `metricsSpec` field already exists for manual compaction task.\r\nBy setting `metricsSpec` in auto compaction, the user will be able to add new metric columns to all compacted data for the datasource.\r\n\r\nThis PR intentionally omits any documentation as this feature ('metricsSpec` for Auto compaction) is still incomplete. In the current state, it is not very useful as auto compaction will not be able to deal with segments that already has the metric (defined in the metricsSpec) or if the source dimension is dropped when compaction runs for the same (compacted) time chunk again. Basically, the only case that this feature (in current state) would be useful is if once the metrics are added, the data for the compacted time chunk does not change (no new segment appended) and that we are converting from no rollup into rollup at the time of compaction. A follow up PR will solve these problems and add guardrails for cases that can run into unexpected results (see https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12117 for more details).  \r\n\r\nNote that this PR also change one undocumented behavior of compaction task. Before this PR, any metricsSpec given to the compaction task will be converted into the combining factories. This was done to reduce human error. For example, suppose the user put a count metric in the compaction task. We assumed that what the user really want is probably counting the number of original rows before rollup instead of counting the rows after rollup and hence the combining factory for count is longSum, so we automatically convert the count aggregator to use the longSum instead. However, this prevent any new metrics to be added to the compacted data as the combining factory will only combine the existing metric and cannot create new metric. This PR removes this assumption and uses the metricsSpec provided as-is. This functionality is not documented and I believe no one is using it since you can achieve the same result by not providing the metricsSpec. \r\n\r\nThis PR is part of https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12117\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

That is, fetch each dimension directly without fetching the entire dimension array.\r\n\r\nThe modifications to `IncrementalIndex` includes:\r\n  1. Changed the `getMetric` methods to accept `IncrementalIndexRow` instead of `int rowOffset`, because `OakIncrementalIndex` does not keep a mapping from row index to an actual row.\r\nThis does not affect the other implementations' performance because in all the cases these methods are used, the caller already had an `IncrementalIndexRow` object.\r\n 1. Move `CachingColumnSelectorFactory` to `IncrementalIndex`\r\n\r\nThe modifications to `IncrementalIndexRow` allow lazy evaluation of off-heap keys, without adding an overhead to the on-heap keys case. We add/modify the following methods:\r\n  1. Changed `public Object[] getDims()` to `public Object getDim(int index)`\r\n  1. Add `public int getDimsLength()`\r\n  1. Add `public boolean isDimNull(int index)`\r\n  1. Add `public IndexedInts getIndexedDim(int index, @Nullable IndexedInts cachedIndexedInts)`\r\n\r\n`getIndexedDim()` purpose is to support a lazy-evaluation version of an indexed ints dimension instead of the array of integers that is returned by `getDim()`.\r\nThe modified implementation in `StringDimensionIndexer`, utilize this method and query using IndexedInts instead of the array. This allows our implementation (`OakIncrementalIndex`) to use the lazy-evaluation approach, while the other implementations use the existing integer array, without performance degradation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this commit\r\n * Changed:\r\n   - `IncrementalIndex`\r\n   - `IncrementalIndexRow`\r\n   - `OnheapIncrementalIndex`\r\n   - `StringDimensionIndexer`\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.
