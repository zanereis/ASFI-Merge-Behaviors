What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCloudera put `/var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process/15000-hive-HIVEMETASTORE/hive-site.xml` as the configuration file for the Hive Metastore Server, where `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql=false`. But Spark isn't reading this configuration file and get default value `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql=true`. As @mallman said, we should use `getMetaConf` method to obtain the original configuration from Hive Metastore Server.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in the python implementation of rdd cartesian product related to batching that showed up in repeated cartesian products with seemingly random results. The root cause being multiple iterators pulling from the same stream in the wrong order because of logic that ignored batching.\r\n\r\n`CartesianDeserializer` and `PairDeserializer` were changed to implement `_load_stream_without_unbatching` and borrow the one line implementation of `load_stream` from `BatchedSerializer`. The default implementation of `_load_stream_without_unbatching` was changed to give consistent results (always an iterable) so that it could be used without additional checks.\r\n\r\n`PairDeserializer` no longer extends `CartesianDeserializer` as it was not really proper. If wanted a new common super class could be added.\r\n\r\nBoth `CartesianDeserializer` and `PairDeserializer` now only extend `Serializer` (which has no `dump_stream` implementation) since they are only meant for *de*serialization.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional unit tests (sourced from #14248) plus one for testing a cartesian with zip.","created_at":"2016-12-02T15:55:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T20:25:19Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T19:10:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa4781e4cc76896a9e49ee84281cd449c2131a63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12f3ab0bdd0f19bc5ec67f5d82f1e242f870e302","head":{"label":"aray:fix-cartesian","ref":"fix-cartesian","sha":"12f3ab0bdd0f19bc5ec67f5d82f1e242f870e302","user":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35430088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQzMDA4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"aray/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aray/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs reported in the Jira, there are some weird issues with exploding Python UDFs in SparkSQL.\r\n\r\nThe following test code can reproduce it. Notice: the following test code is reported to return wrong results in the Jira. However, as I tested on master branch, it causes exception and so can't return any result.\r\n\r\n    >>> from pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\n    >>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n    >>> \r\n    >>> df = spark.range(10)\r\n    >>> \r\n    >>> def return_range(value):\r\n    ...   return [(i, str(i)) for i in range(value - 1, value + 1)]\r\n    ... \r\n    >>> range_udf = udf(return_range, ArrayType(StructType([StructField(\"integer_val\", IntegerType()),\r\n    ...                                                     StructField(\"string_val\", StringType())])))\r\n    >>> \r\n    >>> df.select(\"id\", explode(range_udf(df.id))).show()\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n      File \"/spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 318, in show\r\n        print(self._jdf.showString(n, 20))\r\n      File \"/spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.4-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1133, in __call__\r\n      File \"/spark/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 63, in deco\r\n        return f(*a, **kw)\r\n      File \"/spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.4-src.zip/py4j/protocol.py\", line 319, in get_return_value py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o126.showString.: java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed\r\n        at scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:156)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.CodegenSupport$class.consume(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:120)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.GenerateExec.consume(GenerateExec.scala:57)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue is, in `ExtractPythonUDFs` we insert `BatchEvalPythonExec` to run PythonUDFs in batch. `BatchEvalPythonExec` will add extra outputs (e.g., `pythonUDF0`) to original plan. In above case, the original `Range` only has one output `id`. After `ExtractPythonUDFs`, the added `BatchEvalPythonExec` has two outputs `id` and `pythonUDF0`.\r\n\r\nBecause the output of `GenerateExec` is given after analysis phase, in above case, it is the combination of `id`, i.e., the output of `Range`, and `col`. But in planning phase, we change `GenerateExec`'s child plan to `BatchEvalPythonExec` with additional output attributes.\r\n\r\nIt will cause no problem in non wholestage codegen. Because when evaluating the additional attributes are projected out the final output of `GenerateExec`.\r\n\r\nHowever, as `GenerateExec` now supports wholestage codegen, the framework will input all the outputs of the child plan to `GenerateExec`. Then when consuming `GenerateExec`'s output data (i.e., calling `consume`), the number of output attributes is different to the output variables in wholestage codegen.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, this patch only gives the generator's output to `GenerateExec` after analysis phase. `GenerateExec`'s output is the combination of its child plan's output and the generator's output. So when we change `GenerateExec`'s child, its output is still correct.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test cases to PySpark.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-02T15:52:09Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:08Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T01:52:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95d209a95b9f599ac4706ca187b7eb9db3c4e082","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5594f7ffcbdc9ab2e83008a99d5878fa9fae2b8","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-py-udf-with-generator","ref":"fix-py-udf-with-generator","sha":"a5594f7ffcbdc9ab2e83008a99d5878fa9fae2b8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSeveral cleanup and improvements for ```spark.logit```:\r\n* ```summary``` should return coefficients matrix, and should output labels for each class if the model is multinomial logistic regression model.\r\n* ```summary``` should not return ```areaUnderROC, roc, pr, ...```, since most of them are DataFrame which are less important for R users. Meanwhile, these metrics ignore instance weights (setting all to 1.0) which will be changed in later Spark version. In case it will introduce breaking changes, we do not expose them currently.\r\n* SparkR test improvement: comparing the training result with native R glmnet.\r\n* Remove argument ```aggregationDepth``` from ```spark.logit```, since it's an expert Param(related with Spark architecture and job execution) that would be used rarely by R users.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`input_file_name` doesn't return filename when working with UDF in PySpark. An example shows the problem:\r\n\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\n    from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\n    def filename(path):\r\n        return path\r\n\r\n    sourceFile = udf(filename, StringType())\r\n    spark.read.json(\"tmp.json\").select(sourceFile(input_file_name())).show()\r\n\r\n    +---------------------------+\r\n    |filename(input_file_name())|\r\n    +---------------------------+\r\n    |                           |\r\n    +---------------------------+    \r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue is, we group rows in `BatchEvalPythonExec` for batching processing of PythonUDF. Currently we group rows first and then evaluate expressions on the rows. If the data is less than the required number of rows for a group, the iterator will be consumed to the end before the evaluation. However, once the iterator reaches the end, we will unset input filename. So the input_file_name expression can't return correct filename.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the approach to group the batch of rows. We evaluate the expression first and then group evaluated results to batch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test to PySpark.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is to make input rates in timeline more flat for spark streaming + kinesis.\r\nSince kinesis workers fetch records and push them into block generators in bulk, timeline in web UI has many spikes when `maxRates` applied (See a Figure.1 below). This fix splits fetched input records into multiple `adRecords` calls.\r\n\r\nFigure.1 Apply `maxRates=500` in vanilla Spark\r\n<img width=\"1084\" alt=\"apply_limit in_vanilla_spark\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHere are the major changes in this PR. \r\n- Added the ability to recover `StreamingQuery.id` from checkpoint location, by writing the id to `checkpointLoc/metadata`.\r\n- Added `StreamingQuery.runId` which is unique for every query started and does not persist across restarts. This is to identify each restart of a query separately (same as earlier behavior of `id`).\r\n- Removed auto-generation of `StreamingQuery.name`. The purpose of name was to have the ability to define an identifier across restarts, but since id is precisely that, there is no need for a auto-generated name. This means name becomes purely cosmetic, and is null by default.\r\n- Added `runId` to `StreamingQueryListener` events and `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\nImplementation details\r\n- Renamed existing `StreamExecutionMetadata` to `OffsetSeqMetadata`, and moved it to the file `OffsetSeq.scala`, because that is what this metadata is tied to. Also did some refactoring to make the code cleaner (got rid of a lot of `.json` and `.getOrElse(\"{}\")`).\r\n- Added the `id` as the new `StreamMetadata`. \r\n- When a StreamingQuery is created it gets or writes the `StreamMetadata` from `checkpointLoc/metadata`.\r\n- All internal logging in `StreamExecution` uses `(name, id, runId)` instead of just `name`\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [x] Test handling of name=null in json generation of StreamingQueryProgress\r\n- [x] Test handling of name=null in json generation of StreamingQueryListener events\r\n- [x] Test python API of runId\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated unit tests and new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1 ListingFileCatalog was significantly refactored (and renamed to InMemoryFileIndex). This introduced a regression where parallelism could only be introduced at the very top of the tree. However, in many cases (e.g. `spark.read.parquet(topLevelDir)`), the top of the tree is only a single directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies and fixes the parallel recursive listing code to allow parallelism to be introduced at any level during recursive descent (though note that once we decide to list a sub-tree in parallel, the sub-tree is listed in serial on executors).\r\n\r\ncc @mallman  @cloud-fan \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nChecked metrics in unit tests.","created_at":"2016-12-02T02:44:25Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T13:02:30Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T13:02:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ba8baf342ada09348f42953daa0cc73a3e53a43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db664396b3892de45507d9c82eed7d070bdd82dc","head":{"label":"ericl:spark-18679","ref":"spark-18679","sha":"db664396b3892de45507d9c82eed7d070bdd82dc","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### This PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15975 to Branch 2.1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following two `DataFrameReader` JDBC APIs ignore the user-specified parameters of parallelism degree.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n  def jdbc(\r\n      url: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      columnName: String,\r\n      lowerBound: Long,\r\n      upperBound: Long,\r\n      numPartitions: Int,\r\n      connectionProperties: Properties): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n  def jdbc(\r\n      url: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      predicates: Array[String],\r\n      connectionProperties: Properties): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issues. To verify the behavior correctness, we improve the plan output of `EXPLAIN` command by adding `numPartitions` in the `JDBCRelation` node.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Scan JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [NAME#1896,THEID#1897] ReadSchema: struct<NAME:string,THEID:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Scan JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [numPartitions=3] [NAME#1896,THEID#1897] ReadSchema: struct<NAME:string,THEID:int>\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the verification logics on all the test cases for JDBC concurrent fetching.","created_at":"2016-12-01T23:52:30Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T03:16:47Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T03:16:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8cc46136a3e2c2771a921a34f359206cd2164c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/170568dc78f9cbe911306375f97d4b6bf141304b","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:jdbcFix2.1","ref":"jdbcFix2.1","sha":"170568dc78f9cbe911306375f97d4b6bf141304b","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

push-down for string columns. This PR disables filter push-down for both string and binary columns to work around this issue. Binary columns are also affected because some Parquet data models (like Hive) may store string columns as a plain Parquet `binary` instead of a `binary (UTF8)`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore hive 1.1, when inserting into a table, hive will create the staging directory under a common scratch directory. After the writing is finished, hive will simply empty the table directory and move the staging directory to it.\r\n\r\nAfter hive 1.1, hive will create the staging directory under the table directory, and when moving staging directory to table directory, hive will still empty the table directory, but will exclude the staging directory there.\r\n\r\nIn `InsertIntoHiveTable`, we simply copy the code from hive 1.2, which means we will always create the staging directory under the table directory, no matter what the hive version is. This causes problems if the hive version is prior to 1.1, because the staging directory will be removed by hive when hive is trying to empty the table directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR copies the code from hive 0.13, so that we have 2 branches to create staging directory.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems some APIs such as `PairRDDFunctions.saveAsHadoopDataset()` do not close the record writer before issuing the commit for the task.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, the output in the temp directory is being open and output committer tries to rename it from temp directory to the output directory after finishing writing. \r\n\r\nSo, it fails to move the file. It seems we should close the writer actually before committing the task like the other writers such as `FileFormatWriter`.\r\n\r\nIdentified failure was as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAILURE! - in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo bugs are addressed here\r\n1. INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sometime crashed when catalog partition management was enabled. This was because when dropping partitions after an overwrite operation, the Hive client will attempt to delete the partition files. If the entire partition directory was dropped, this would fail. The PR fixes this by adding a flag to control whether the Hive client should attempt to delete files.\r\n2. The static partition spec for OVERWRITE TABLE was not correctly resolved to the case-sensitive original partition names. This resulted in the entire table being overwritten if you did not correctly capitalize your partition names.\r\n\r\ncc @yhuai @cloud-fan \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. Surprisingly, the existing overwrite table tests did not catch these edge cases.","created_at":"2016-11-30T22:04:24Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T14:01:41Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T14:01:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53938aff3e1269b6a5553cc7607b97120b4f4191","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a9f9710b7e0618d2e90d846be791ab80ea76883f","head":{"label":"ericl:spark-18659","ref":"spark-18659","sha":"a9f9710b7e0618d2e90d846be791ab80ea76883f","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1, we make Hive serde tables case-preserving by putting the table metadata in table properties, like what we did for data source table. However, we should not put table provider, as it will break forward compatibility. e.g. if we create a Hive serde table with Spark 2.1, using `sql(\"create table test stored as parquet as select 1\")`, we will fail to read it with Spark 2.0, as Spark 2.0 mistakenly treat it as data source table because there is a `provider` entry in table properties.\r\n\r\nLogically Hive serde table's provider is always hive, we don't need to store it in table properties, this PR removes it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanually test the forward compatibility issue.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-30T11:35:53Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T04:56:44Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T04:56:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33d48af7bee1600c2cc68c5033978973371b02f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00bdeff05faf542631d03c939f05842fbe89b71e","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:hive","ref":"hive","sha":"00bdeff05faf542631d03c939f05842fbe89b71e","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf SparkR is running as a package and it has previously downloaded Spark Jar it should be able to run as before without having to set SPARK_HOME. Basically with this bug the auto install Spark will only work in the first session.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a regression on the earlier behavior.\r\n\r\nFix is to always try to install or check for the cached Spark if running in an interactive session.\r\nAs discussed before, we should probably only install Spark iff running in an interactive session (R shell, RStudio etc)\r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe current build 5 separate pip binary tar balls, doubling the release script runtime. It'd be better to build one, especially for use cases that are just using Spark locally. In the long run, it would make more sense to have Hadoop support be pluggable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A - this is a release build script that doesn't have any automated test coverage. We will know if it goes wrong when we prepare releases.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-30T02:12:38Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T02:00:51Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T02:00:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0327e58ecb16a43084b054a5bc17e83dddb33a4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88b53c3b542d1423c169af7b4e52ecd6da067ced","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18639","ref":"SPARK-18639","sha":"88b53c3b542d1423c169af7b4e52ecd6da067ced","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to confusion between URI vs paths, in certain cases we escape partition values too many times, which causes some Hive client operations to fail or write data to the wrong location. This PR fixes at least some of these cases.\r\n\r\nTo my understanding this is how values, filesystem paths, and URIs interact.\r\n- Hive stores raw (unescaped) partition values that are returned to you directly when you call listPartitions.\r\n- Internally, we convert these raw values to filesystem paths via `ExternalCatalogUtils.[un]escapePathName`.\r\n- In some circumstances we store URIs instead of filesystem paths. When a path is converted to a URI via `path.toURI`, the escaped partition values are further URI-encoded. This means that to get a path back from a URI, you must call `new Path(new URI(uriTxt))` in order to decode the URI-encoded string.\r\n- In `CatalogStorageFormat` we store URIs as strings. This makes it easy to forget to URI-decode the value before converting it into a path.\r\n- Finally, the Hive client itself uses mostly Paths for representing locations, and only URIs occasionally.\r\n\r\nIn the future we should probably clean this up, perhaps by dropping use of URIs when unnecessary. We should also try fixing escaping for partition names as well as values, though names are unlikely to contain special characters.\r\n\r\ncc @mallman @cloud-fan @yhuai \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-30T01:47:54Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T08:50:44Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T08:50:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6abf252c334c43fc6eaea58ffcd81e3799078495","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1bd10ba05655981c46d3c6594d76e320a4fe4dff","head":{"label":"ericl:spark-18635","ref":"spark-18635","sha":"1bd10ba05655981c46d3c6594d76e320a4fe4dff","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n_This is the master branch-1.6 version of #15986; the original description follows:_\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a critical resource leak in the TaskScheduler which could cause RDDs and ShuffleDependencies to be kept alive indefinitely if an executor with running tasks is permanently lost and the associated stage fails.\r\n\r\nThis problem was originally identified by analyzing the heap dump of a driver belonging to a cluster that had run out of shuffle space. This dump contained several `ShuffleDependency` instances that were retained by `TaskSetManager`s inside the scheduler but were not otherwise referenced. Each of these `TaskSetManager`s was considered a \"zombie\" but had no running tasks and therefore should have been cleaned up. However, these zombie task sets were still referenced by the `TaskSchedulerImpl.taskIdToTaskSetManager` map.\r\n\r\nEntries are added to the `taskIdToTaskSetManager` map when tasks are launched and are removed inside of `TaskScheduler.statusUpdate()`, which is invoked by the scheduler backend while processing `StatusUpdate` messages from executors. The problem with this design is that a completely dead executor will never send a `StatusUpdate`. There is [some code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L338) in `statusUpdate` which handles tasks that exit with the `TaskState.LOST` state (which is supposed to correspond to a task failure triggered by total executor loss), but this state only seems to be used in Mesos fine-grained mode. There doesn't seem to be any code which performs per-task state cleanup for tasks that were running on an executor that completely disappears without sending any sort of final death message. The `executorLost` and [`removeExecutor`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L527) methods don't appear to perform any cleanup of the `taskId -> *` mappings, causing the leaks observed here.\r\n\r\nThis patch's fix is to maintain a `executorId -> running task id` mapping so that these `taskId -> *` maps can be properly cleaned up following an executor loss.\r\n\r\nThere are some potential corner-case interactions that I'm concerned about here, especially some details in [the comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L523) in `removeExecutor`, so I'd appreciate a very careful review of these changes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a new unit test to `TaskSchedulerImplSuite`.\r\n\r\n/cc @kayousterhout and @markhamstra, who

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `constraints` of an operator is the expressions that evaluate to `true` for all the rows produced. That means, the expression result should be neither `false` nor `unknown` (NULL). Thus, we can conclude that `IsNotNull` on all the constraints, which are generated by its own predicates or propagated from the children. The constraint can be a complex expression. For better usage of these constraints, we try to push down `IsNotNull` to the lowest-level expressions (i.e., `Attribute`). `IsNotNull` can be pushed through an expression when it is null intolerant. (When the input is NULL, the null-intolerant expression always evaluates to NULL.)\r\n\r\nBelow is the existing code we have for `IsNotNull` pushdown.\r\n```Scala\r\n  private def scanNullIntolerantExpr(expr: Expression): Seq[Attribute] = expr match {\r\n    case a: Attribute => Seq(a)\r\n    case _: NullIntolerant | IsNotNull(_: NullIntolerant) =>\r\n      expr.children.flatMap(scanNullIntolerantExpr)\r\n    case _ => Seq.empty[Attribute]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`IsNotNull` itself is not null-intolerant.** It converts `null` to `false`. If the expression does not include any `Not`-like expression, it works; otherwise, it could generate a wrong result. This PR is to fix the above function by removing the `IsNotNull` from the inference. After the fix, when a constraint has a `IsNotNull` expression, we infer new attribute-specific `IsNotNull` constraints if and only if `IsNotNull` appears in the root. \r\n\r\nWithout the fix, the following test case will return empty.\r\n```Scala\r\nval data = Seq[java.lang.Integer](1, null).toDF(\"key\")\r\ndata.filter(\"not key is not null\").show()\r\n```\r\nBefore the fix, the optimized plan is like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [value#1 AS key#3]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(value#1) && NOT isnotnull(value#1))\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, the optimized plan is like\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [value#1 AS key#3]\r\n+- Filter NOT isnotnull(value#1)\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:34:01Z","updated_at":"2017-02-11T06:57:27Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T11:43:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7294f5298da52bb809ae35c66b4ec613a0309fa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54c0dd10d4aabc4700d4a33206c481703c16fb83","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:isNotNull2","ref":"isNotNull2","sha":"54c0dd10d4aabc4700d4a33206c481703c16fb83","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`AggregateFunction` currently implements `ImplicitCastInputTypes` (which enables implicit input type casting). There are actually quite a few situations in which we don't need this, or require more control over our input. A recent example is the aggregate for `CountMinSketch` which should only take string, binary or integral types inputs.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `ImplicitCastInputTypes` from the `AggregateFunction` and makes a case-by-case decision on what kind of input validation we should use.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRefactoring only. Existing tests.","created_at":"2016-11-29T21:01:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T04:07:33Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T04:07:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58870693173873001a9b0138a42edbe8f24cb2ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f8e3d00a5150e079f0aa93c4266a347cda8290e","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18632","ref":"SPARK-18632","sha":"5f8e3d00a5150e079f0aa93c4266a347cda8290e","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe result of a `sum` aggregate function is typically a Decimal, Double or a Long. Currently the output dataType is based on input's dataType.\r\n\r\nThe `FunctionArgumentConversion` rule will make sure that the input is promoted to the largest type, and that also ensures that the output uses a (hopefully) sufficiently large output dataType. The issue is that sum is in a resolved state when we cast the input type, this means that rules assuming that the dataType of the expression does not change anymore could have been applied in the mean time. This is what happens if we apply `WidenSetOperationTypes` before applying the casts, and this breaks analysis.\r\n\r\nThe most straight forward and future proof solution is to make `sum` always output the widest dataType in its class (Long for IntegralTypes, Decimal for DecimalTypes & Double for FloatType and DoubleType). This PR implements that solution.\r\n\r\nWe should move expression specific type casting rules into the given Expression at some point.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded (regression) tests to SQLQueryTestSuite's `union.sql`.","created_at":"2016-11-29T19:47:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T09:57:55Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T07:27:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6697714a995535c0d7343012d2ecd4afa32353d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16063/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16063/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16063/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d54e88e6cdccfc64f96c12adc8bb4cca97cc746","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18622","ref":"SPARK-18622","sha":"0d54e88e6cdccfc64f96c12adc8bb4cca97cc746","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for native submission of spark jobs to a kubernetes cluster, as a first-class scheduler back-end.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nCurrently, testing has been mostly informal.  Integration tests will be added before completion.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThe initial branch on this PR is intended to serve as an \"MVP\" base for integrating various contributions to a \"k8s-native\" effort being conducted by several interested community members, including:\r\n\r\n@foxish, @erikerlandson, @iyanuobidele\r\nhttps://github.com/foxish/spark/tree/k8s-support/kubernetes\r\n\r\n@mccheah \r\nhttps://github.com/foxish/spark/pull/7\r\n\r\nGoals for integrating features include:\r\n\r\n- build of docker image (or images) for spark\r\n- integration tests\r\n- publishing of third-party resources\r\n- resource constraints\r\n- external shuffle service via daemon-sets\r\n- possible hooks for control of executor scale by kubernetes control plane\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nCurrent instructions for building at the time of this submission are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL only has `StringType`, when reading hive table with varchar column, we will read that column as `StringType`. However, we still need to use varchar `ObjectInspector` to read varchar column in hive table, which means we need to know the actual column type at hive side.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1, after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14363 , we parse hive type string to catalyst type, which means the actual column type at hive side is erased. Then we may use string `ObjectInspector` to read varchar column and fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps the original hive column type string in the metadata of `StructField`, and use it when we convert it to a hive column.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnewly added regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `ImplicitTypeCasts` doesn't handle casts between `ArrayType`s, this is not convenient, we should add a rule to enable casting from `ArrayType(InternalType)` to `ArrayType(newInternalType)`.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n1. Add a rule to `ImplicitTypeCasts` to enable casting between `ArrayType`s;\r\n2. Simplify `Percentile` and `ApproximatePercentile`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated test cases in `TypeCoercionSuite`.","created_at":"2016-11-29T10:21:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T02:09:40Z","closed_at":"2016-12-19T20:22:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7b0514b5dba0564409f04bbf546f5e8b8783176","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23089fafcb0b499fc249a1e88192089610144230","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:implicit-cast-complex-types","ref":"implicit-cast-complex-types","sha":"23089fafcb0b499fc249a1e88192089610144230","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the existing code, there are three layers of serialization\r\n    involved in sending a task from the scheduler to an executor:\r\n        - A Task object is serialized\r\n        - The Task object is copied to a byte buffer that also\r\n          contains serialized information about any additional JARs,\r\n          files, and Properties needed for the task to execute. This\r\n          byte buffer is stored as the member variable serializedTask\r\n          in the TaskDescription class.\r\n        - The TaskDescription is serialized (in addition to the serialized\r\n          task + JARs, the TaskDescription class contains the task ID and\r\n          other metadata) and sent in a LaunchTask message.\r\n    \r\nWhile it *is* necessary to have two layers of serialization, so that\r\nthe JAR, file, and Property info can be deserialized prior to\r\ndeserializing the Task object, the third layer of deserialization is\r\nunnecessary.  This commit eliminates a layer of serialization by moving\r\nthe JARs, files, and Properties into the TaskDescription class.\r\n\r\nThis commit also serializes the Properties manually (by traversing the map),\r\nas is done with the JARs and files, which reduces the final serialized size.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n## Performance benefit and comparison with #15505 \r\n\r\nThis is a simpler alternative to the approach proposed in #15505.\r\n\r\n@shivaram and I did some benchmarking of this and #15505 on a 20-machine m2.4xlarge EC2 machines (160 cores). We ran ~30 trials of code [1] (a very simple job with 10K tasks per stage) and measured the average time per stage:\r\n\r\nBefore this change: 2490ms\r\nWith this change: 2345 ms (so ~6% improvement over the baseline)\r\nWith @witgo's approach in #15505: 2046 ms (~18% improvement over baseline)\r\n\r\nThe reason that #15505 has a more significant improvement is that it also moves the serialization from the TaskSchedulerImpl thread to the CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend thread. I added that functionality on top of this change, and got almost the same improvement [1] as #15505 (average of 2103ms). I think we should decouple these two changes, both so we have some record of the improvement form each individual improvement, and because this change is more about simplifying the code base (the improvement is negligible) while the other is about performance improvement.  The plan, currently, is to merge this PR and then merge the remaining part of #15505 that moves serialization.\r\n\r\n[1] The reason the improvement wasn't quite as good as with #15505 when we ran the benchmarks is almost certainly because, at the point when we ran the benchmarks, I hadn't updated the code to manually serialize the Properties (instead the code was using Java's default serialization for the Properties object, whereas #15505 manually serialized the Properties).  This PR has since been updated to manually serialize the Properties, just like the other maps.","created_at":"2016-11-29T06:40:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T22:06:43Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T16:54:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b89d776cfb7ebb6b3778adf6cb266a4ab5a64254","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c983c8f0eafc4a9f7823d347feef572ec30e2b4a","head":{"label":"kayousterhout:SPARK-17931","ref":"SPARK-17931","sha":"c983c8f0eafc4a9f7823d347feef572ec30e2b4a","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17229881,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyOTg4MQ==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"kayousterhout/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout/spark-1","description":"Mirror

Hive functions are treated as non-temporary. Of the three hive functions, now \"percentile\" has been implemented natively, and \"hash\" has been removed. So we should update the list.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n_This is the master branch version of #15986; the original description follows:_\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a critical resource leak in the TaskScheduler which could cause RDDs and ShuffleDependencies to be kept alive indefinitely if an executor with running tasks is permanently lost and the associated stage fails.\r\n\r\nThis problem was originally identified by analyzing the heap dump of a driver belonging to a cluster that had run out of shuffle space. This dump contained several `ShuffleDependency` instances that were retained by `TaskSetManager`s inside the scheduler but were not otherwise referenced. Each of these `TaskSetManager`s was considered a \"zombie\" but had no running tasks and therefore should have been cleaned up. However, these zombie task sets were still referenced by the `TaskSchedulerImpl.taskIdToTaskSetManager` map.\r\n\r\nEntries are added to the `taskIdToTaskSetManager` map when tasks are launched and are removed inside of `TaskScheduler.statusUpdate()`, which is invoked by the scheduler backend while processing `StatusUpdate` messages from executors. The problem with this design is that a completely dead executor will never send a `StatusUpdate`. There is [some code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L338) in `statusUpdate` which handles tasks that exit with the `TaskState.LOST` state (which is supposed to correspond to a task failure triggered by total executor loss), but this state only seems to be used in Mesos fine-grained mode. There doesn't seem to be any code which performs per-task state cleanup for tasks that were running on an executor that completely disappears without sending any sort of final death message. The `executorLost` and [`removeExecutor`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L527) methods don't appear to perform any cleanup of the `taskId -> *` mappings, causing the leaks observed here.\r\n\r\nThis patch's fix is to maintain a `executorId -> running task id` mapping so that these `taskId -> *` maps can be properly cleaned up following an executor loss.\r\n\r\nThere are some potential corner-case interactions that I'm concerned about here, especially some details in [the comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L523) in `removeExecutor`, so I'd appreciate a very careful review of these changes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a new unit test to `TaskSchedulerImplSuite`.\r\n\r\n/cc @kayousterhout and @markhamstra, who

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExistenceJoin should be treated the same as LeftOuter and LeftAnti, not InnerLike and LeftSemi. This is not currently exposed because the rewrite of [NOT] EXISTS OR ... to ExistenceJoin happens in rule RewritePredicateSubquery, which is in a separate rule set and placed after the rule PushPredicateThroughJoin. During the transformation in the rule PushPredicateThroughJoin, an ExistenceJoin never exists.\r\n\r\nThe semantics of ExistenceJoin says we need to preserve all the rows from the left table through the join operation as if it is a regular LeftOuter join. The ExistenceJoin augments the LeftOuter operation with a new column called exists, set to true when the join condition in the ON clause is true and false otherwise. The filter of any rows will happen in the Filter operation above the ExistenceJoin.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nA(c1, c2): { (1, 1), (1, 2) }\r\n// B can be any value as it is irrelevant in this example\r\nB(c1): { (NULL) }\r\n\r\nselect A.*\r\nfrom   A\r\nwhere  exists (select 1 from B where A.c1 = A.c2)\r\n       or A.c2=2\r\n\r\nIn this example, the correct result is all the rows from A. If the pattern ExistenceJoin around line 935 in Optimizer.scala is indeed active, the code will push down the predicate A.c1 = A.c2 to be a Filter on relation A, which will incorrectly filter the row (1,2) from A.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSince this is not an exposed case, no new test cases is added. The scenario is discovered via a code review of another PR and confirmed to be valid with peer.","created_at":"2016-11-28T21:46:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T21:08:43Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T23:30:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01ce47c44d7c5b9c22d8b543616eab62b09685da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4002c741c3917c347c7be78b7ddfe053d25e5b6","head":{"label":"nsyca:spark-18614","ref":"spark-18614","sha":"d4002c741c3917c347c7be78b7ddfe053d25e5b6","user":{"login":"nsyca","id":18035343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM1MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18035343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca","html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64500866,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDUwMDg2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"nsyca/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsyca","id":18035343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM1MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18035343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca","html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsyca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsyca/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe currently push down join conditions of a Left Anti join to both sides of the join. This is similar to Inner, Left Semi and Existence (a specialized left semi) join. The problem is that this changes the semantics of the join; a left anti join filters out rows that matches the join condition.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by only pushing down conditions to the right hand side of the join. This is similar to the behavior of left outer join.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16026\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `FilterPushdownSuite.scala` and created a SQLQueryTestSuite file for left anti joins with a regression test.","created_at":"2016-11-28T16:06:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T19:26:31Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T19:26:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b40d285bf90c38dfe0ecb2ffc491aa2342c89ad1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f36c16d0676bf5b77215709c15b743a03c72eebc","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18597-branch-2.0","ref":"SPARK-18597-branch-2.0","sha":"f36c16d0676bf5b77215709c15b743a03c72eebc","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCostFun used to send a dense vector of zeroes as a closure in a\r\ntreeAggregate call. To avoid that, we replace treeAggregate by\r\nmapPartition + treeReduce, creating a zero vector inside the mapPartition\r\nblock in-place.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test for module mllib run locally for correctness.\r\n\r\nAs for performance we run an heavy optimization on our production data (50 iterations on 128 MB weight vectors) and have seen significant decrease in terms both of runtime and container being killed by lack of off-heap memory.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-28T15:42:14Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T02:15:52Z","closed_at":"2016-12-13T21:33:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63fe43a384d6973e141b0192db1a854232bc476a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18fcbba81168c741497c57ede2554ed0c8e48d2c","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:ENG-17719-lbfgs-only","ref":"ENG-17719-lbfgs-only","sha":"18fcbba81168c741497c57ede2554ed0c8e48d2c","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHive UDAFPercentile takes a double or an array of doubles as its second argument. Spark typically passes a decimal or an array of decimals. This will causes a failure during function lookup for the percentile function.\r\n\r\nWe added a stop-gap measure in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13930 for doubles, by retrying the lookup with all decimal arguments casted to doubles. This PR extends this approach by adding the same logic for arrays of decimals.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a temporary measure until https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14136 is merged.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we modify the codes corresponding to runApproximateJob so that we can get a result when the specified percent of tasks succeed.\r\nIn a production environment, 'long tail' is a common urgent problem. In practice, as long as we can get a specified percent of tasks' results, we can guarantee the final results. And this is a common requirement in the practice of machine learning algorithms.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe compile the codes by dev/make-distribution.sh, and deploy it on a cluster. and run a test codes reduce on the cluster, and we get the desired results.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18607\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-28T11:16:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T14:39:58Z","closed_at":"2016-12-23T14:39:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95b899e6f5571668b441b864f3d12ca0ae8ff5b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62691543505526f25f0f962c7bbaebe6d04510f5","head":{"label":"Ru-Xiang:my_change","ref":"my_change","sha":"62691543505526f25f0f962c7bbaebe6d04510f5","user":{"login":"Ru-Xiang","id":16226200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjI2MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16226200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Ru-Xiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74891086,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDg5MTA4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"Ru-Xiang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ru-Xiang","id":16226200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjI2MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16226200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Ru-Xiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ru-Xiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ru-Xiang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids a compilation error due to more than 64KB Java byte code size. This error occur since generated java code `SpecificSafeProjection.apply()` for nested JavaBeans is too big. This PR avoids this compilation error by splitting a big code chunk into multiple methods by calling `CodegenContext.splitExpression` at `InitializeJavaBean.doGenCode`\r\nAn object reference for JavaBean is stored to an instance variable `javaBean...`. Then, the instance variable will be referenced in the split methods.\r\n\r\nGenerated code with this PR\r\n````\r\n/* 22098 */   private void apply130_0(InternalRow i) {\r\n...\r\n/* 22125 */

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA vectorized parquet reader fails to read column data if data schema and partition schema overlap with each other and inferred types in the partition schema differ from ones in the data schema. An example code to reproduce this bug is as follows;\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> case class A(a: Long, b: Int)\r\nscala> val as = Seq(A(1, 2))\r\nscala> spark.createDataFrame(as).write.parquet(\"/data/a=1/\")\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.parquet(\"/data/\")\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\nscala> df.collect\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.vectorized.OnHeapColumnVector.getLong(OnHeapColumnVector.java:283)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.vectorized.ColumnarBatch$Row.getLong(ColumnarBatch.java:191)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n        at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.next(Iterator.scala:409)\r\n        at scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.next(Iterator.scala:409)\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that a logical layer (`HadoopFsRelation`) and a physical layer (`VectorizedParquetRecordReader`) have a different assumption on partition schema; the logical layer trusts the data schema to infer the type the overlapped partition columns, and, on the other hand, the physical layer trusts partition schema which is inferred from path string. To fix this bug, this pr simply updates `HadoopFsRelation.schema` to respect the partition columns position in data schema and respect the partition columns type in partition schema.\r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `CollapseWindow` optimizer rule changes the order of output attributes. This modifies the output of the plan, which the optimizer cannot do. This also breaks things like `collect()` for which we use a `RowEncoder` that assumes that the output attributes of the executed plan are equal to those outputted by the logical plan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have updated an incorrect test in `CollapseWindowSuite`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-28T01:30:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T10:58:52Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T10:58:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"956f10c9b075b6b84b73c592d6a9e6a9ad60ca1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53b91c83efd0b7d4dba00869dad098ecefbcfdb4","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18604","ref":"SPARK-18604","sha":"53b91c83efd0b7d4dba00869dad098ecefbcfdb4","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror
