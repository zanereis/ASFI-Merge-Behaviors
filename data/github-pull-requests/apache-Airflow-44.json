output of parallel tests especially for lowest-direct tests is very long because we are printing state every 10 seconds and there are many paralell test types (90+ for lowest direct). We do not need to print progress that often, and it has already been added in #39946 but one place to add it was missing - context manager still had the default 10 seconds refresh time.\r\n\r\nAfter this change the output will be printed every 20 seconds in the regular tests and every 2 minutes in \"lowest-direct\" tests (controlled by env variable) so the output should be much easier to find reasons for issues.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

At first i thought that in Airflow 3 we could just use Dataset.uri, as it will raise an error when a normalizer fails, but there can still be schems without a normalizer defined so i felt like this is needed.\r\n\r\nAlso small adjustment to ProvidersManager: I felt like this dataset-uris part of provider.yml is getting complex, so i re-wrote the `_discover_dataset_uri_handlers` method to be more flexible for future expansions (f.e. OL to AIP-60 converters).\r\n\r\nThis Pr should be only merged AFTER #40335.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the

PR is related to the upgrade of google-ads dependency. There is a new API version on Google Ads API and Google Ads API tends to deprecate too quickly. So we are trying to increase the dependency version to match with the latest version.\r\n\r\nSince we mostly use the types from the underlying library it is safe to upgrade. Also the users can give specific API version to override default value and use the previous API versions.\r\n\r\nHere is the \"Deprecation and sunset page\" of Google Ads API: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/sunset-dates.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

affected).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI made sure the new test fails with the old implementation + MySQL/Postgres.

Since this is a pretty big feature, we only completed the selection itself and not the state change. We are leaving up to you if we should just hide the functionality of this code to be a base for another PR that implements the state change feature, or continue updating this PR. We would need some opinions on how this functionality should behave when interacting with marking state as. Since changing a state of a task can affect the state of another task, how should the states of multiple tasks be handled.\r\n\r\nAlso for now we've made selected tasks stand out by applying a darker blue background. This helped differentiate between selected tasks, since when multiple tasks within the same rows and columns are chosen it was unclear which tasks were selected.\r\n\r\nVideo before/after changes:

PR #38021 we added log grouping into log printing. We all love this feature but I got some negative feedback for cases where people look for a failed task: If you are not an Airflow expert and you look for the exception/eror in the logs, in many cases the exception is not printed. If the task execution fails in an exception the exception trace will be in the \"Post task execution logs\" group that you need to un-fold.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the \"Post task execution logs\" behind the exception print. Side effect is (due to placement) that error handling code might be called before (on success/skip handler will be called after/inside the group though).\r\n\r\nBefore - no exception in failed task:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/038860cc-4154-41aa-8df5-6d609bf537b8)\r\n\r\n...and you needed to un-fold to see it - note that on_failure_callback is also executed before post block:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/9dbe0b69-b281-466b-b369-7da300c9ef41)\r\n\r\nAfter - exception is moved in front of log group:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/d0a76dd6-eadf-48ef-8181-2b9c2860685d)\r\n\r\nPlus tasks without exception have no change in beautiful text:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/e7adeaaa-f455-4443-ad30-7327da1b5025)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-08T20:33:14Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T09:57:48Z","closed_at":"2024-06-08T21:07:31Z","merged_at":"2024-06-08T21:07:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"297ad80c7d5799b3cefcd58366d986a5ad4b43dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

If the trigger ends the task instance, the `method_name` should be None. Otherwise, provide the `method_name` to be used when resuming the execution in the task.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we only paid attention to failure requests in `_execute_task_callbacks`. Now, we also execute any given callback type directly. In this scenario, the callback is submitted remotely, so we assume there's no need to change the state; we simply run the callback.\r\n\r\n> **Note**: Exiting from the trigger works only when listeners are not integrated for the deferrable operator. To use this feature, unregister the listeners, and set end_from_trigger=True on the given operator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduce `end_from_trigger` in each Async operator which end the task directly from the triggerer without going into the worker. For example:\r\n```\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    \"async_dag\",\r\n) as dag:\r\n    async_date_time_sensor = DateTimeSensorAsync(\r\n        task_id=\"async_date_time_sensor\",\r\n        target_time=\"\"\"{{ macros.datetime.utcnow() + macros.timedelta(minutes=1) }}\"\"\",\r\n        end_from_trigger=True,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    async_time_delta = TimeDeltaSensorAsync(\r\n        task_id=\"async_time_delta\",\r\n        delta=datetime.timedelta(minutes=1),\r\n        end_from_trigger=False,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    async_time_sensor = TimeSensorAsync(\r\n        task_id=\"async_time_sensor\",\r\n        timeout=1,\r\n        soft_fail=True,\r\n        target_time=(datetime.datetime.now(tz=dt.timezone.utc) + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)).time(),\r\n        end_from_trigger=True,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nBy default `end_from_trigger` is `False`.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR builds on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39890 (already merged).\r\n\r\nAfter this change, OpenLineage will execute metadata extraction in separate, forked process. \r\nIt's a technique modeled to what interaction between `LocalTaskJobRunner` and `StandardTaskRunner` looks like - a process, in this case process of `StandardTaskRunner` watches over OpenLineage listener process during metadata extraction. \r\n\r\nThis adds a layer of isolation between task execution and OpenLineage, adding a level of assurance that OpenLineage execution does not interfere with task execution in a way other than taking time.\r\nAdditionally, this allows us to add configurable timeout for OL execute methods.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is, beyond configurability, that sometimes metadata extraction code can hang - for example, when dealing with Snowflake connection issue https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1898 - and we want to give as much guarantees that OL will not cause task to fail.","created_at":"2024-06-05T21:37:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-29T17:32:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-14T17:04:41Z","merged_at":"2024-06-14T17:04:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a8d12ffe50c947583c6419d4e952d0f59461135","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

However, various components of Airflow work perfectly fine when given the chance. I have a use case where I'm running a unit test that involve creating a `DagBag`. When running this on Windows, Airflow exits prematurely due to how [absolute db paths are determined](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388#issuecomment-2132154600). Interestingly, when disabling the check, thus allowing Airflow to \"do its thing\", the `DagBag `is created correctly and the test suite passes.\r\n\r\n**The proposed change adds support for testing path absoluteness on Windows systems.**\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

#40043\r\n\r\nIn the latest google providers version (10.19.0), importing `bigquery` operators results in importing the `openlineage` package even when the openlineage provider is not installed. \r\n\r\nThis refactors the code so all imports to the `openlineage` package happen only inside `get_openlineage_facets_on_*` again.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39614 moved the mixin to `openlineage/utils.py` and this brings it back to `operators/bigquery.py` to keep the top-level `openlineage` imports in `utils.py`, and even worse because the mixin is now bulkier thank before. Another option would be to move `BigQueryJobRunFacet` and `BigQueryErrorRunFacet` to another file, and move all `openlineage` top-level imports in `utils.py` inside methods.

we are running compatibility tests, some providers might be explicitly selected because PRs are running selective checks and the provider is seen as \"affected\" by the change. However, when we are runing compatibility tests, we sometimes want to exclude providers via `--skip-providers` flag because those providers might be incompatible with the version of Airflow we test.\r\n\r\nIn case both - selective checks selects a provider and --skip-providers is set for those providers we now remove the explicitly specified provider from the list of pytest args.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
