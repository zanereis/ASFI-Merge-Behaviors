This provides a more consistent way to fine-tune the scanning of packages. <code>ScanOption</code> provides several features, which can be mixed and matched:\n<ul>\n<li><code>ScanOption.recursive()</code> to search recursively. This replaces <code>forPackage(String packageName, boolean scanRecursively)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ScanOption.mustExtend(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</code> to find only classes that extend or implement the given type. This replaces <code>forPackage(String packageName, Class&lt;?&gt; mustExtend)</code>. Note that this overload used to search recursively too; this is no longer the case. If you want a recursive search that also only matches subtypes, you have to combine <code>ScanOption.recursive()</code> and <code>ScanOption.mustExtend(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ScanOption.except(Class&lt;?&gt;... types)</code> to find all classes except the given ones. This replaces <code>forPackage(...).except(Class&lt;?&gt;... types)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ScanOption.except(Predicate&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; exclusionPredicate)</code> to exclude all classes that match the given predicate. This replaces <code>forPackage(...).except(Predicate&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; exclusionPredicate)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ScanOption.ignoreExternalJars()</code> to not throw an exception when attempting to scan a package from a third-party jar file. This can be useful if you have a split package between a dependency and your own codebase. This is a new option. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/1040\">Issue 1040</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Deprecated</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>forPackage(String packageName, boolean scanRecursively)</code>: replaced by <code>ScanOption.recursive()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>forPackage(String packageName, Class&lt;?&gt; mustExtend)</code>: replaced by <code>ScanOption.mustExtend(Class&lt;?&gt; type)</code> combined with <code>ScanOption.recursive()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>forPackage(...).except(Class&lt;?&gt;... types)</code>: replaced by <code>ScanOption.except(Class&lt;?&gt;... type)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>forPackage(...).except(Predicate&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;... exclusionPredicate)</code>: replaced by <code>ScanOption.except(Predicate&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; exclusionPredicate)</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/b600db33429cdc2e77b0d0532cba770b7e4ad294\"><code>b600db3</code></a> Bumps version to 3.19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/f781b661e4a4f56d1c07aa8441323ddf6f7ba2ca\"><code>f781b66</code></a> Updates CHANGELOG for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/0dfee0e5dfed595770a5609423b9ae6332c7e31c\"><code>0dfee0e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/1044\">#1044</a> from jqno/dependabot/maven/dependencies-eda37e8de9</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/9b28748ec4f5199639b5b86c02b554482aad639e\"><code>9b28748</code></a> Bump the dependencies group with 2 updates</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/bf9da2077927a4b956310dbbd0dca125877d4c86\"><code>bf9da20</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/1043\">#1043</a> from jqno/rethink-forpackage-api</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/dc2d3da2dedc0ba95ff66b185154fd20cc3f8e67\"><code>dc2d3da</code></a> Updates docs for ScanOption</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/3776c4346d9653d77aff9c89de4b68e41ca5259c\"><code>3776c43</code></a> Introduces ScanOption.ignoreExternalJars</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/a137d345bfcc7e8f281ceff44b581e4a984697ea\"><code>a137d34</code></a> Adds some hardening to ScanOption</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/acd326558eb446d0a3109246c3a769dad3c3f014\"><code>acd3265</code></a> Adds ScanOption.except (for predicates)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/commit/64fb6a471bac01e9cb6e38e2a2d8331857b2bb6d\"><code>64fb6a4</code></a> Adds ScanOption.except (for classes)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/compare/equalsverifier-3.18.2...equalsverifier-3.19\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=nl.jqno.equalsverifier:equalsverifier&package-manager=maven&previous-version=3.18.2&new-version=3.19)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>  arrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost / root <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset).

Generally it is better to use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element.

The previous behavior was\nintended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to\nhow browsers behave. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483\">1483</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/71063c3d4bb4bcc83c4655bdf6347ce2f5670a7c\"><code>71063c3</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.18.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1a91aac56176edcb2327569feb5aff5282f8cacb\"><code>1a91aac</code></a> Use the incoming node's parent if outgoing has already been removed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/df404cf5ac12fb295e8abd9e05de1dcbcea30657\"><code>df404cf</code></a> test case for Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">#2212</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/28db617354cc2ed60a8b978865e71e5d7c6b6224\"><code>28db617</code></a> Test for <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1938\">#1938</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d27370ac7ecd7eee843b3153c81f44e46b4ef63c\"><code>d27370a</code></a> Follow spec so <code>&lt;</code> can start an attribute name</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/0ef4b70b2acf47c1094aedbb9954324a2e84c05e\"><code>0ef4b70</code></a> Allow <code>&lt;</code> in tag name state</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/51909b1af727eea21bc011633519e31aaff82048\"><code>51909b1</code></a> Tweak HTML javadoc <code>&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/91b5a56c63a9f8dca761b4cab959977fcd3308fd\"><code>91b5a56</code></a> Copy attribute source range when merging attributes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/5ee376bc5bbe6a4f66eb24e2180552b547b8a4bf\"><code>5ee376b</code></a> Entity decoding supports prefix matches</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/708fc1fc5e41b8bb02d0ce15a9da8086f6bdb9dd\"><code>708fc1f</code></a> Make And and Or constructors public</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.18.1...jsoup-1.18.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.18.1&new-version=1.18.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

PR fixes an ordering issue for the user event listeners. The isConnected method does return false for less than 1ms which causes an exception because the connection is discared immediately, ignoring that it's not fully connected yet.\r\n\r\n1. MAIN-Thread: `Camel Plc4XEndpoint.setupConnection()`: Connection is established and waits for the `sessionSetupCompleteFuture` to complete.\r\n2. CHILD-Thread: `S7HMuxImpl.userEventTriggered()` is called and the `super.userEventTriggered()` method calls all user event listeners\r\n3. CHILD-Thread: `DefaultNettyPlcConnection.getChannelHandler......userEventTriggered()` is called, which completes the `sessionSetupCompleteFuture`. \r\n4. MAIN-Thread: Camel `Plc4XEndpoint.setupConnection()` method continues and checks if `S7HPlcConnection.isConnected()` but the `IS_CONNECTED` was not set yet and so the connection is closed immediately\r\n5. CHILD-Thread: `S7HMuxImpl.userEventTriggered()` method continues and sets the `IS_CONNECTED`\r\n\r\n\r\nBy moving the `super.userEventTriggered()` to the end of the method, the order of the above steps changes to 1, 2, 5, 3, 4 and the bug does not happen.\r\n\r\nLog:\r\n```\r\n2024-11-08 10:45:16,107  INFO | main                 | o.a.plc4x.java.s7.readwrite.protocol.S7ProtocolLogic    | S7 Driver running in ACTIVE mode.\r\n2024-11-08 10:45:16,108  INFO | main                 | org.apache.plc4x.java.s7.readwrite.protocol.S7HMuxImpl  | 10:45:16.108880 userEventTriggered: Multiplexor Event: org.apache.plc4x.java.spi.events.ConnectEvent@6caa4dc5\r\n2024-11-08 10:45:16,112  INFO | ioEventLoopGroup-2-1 | org.apache.plc4x.java.s7.readwrite.protocol.S7HMuxImpl  | Unregistered of channel: PRIMARY\r\n2024-11-08 10:45:16,112  INFO | ioEventLoopGroup-2-1 | org.apache.plc4x.java.s7.readwrite.protocol.S7HMuxImpl  | io.netty.channel.embedded.EmbeddedEventLoop@325cf450\r\n2024-11-08 10:45:16,159  WARN | ioEventLoopGroup-3-1 | io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline                 | An exceptionCaught() event was fired, and it reached at the tail of the pipeline.
