When user edited a filter without changing it's scope, `chartsInScope` and `tabsInScope` were being set to undefined, which was causing an caused an error described in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14975.\r\nThis PR fixes it by merging edited filter into the old filter rather than overriding it. Since the edited filter object has exactly the same fields as the old filter except `chartsInScope` and `tabsInScope`, what really happens is that we override the old filter and add `chartsInScope` and `tabsInScope` fields.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: See linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/120797636-97c65800-c53c-11eb-96ac-8c34f35bb801.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently both the Range and Select filters automatically apply the fetch values predicate from the dataset to the query. A PR was opened to add functionality for making the predicate optional (#14264), but this became largely obsolete with the introduction of adhoc and time filters that were made available in the filter config modal (#14313).

SUMMARY\r\nSmall improvements to range filter:\r\n- Add smart number formatter to make ranges more legible.\r\n- When lower and upper bounds are at min/max, assume no filter should be emitted. Also when either lower or upper bound is greater/smaller than min/max, only emit single filter.\r\n- Add custom label using formatter.\r\n- Add markers that indicate when lower/upper bound is being applied (also using number formatter).\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- Added story book entry\r\n- Added simple test case\r\n\r\n(both story and test cases can be expanded later)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120781403-bbd06c00-c531-11eb-898f-5992927ea952.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120781204-80ce3880-c531-11eb-9675-3c18bbd2b32f.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nConverted TableElement to TypeScript.\r\n\r\nRequired me to move the expand icon with tooltip off the Collapse.Panel component on to the Collapse parent component where it was supposed to be. Allowed me to remove most of the inline styling in the expand icon because the styles are now being inherited correctly.\r\n\r\nMade code more concise and readable wherever I could.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nShould look and behave the same\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- To test TableElement navigate to the route superset/sqllab\r\n- On the left towards the bottom there should be a drop-down saying Select table or type table name\r\n- Use the drop-down and select some tables and below the drop-down, some TableElement components should appear\r\n- Check them out\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14683\r\nsuperset-ui related PR: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1148\r\n\r\nSince the early Superset TableSource references to Druid table structure, there was always a time dimension(time partition column) in all tables(as known as, datasource or dataset). But this concept is not suitable for other data warehouses or databases. \r\n\r\nThere is a `main_dttm_col` field in the superset dataset, service time dimension. Now if a time column is not passed to superset backend, the `main_dttm_col` will be used in the time column. \r\n\r\nThis change \r\n- allows Superset to receive null time column\r\n- force user update time column value when user changed existing time column type(for instance: uncheck is_temporal)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/120643352-a3683f00-c4a8-11eb-9ed7-b9f3713236c9.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/120643003-2b017e00-c4a8-11eb-9b11-59aac1384351.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently enabling cascading in native filters requires instantly applying filters, causing all charts in scope to rerender and retrigger queries. This PR changes child filters to apply the currently selected data mask of the parent filter instead of the currently applied one, removing the need to instantly apply filters.\r\n\r\nWhile making the changes, I considered moving `dataMaskSelected` into Redux instead of adding it as a prop on the chain of components. However, I noticed that many of the intermediate components between the filter tab and `FilterValue` were already using `dataMaskSelected`, which made the benefits of moving it to Redux less appealing. In addition, adding it to Redux would have required either\r\n- introducing a new `dataMaskSelected` property to complement the `dataMask` property (which contains the applied data mask) in the state tree\r\n\r\nor \r\n- refactoring `dataMask` so that it would be split into `dataMask.applied` and `dataMask.selected`\r\n\r\nSince both of these would have required fairly significant refactoring, it seems better to perform this refactoring later when the full scope of refactoring needs is clear (e.g. will some of this state be moved into Context or be kept in Redux).\r\n\r\n### BFEORE\r\nCurrently each time a parent filter is changed, it triggers the filter automatically:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120623645-962b6000-c468-11eb-86b5-db95319691f4.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the parent filter only retriggers the child filters (applying works like before):\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120628894-e2c56a00-c46d-11eb-8200-51d2c73ea10d.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with cascading filters\r\n2. Make sure the parent filter is *not* set to \"Apply changes instantly\"\r\n3. Change the selection in the parent filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n#14933 caused a regression for cascading filters. This was caused by the fact that filters with a parent aren't rendered in the filter tab, causing index referencing to the array of nodes in the portal to fall out of sync. This PR does the following:\r\n- does not attempt to render a cascading popover for nodes that have a parent (these will be rendered within the parent's popover)\r\n- checks the index for the in scope filters from the unfiltered filter array, as the portal node needs to be referenced by this (not the filtered cascading filter array).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCascading filters caused an error when rendering the filter tab due to the index being referenced on the unfiltered portal node array didn't exist on the cascade filters array:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120609338-bfdd8a80-c45a-11eb-9d9e-df6b4c50ab1d.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow cascading filters show up as expected (\"Continent\" is the parent of \"Country\", while \"Country code\" is unhierarchical):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/120609415-d1269700-c45a-11eb-8727-16f24ff8aa89.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn SQL Lab we wrap the error message in a `<MonospaceDiv>` to show the error messages with a monospaced font. But this is being dropped if there's a custom error component registered for the error.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by passing the monospaced error (`subtitle`) to the custom error component.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2021-06-02 Superset(4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/120580184-96324e00-c3dd-11eb-9fe4-7482a8820736.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2021-06-02 Superset(3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/120580021-4d7a9500-c3dd-11eb-9aab-f743f9202c87.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAfter the recent addition of the superset_text.yml file that allows us to add specific text overwrites, there was an ask to make this text translatable. This change adds a key to the translation files that matches the key in the superset_text.yml file. It is up to the admin of the application to add their specific translation to that file on their local working system. I did not provide a way for people to overwrite that key, just exposed the key into the file. Any other suggestions to that end welcome.\r\n\r\nI also added a make command for running translations on development\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nWith no overwrite or translation:\r\n<img width=\"490\" alt=\"_DEV__Superset\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/120567886-958ebd00-c3c7-11eb-937d-3cf3dd20f192.png\">\r\n\r\nWith only translation:\r\n<img width=\"489\" alt=\"_DEV__Superset\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/120567781-5d877a00-c3c7-11eb-8726-3bafa54c3799.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWith overwrite text and translation: \r\n<img width=\"499\" alt=\"_DEV__Superset\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/120567571-fe296a00-c3c6-11eb-8eac-9e1216f4e975.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMost importantly we should test that this change didn't introduce regressions.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset uses the `dateutil.parser` library parses a string to the date object. The current behavior will use the `now` as the \"conversion anchor\". for instance(now is 2017-06-02 CST):\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> from dateutil.parser import parse\r\n>>> parse(\"2017\")\r\ndatetime.datetime(2017, 6, 2, 0, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new behavior will use the first day of the year(01 Jan) for this \"conversion anchor\"\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> from datetime import datetime\r\n>>> default = datetime(year=datetime.now().year, month=1, day=1)\r\n>>> parse('2017', default=default)\r\ndatetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1, 0, 0)\r\n>>> parse('2017-9', default=default)\r\ndatetime.datetime(2017, 9, 1, 0, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n####\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/120464395-7562fc00-c3cf-11eb-999d-9827bf8e27d5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/120464174-38970500-c3cf-11eb-8fd6-fa0320819e58.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nOn dashboards with tabs, native filters that are out of scope of currently focused tab should be hidden.\r\nWhen user opens a dashboard with top level tabs, the active top level tab is used as an initially focused tab. For dashboards without top level tabs, initially every filter is considered to be in scope, until the user clicks on a tab.\r\nHidden filters are moved to a new collapsible section in the native filters panel. In order to prevent expensive rerendering of native filters when they are moved in and out of collapsible, I used `react-reverse-portal` library, which utilizes React portals to perform reparenting without unmounting and remounting the child. In our case, it was essential, as each native filter sends a request to backend on mount - if a user had many native filters with narrow scopes, we'd risk having lots of redundant API calls on each tab change.\r\nMoreover, I optimized finding charts and tabs in scope for each native filter. Before, functions that traverse the whole component tree in search for charts and tabs were called every time a native filter was focused. Now, they are called once for each filter when the filters are initialized (and then again when filter's scope or dashboard layout changes).\r\n\r\nIn case of dashboards without any tabs, there are no visible changes.\r\n\r\nPotential improvements:\r\n1. Show currently focused tab's name. I'd love some **design input** on that, as I'm not sure where to put tab's name on the filter panel and how to make it consistent with the rest of the design. I believe that would improve user experience a lot, as it might be confusing for the user why some filters are marked as \"out of scope\".\r\n2. Currently for dashboards without top level tabs, we start with every filter being considered to be in scope. After a user focuses on some tab, there is no way to return to the initial state. It might be problematic in cases when there are charts not attached to any tab group - after some tab has been focused, we can never return to the state where a chart outside of any tab group is \"in scope\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/120353413-f0f67780-c301-11eb-8f5f-e4b0b9fd2167.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Set `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag to True.\r\n1. Create a dashboard with tabs (try both top level tabs + grid level tabs and only grid level tabs) and add some native filters with different scopes.\r\n2. Verify that when you change tabs, filters that are out of scope of current tab are moved to collapsed section.\r\n3. Verify that native filters are not rerendered - when you switch tabs, there shouldn't be any new api calls related to native filters.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 6.\r\n- Removes the sort option for the numeric range filter type\r\n- When the left panel vertical scroll is enabled, automatically scrolls down when adding a new item\r\n- Adds a TODO to rename the filter plugins\r\n- Fixes a bug where the parent filter disappeared after refreshing the dashboard\r\n- Sets a min-width for the left panel to deal with the case when we don't have any filter\r\n- Opens the Advanced section if any of its options are checked\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Remove horizontal scroll when the column select is too wide\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n- Split the FiltersConfigForm into smaller components to make it easier to read and remove react warnings\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the filter box control panel shows legacy Druid specific controls even when legacy Druid isn't enabled.

SUMMARY\r\nHarmonize AntD Select components that are used in Explore/Dashboard view. This changes the following:\r\n- Changes AdHoc Filter Select to show the `StopOutline` Icon if \"NOT IN\" operator is selected. This is to align the behavior with the native select filter polish introduced in #14873\r\n- Show \"Create: <value>\" instead of \"<value>\" when given the option to create a select option that doesn't exist in the dataset. This is to mimic the behavior of the `react-select` based component used in Filter Box: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119962068-591a2600-bfaf-11eb-903e-7dd837af7795.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nWhen \"NOT IN\" is selected in the adhoc filter popover, we currently use the default `CheckOutlined` icon:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119961520-d4c7a300-bfae-11eb-9178-fe50cf0957e2.png)\r\nWhen being presented with the option to create a value that doesn't exist in the dataset, the option to use a value that doesn't exist is shown as-is:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119962266-88c92e00-bfaf-11eb-968d-7e7e6fbbfe3b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen \"NOT IN\" is selected in the adhoc filter popover, we now use the `StopOutlined`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119960095-47d01a00-bfad-11eb-81c0-cce508d98212.png)\r\nWhen being presented with the option to create a value that doesn't exist in the dataset, The creatable value is prefixed with \"Create\" and the value placed inside quotes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119961707-06406e80-bfaf-11eb-8b1e-e9aae7d0442f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset now uses `generic_type` to determine the icon that displays the column type. The `generic type` is an abstraction of the database column type, such as:\r\n- integer/number/float mapping to `NUMERIC`\r\n- varchar/text/string mapping to `STRING`\r\n- datetime/timestamp mapping to `TEMPORAL`\r\n- boolean/tinyint mapping to `BOOLEAN`\r\n\r\nBut there is one exception for historical reasons:\r\n- The user can set a column as a datetime type, even if the column is of another column type. unfortunately this is not done by a SQL cast expression function, just a flag.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolve returns the `TEMPORAL` by determining whether the column contains the is_dttm flag, no matter what type it is.\r\n\r\nNOTICE:  There is no such logic to `calculated column`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n<img width=\"1445\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/119958530-b5903c00-bfd5-11eb-8f03-2075fbed534c.png\">\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/119959278-6eef1180-bfd6-11eb-80d9-adf42b1d55e7.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCould not build docker image on arm64 (Oracle Cloud A1) with current master. Bumped pyarrow from 3.0.0 to 4.0.0 and now it builds with no issues.\r\n\r\nThis patch means that superset can probably now run on a 64bit Raspberry Pi 4.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nthis PR is an urgent fix for regression introduced by #14841. Before #14841, when multiple select checkbox is unchecked in filterbox, selected filter value can not pass through query and trigger chart render on dashboard.  Unfortunately, this PR introduced a regression that when there's time range filter in the filterbox, time filter value as STRING gets converted into array. This change doesn't affect any other control in the filterbox.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a fix forward of #14841, and will resolve both the original issue #14804 and the regression mentioned above. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/119920723-60393800-bf9f-11eb-8e88-b97040b2ca90.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/119920555-1bad9c80-bf9f-11eb-92ca-41b99557db12.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 5.\r\n- Adds a scroll bar to the left panel\r\n- Fixes left panel layout when the scroll is active\r\n- Adjusts the fonts and colors to match the design\r\n- Makes the tabs stick to the top while scrolling\r\n- Moves the required icon to the right side of the text\r\n- Changes ‚ÄúAdhoc filters‚Äù to ‚ÄúPre-filter‚Äù\r\n- Moves the collapses arrow to the right\r\n- Changes the title to \"Filter configuration\"\r\n- Adds the \"Filters\" header\r\n- Changes the filter types names \r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Remove horizontal scroll when the column select is too wide\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n- Split the FiltersConfigForm into smaller components to make it easier to read\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFully revamped the DB Connection Flow for users to easily add their databases to the metastore. With the new DB Connection Modal, we are able to build custom forms (dynamic forms) for whatever databases/engines we want.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently setting a select filter to \"inverse selection\" doesn't visually indicate that the emitted WHERE clause is in fact a \"NOT IN\" as opposed to the normal \"IN\". This replaces the normal `CheckOutlined` icon with `StopOutlined` when inverse selection is applied. In addition, a new reserved parameter `label` is introduced on `filterState`, which makes it possible to customize the indicator label.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to consider adding support for being able to pass `ReactNode` labels to be able to further customize the indicator label. If this seems like a good approach, I'll add the `label` property to the `DataMask` type in `@superset-ui/core`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the dropdown icon for both regular and inverse selection are a checkmark:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119851180-dfcef480-bf16-11eb-8c43-041fc803586a.png)\r\n\r\nThe filter indicator also only shows the values as such, without indicating that the values are excluded:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119851372-068d2b00-bf17-11eb-9899-087bdcb79e31.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the dropdown icon signals that the selected values are excluded:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119850748-7cdd5d80-bf16-11eb-8edc-ea878a8b51b6.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the filter indicator text now signals that the selected values are in fact excluded, not included:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119851052-c332bc80-bf16-11eb-9038-1730d094bdf3.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes support for default first value in Select native filter. It includes next logic:\r\n- if one of control panel items contains `requiredFirst` flag we cancel delay of native filters loading, delay charts loading until this filter will be initialized - we do assumption if `filterState.value === undefined`, it means that filter not initialized\r\n- if it has `defaultToFirstValue` option enabled - we save on `filterState.value` undefined value and on filter loading we on the fly put first value\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56388545/119837538-5b2aa900-bf0b-11eb-9eee-83c90402477d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe Postgres driver returns an error message that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncolumn \"first_name\" does not exist\r\nLINE 1: SELECT first_name from birth_names\r\n               ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich gets displayed in the toaster as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncolumn \"first_name\" does not exist LINE 1: SELECT first_name from birth_names ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR simply strips the caret so the message looks nicer.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 4.\r\n- Handle the correct tab selection when validating\r\n- Add a required icon and validation to the controllers when their checkbox is checked\r\n- The controls with affectsDataMask are disabled unless the default value picker is enabled\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Add a scroll bar to the left panel\r\n- Fix left panel layout when the scroll is active\r\n- Adjust fonts and colors to match the design\r\n- Make the tabs stick to the top while scrolling\r\n- Remove horizontal scroll when the column select is too wide\r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n\r\n- Split the FiltersConfigForm into smaller components to make it easier to read\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe current import API needs to raise an error if the user tries to import and invalid file.\r\n\r\nSince we check which files are valid, I added a simple test to all import APIs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif not contents:\r\n    raise NoValidFilesFoundError()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich returns an error message with a 400 HTTP status code.\r\n\r\nI also took the time to SIP-41-fy the endpoints, removing the `@safe` decorator so exceptions can bubble up to the error handlers. Since the exceptions that the command can raise all have the correct HTTP status codes, this will preserve the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nTested manually with an invalid import.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a follow up to #14486 and implements @mistercrunch 's suggestion to reorder selected values (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14486#issuecomment-834706507). Previously, selected values were left in their original place in the native select filter. **This change emulates that of the GitHub tag component, which places the selected values on top after the new values are persisted.**\r\n\r\nThe plan is to add this functionality to the main Select component used throughout Superset in the future (probably as a prop that defaults to being disabled). However, to avoid causing potential functional or visual regressions in the application, this functionality will be kept only within the native filter component for now until it has been found to be fully stable.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the selected values stayed in their original positions after the dropdown was collapsed:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119669257-97450780-be40-11eb-909c-34f81518354e.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the values are reordered when the dropdown is not visible:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/119669275-9b712500-be40-11eb-86e8-0ff621da784d.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR uses the validation api and the new LabeledErrorBoundInput component to validate a person's db connection as they are filling out the form. The validation happens on blur. \r\n\r\nWe plan to add some client side validation on types such as checking that hostnames don't have spaces and port is a number, etc. That will come in a separate PR. For now, all of this work is not visible to the user. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/119589260-4c1aee00-bd87-11eb-8914-129f58e9ed8d.mov\r\n\r\nI left the network requests tab open so that we can evaluate how many requests are made during this flow, to see if it needs to be optimized. We could evaluate if anything changed on blur if needed. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFor now, let's make sure that this code doesn't break anything existing. Try creating a database and editing one. \r\n\r\nBecause of how RTL tests visually and we can't access this feature unless by hard-coding a param, we'll add more tests in a future PR before making this visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nUpdate the TableElement class component to be a functional component using hooks.\r\n\r\nModified the tests slightly where needed to check the changes to DOM from updating the state instead of checking the component state itself. Was necessary because functional components using hooks don't have an accessible state like class components.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe component should look and function the same\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo run the tests for TableElement navigate to superset-frontend and run `npm run test -- spec/javascripts/sqllab/TableElement_spec.jsx`\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nImproves the native filters UI/UX - iteration 3.\r\n- Splits the controllers and organize them into Basic and Advanced sections\r\n- Automatically populate and refresh the select options based on the form state\r\n- Removes the Populate and Refresh buttons simplifying the user experience \r\n- Expands the Basic section by default\r\n- Adds the ability to dynamically render a controller using checkboxes\r\n- Adjusts the tests\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the [Native dashboard filter project](https://github.com/apache/superset/projects/12)\r\n\r\nThe items below will be handled in the next iterations:\r\n- Handle the correct tab selection when validating\r\n- Add a required icon and validation to the controllers when their checkbox is checked\r\n- Add a scroll bar to the left panel\r\n- Fix left panel layout when the scroll is active\r\n- Adjust fonts and colors to match the design\r\n- Make the tabs stick to the top while scrolling\r\n- Remove horizontal scroll when the column select is too wide\r\n- The controls with affectsDataMask are disabled unless the default value picker is enabled\r\n\r\nThe iterations below are optional but recommended:\r\n- Split the FiltersConfigForm into smaller components to make it easier to read\r\n- Unify the select components to use the AntD one. Currently, we have different selects with different themes and interactions.\r\n\r\n@villebro @rusackas @junlincc\r\n\r\n@villebro Can you check the sort option to see if we need additional changes to it? \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen running the following command:\r\n\r\n    superset import-datasources --path=datasource.json\r\n\r\nthe data stored in \"datasources.json\" may either be dict or a list. In the case\r\nof a dataset exported from a live superset instance, it is a list. When it is\r\nre-imported, the `SqlaTable.import_from_dict` utility method is used. This\r\nmethod does not commit changes to the database, so the imported datasets are\r\nnever saved to the database, causing frustration and sadness.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create and export dataset\r\n2. Change the name of the dataset in the exported file\r\n3. Re-import dataset\r\n \r\nPrior to the fix, the new dataset is not created.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `/api/v1/database/available/` endpoint:\r\n\r\n1. For each DB engine spec, also show the list of installed drivers (eg, `mysqldb` and `mysqlconnector` for MySQL, in my system).\r\n2. For each DB, show the default driver if available (eg, `mysqldb` for MySQL).\r\n3. Only show the parameters if the default driver is installed (eg, if `mysqldb` is not installed but `mysqlconector` is, don't show the parameters for MySQL).\r\n\r\nThe reason for (3) is that if the user doesn't have the default driver installed we can't enable SSL for them. For example, for MySQL the engine spec can only enable it for the default `mysqldb` driver ([see](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/mysql.py#L66)).\r\n\r\nIf the user wants to use the non-default driver they need to use the old method via the SQLAlchemy URI. In that case we don't show the `parameters` for the engine spec, so that the modal should only allow the DB to be configured via the URI.\r\n\r\n(1) and (2) will not be used by the modal, but are useful for debugging and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
