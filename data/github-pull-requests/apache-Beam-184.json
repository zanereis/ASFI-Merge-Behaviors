key handling code in ExecutableStageDoFnOperator was a bit hard to\r\nunderstand because of the different contexts in which the current key is\r\nset. This simplifies the key setting by always using the state backend to set\r\nthe key. An additional guard has been added to ensure that no concurrent access\r\nis performed during key access.\r\n\r\nThis also adds an additional class for consistent use of key coders.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

the version tag to use for the Google Container Registry,\r\nfor the service image versions to use on the Dataflow worker nodes.\r\nUsers of Dataflow may be using a locally-modified version of\r\nApache Beam, which they submit to Dataflow with the\r\n--sdk_location option. Those users would most likely modify the\r\nversion number of Apache Beam, so they can distinguish it from the\r\npublic distribution of Apache Beam.\r\nHowever, the remote nodes in Dataflow still need to bootsrap the\r\nworker service with a Docker image that a version tag exists for.\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate way for system integrators to modify the\r\nApache Beam version number would be to add a Local Version Identifier:\r\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers\r\n\r\nIf people only use Local Version Identifiers, then we could use\r\nthe \"public\" attribute of the pkg_resources version object.\r\n\r\nIf people instead use a post-release version identifier:\r\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#post-releases\r\nthen only the \"base_version\" attribute would work both of these\r\nversion number changes.\r\n\r\nSince Dataflow documentation does not specify how to modify\r\nversion numbers, I am choosing to use \"base_version\" attribute.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Python apache_beam.io.filesystem module has a bug handling concatenated compressed files.\r\n\r\nThis PR has two commits:\r\n\r\n1. a new unit test that shows the problem\r\n2. a fix to the problem.\r\n\r\nThe unit test is added to the apache_beam.io.filesystem_test module. It was added to this module because the test: apache_beam.io.textio_test.test_read_gzip_concat does not encounter the problem in the Beam 2.11 and earlier code base because the test data is too small: the data is smaller than read_size, so it goes through logic in the code that avoids the problem in the code. So, this test sets read_size smaller and test data bigger, in order to encounter the problem. It would be difficult to test in the textio_test module, because you'd need very large test data because default read_size is 16MiB, and the ReadFromText interface does not allow you to modify the read_size.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

size increase into account\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been running into this problem when publishing messages with pubsubIO:\r\n```Request payload size exceeds the limit: 10485760 bytes.\"```\r\n\r\nAfter looking into the source code I see that the default max batch size is 10MB. This however does not take into account the size increase of base64 encoding the messages after the flush. Base64 encodes each set of three bytes into four bytes.\r\n\r\nTherefore the 'true' size limit placed on the unencoded batch should be\r\nx = ((10 * 1024 * 1024) / 4) * 3 = 7864320 bytes\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

all,\r\n\r\nHere is the PR for an initial version of CouchbaseIO. Currently, the read part has been accomplished. In general, the idea is to read the data by using a set of sources which is supposed to read a portion of data according to the key range. Knowing that Couchbase does not provide the feature of splitting up a bucket. So firstly I fetch the total number of keys and then divide the key range by the number of threads. Each source will be attributed a part of key range so that a whole set of sources can do a parallel read. \r\nI'm looking forward to the review. Thanks!

It was decided to stick to current design and add a new monitoring\r\ninfo type for distribution metric.\r\n\r\n2. Updated python harness to report new metric urn.\r\n\r\n3. Added UserDistributionMetric transformer to java. It is similar to\r\nuser metric transformer, but it is not worth to complicate code much\r\nas of now.\r\n\r\n4. Refactoring of code will be done in further commits.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR implements a prototype for a Spark portable runner.\r\n- This work follows the Flink runner's example very closely.\r\n- I chose to build this on top of the more stable and fully-featured legacy Spark runner rather than developing concurrently with the structured streaming branch. Therefore, RDDs are used rather than Datasets.\r\n- This iteration implements and tests Impulse, Executable Stage, and GBK. Note that the GBK translation is mostly identical to the legacy runner.\r\n- PAssert is not yet working (because metrics are not supported). However, `SparkPortableExecutionTest` is able to informally verify that the executable stage consumes and outputs elements correctly with a print statement.\r\n- For now, streaming, side inputs, user state/timers, metrics, etc. are not supported. Side inputs are next on my road map.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka, @robertwb, @iemejia \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

came to my attention that the Go SDK had no way of explicitly triggering known beam coders (in particular, varint64). I checked with Java and Python, and it's apparent that by default, int64s (longs) use the known varint encoding for this datatype, so this change brings this into parity.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Go SDK was limiting it's use of varints to 32 bits only, which isn't done in the other SDKs. \r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n  * Makes the varint coder explicitly 64 bits, instead of 32 bits.\r\n  * Makes int64s use the known varint coder for beam, allowing runners better knowledge of the data, where applicable.\r\n      * Other numeric types will continue to use CustomCoders (which are then length prefixed for compatibility), unless I hear direction otherwise.\r\n   * Updates the StandardCoder proto documentation for the varint urn, to make it's assumed 64bit-ness explicit.\r\n\r\nI'd have liked to make all integers use varint, but the reality is that no subcomponents are permitted for beam's varint, so there's no where to put specific type information the SDK can gleam to produce the correct type right out of the gate. This is particular to Go where int's must be explicitly converted, rather than implicitly. Given the conversion step would be more expensive than the present LP+CustomCoder usage, this asymmetry is the best we can do for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
