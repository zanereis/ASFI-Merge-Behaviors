Attribute support in computation graph\n  - Now user can use attributes to give various hints about specific learning rate, allocation plans etc\n- MXNet is more memory efficient\n  - Support user defined memory optimization with attributes\n- Support mobile applications by @antinucleon\n- Refreshed update of new documents\n- Model parallel training of LSTM by @tqchen\n- Simple operator refactor by @tqchen\n  - add operator_util.h to enable quick registration of both ndarray and symbolic ops\n- Distributed training by @mli\n- Support Torch Module by @piiswrong\n  - MXNet now can use any of the modules from Torch.\n- Support custom native operator by @piiswrong\n- Support data types including fp16, fp32, fp64, int32, and uint8 by @piiswrong\n- Support monitor for easy printing and debugging by @piiswrong\n- Support new module API by @pluskid\n  - Module API is a middle level API that can be used in imperative manner like Torch-Module\n- Support bucketing API for variable length input by @pluskid\n- Support CuDNN v5 by @antinucleon\n- More applications\n  - Speech recoginition by @yzhang87\n  - [Neural art](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/example/neural-style) by
