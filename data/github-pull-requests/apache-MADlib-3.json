commit adds a new function to train multiple models in parallel\r\nwith model hopping method.\r\n\r\nModel hopping method involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n- Train models in parallel for a single epoch using the data local\r\nto each segment.\r\n- Move the models to the next segment in round-robin fashion.\r\n\r\nThis method ensures that all of the models visit the entitre dataset,\r\nwhich eliminates the need to average the model at the end.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes an issue with the regular fit function where\r\nexcessive amounts of threads were being created and left over by

MADLIB-1327\r\nAssocation rules was slow due to a blow up in number of candidate\r\nitemsets before checking for their support and graduating them to\r\nfrequent itemsets. This PR changes ensures the candidate itemsets are\r\nordered, and only a few consecutive itemsets must be considered to merge\r\nand create a new candidate itemset for checking support. This also\r\nreduces the result of a join query significantly (previously, the result\r\nof the join were all potential candidates, which were redundant and\r\nwhich may have resulted in itemsets that were larger than what was\r\nconsidered in the current iteration).\r\nThis commit also adds relevant tests in dev-check.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Orhan Kislal

MADLIB-1301\r\nWhile deconstructing the correlation matrix to create the output table,\r\na big UNION ALL query was created, with one sub-query for each distinct\r\ngrouping value. This was causing the memory, stack, and performance\r\nrelated issues.\r\nThe fix is to run multiple queries, with each query processing the\r\ndeconstruction of the correlation matrix for a limited number of\r\ngroups (we have defaulted the value to 10). This value can be\r\nparameterized by the user with a newly introduced optional parameter\r\nnamed `n_groups_per_run` for both correlation and covariance.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Orhan Kislal

MADLIB-1361\r\n\r\nWith large datasets, pivot fails because of the array_agg(distinct)\r\nquery. This is because array_agg collects the values first and filters\r\nthe distinct values later. This causes the array_agg to go out of\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by separating distinct from array_agg.\r\nWe use a subquery to get the distinct values. Then we aggregate these\r\nvalues using array_agg.\r\n\r\nCloses #413\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ekta Khanna

MADLIB-1358\r\n\r\nUnder deep_learning module (this includes preprocessor, keras model arch\r\ntable, fit, evaluate and predict), we made the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. independent_var and normalizing const to be float32 (REAL).\r\n2. dependent_var to be a 16-bit integer (SMALLINT)\r\n\r\nWe were previously converting independent_var to float64 which is not\r\nnecessary at all. Instead we might be able to save resources by just\r\nusing float32 for the independent_var and int16 for the one hot encoded\r\ndependent_var.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Nikhil Kak

MADLIB-1356\r\n\r\nCurrently for postgres, we create one keras session in\r\nfit/evaluate/predict and keep it open for all the iterations and then\r\nclose it at the end.  We did a few experiments and found out that if we\r\ncreate 1 keras session per iteration , it performs slightly better.\r\nSo this commit modifies the code to make pg behave the same as gpdb(1\r\nsession per iteration) in fit_transition, eval_transition and\r\ninternal_predict functions.\r\n\r\nWe also changed set_keras_session to use a device_name to be consistent\r\nwith other keras operations.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes the following bug: \r\nIf gpus are available on the\r\nhost but the user passed in 0 for the gpus_per_host param, we still end\r\nup using gpu memory. This is because in the madlib_keras.fit UDF we call\r\nmodel.get_weights() to initialize the model and this function ends up\r\nusing gpu(s) if there are any available.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored some image count related

adds `std::*` to the list of symbols defined in madlib\r\nthat should be hidden from external libraries by the linker.  (Also added\r\ncomments to existing mangled symbols with unmangled version for\r\nreadability.)\r\n\r\nThis fixes several intermittent crashes that were happening in the\r\n`deep_learning` module in different forms on different platforms, due to\r\ntensorflow calling madlib's instantiation of STL template functions,\r\nwhich circumvents the hiding of madlib's global new and delete symbols\r\n(intended to override the `libstdc++` version of these symbols for all\r\nof `libmadlib.so`, but not for anything outside of it).\r\n\r\nThe main crash we looked at was due to the use of `std::set<string>` in\r\n`madlib/src/modules/linalg/metric.cpp`.  Tensorflow is a python library,\r\nbut it loads Google's C++ protobuf library `_message.so`.  The crash was\r\nhappening because `_message.so` also uses `std::set<string>` for some\r\nthings, and it ends up calling madlib's instationation of them.  We were\r\nable to fix it by hiding all madlib symbols associated with the `std::set<string`\r\nclass, but this just resulted in a similar crash happening instead because of a\r\ndifferent STL symbol exposed by madlib.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we should move to hiding all symbols by default\r\nand explicitly make exceptions for madlib API functions.

   This adds `std::*` to the list of symbols defined in madlib\r\n    that should be hidden from external libraries by the linker.\r\n\r\n    This fixes several intermittent crashes that were happening in the\r\n    `deep_learning` module in different forms on different platforms, due to\r\n    tensorflow calling madlib's instantiation of STL template functions,\r\n    which circumvents the hiding of madlib's global new and delete symbols\r\n    (intended to override the `libstdc++` version of these symbols for all\r\n    of `libmadlib.so`, but not for anything outside of it).\r\n\r\n    The main crash we looked at was due to the use of `std::set<string>` in\r\n    `madlib/src/modules/linalg/metric.cpp`.  Tensorflow is a python library,\r\n    but it loads Google's C++ protobuf library `_message.so`.  The crash was\r\n    happening because `_message.so` also uses `std::set<string>` for some\r\n    things, and it ends up calling madlib's instationation of them.  We were\r\n    able to fix it by hiding all madlib symbols associated with the `std::set<string`\r\n    class, but this just resulted in a similar crash happening instead because of a\r\n    different STL symbol exposed by madlib.\r\n\r\n    In the long term, we should move to hiding all symbols by default\r\n    and explicitly make exceptions for madlib API functions.  But this would\r\n    be a bigger change and require more extensive testing to make sure it\r\n    doesn't cause any obscure issues on any platform.  So for now we are just\r\n    hiding those in namespace std.","created_at":"2019-06-04T22:45:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T19:14:12Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T00:32:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad475eac77d6a7f44747d7df66c65f5a1fe98dac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/9110be4382a2e1f04126cd16535abda69c623f0a","head":{"label":"reductionista:crash_fix","ref":"crash_fix","sha":"9110be4382a2e1f04126cd16535abda69c623f0a","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

Permitted values are `balanced`, a mapping of the form `{key:value}`,\r\nempty string.\r\n2. Keys in a mapping must be legitimate class labels in the source\r\ntable.\r\n3. Values in a mapping must be numbers.\r\n4. There has to be at least one key-value and at most 2 key-value pairs.\r\n\r\nThis PR still does not address the issue of having special characters in\r\nclass levels used in a mapping.

MADLIB-1340\r\n\r\nIn buffer size calculator, we assumed the array to be packed is one dimention, and use the array_upper(x, 1) to get the length\r\nof the array. In DL input data preprocessor, we passed the first element\r\nin array_ndims as the length, which is not right because the\r\narray can be multi-dimentional. This caused\r\ndefault_buffer_size_calculator returns a bigger buffer size than it\r\nsupposed to have and rows get too big and crashes database.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should use\r\nproduct of all the elements from array_ndims to represent the actual length of\r\nthe array. For example, if array_ndims returns [32,32,3], we should pass\r\n32*32*3 instead of 32. This commit fixes this issue by passing the\r\nright length to defualt buffer calculator.","created_at":"2019-05-30T00:56:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T21:05:44Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T21:05:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"121c0ad280c6b4c03826993e0d9589c244a678fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/f8237b8706a3ef88cb40a2c3c0f8008434203c8a","head":{"label":"madlib:dl-fix-buffer-size","ref":"dl-fix-buffer-size","sha":"f8237b8706a3ef88cb40a2c3c0f8008434203c8a","user":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45948574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTk0ODU3NA==","name":"madlib","full_name":"madlib/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/madlib/madlib","description":"Mirror

DL: Add model_weights, name and desc to the model arch table.\r\n\r\nJIRA: MADLIB-1348\r\n\r\nThis commit adds three optional params to the model arch interface.\r\n1. model weights in bytea format\r\n2. name\r\n3. description\r\n\r\nThe model_weights param will allow the user to load pre trained weights\r\nto enable transfer learning\r\n\r\n1. Remove image count from the serialized model weights that get stored\r\nin the model output table. This image count was unnecessary and also\r\ncaused inconsistency in the model weights format in model_arch and\r\nkeras fit model out table.\r\n2. Use bytea to store/read model weights. This includes the input param\r\nand output col type. Here is why\r\n  a. we found that in python, using double precision[] or real[] was\r\n  almost double in size as compared to bytea.\r\n  b. It also helps keep the internal state of the model and the output to\r\n  the user consistent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally\r\n1. Use plpy prepare to format the model weights as bytea.\r\n2. Modify the deserialize code to accept a bytea string\r\ninstead of a double precision[]\r\n3. Modify madpack code so that install check user can create python\r\nUDFs in the madlib keras dev check sql.\r\n4. Add dev check test to test for transfer learning by creating a UDF\r\nthat calls the load_arch_table with some pre defined weights so that the\r\nfirst iteration of fit always returns the same loss and metric.\r\n5. Rename serializer functions to be more reflective of their purpose.\r\n6. Move model_shapes to wrapper and remove model_shapes from SD\r\n7. Rename model_state to either state or serialized_weights depending on\r\nits content.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-25T00:14:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T22:10:32Z","closed_at":"2019-05-29T22:10:32Z","merged_at":"2019-05-29T22:10:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7ff51b020fe405ca829c3ed7cdbbe411bc6365e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/b7ff51b020fe405ca829c3ed7cdbbe411bc6365e","head":{"label":"kaknikhil:dl-transfer-learning","ref":"dl-transfer-learning","sha":"b7ff51b020fe405ca829c3ed7cdbbe411bc6365e","user":{"login":"kaknikhil","id":11729207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzI5MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11729207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaknikhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107308174,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDczMDgxNzQ=","name":"madlib","full_name":"kaknikhil/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaknikhil","id":11729207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzI5MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11729207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaknikhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaknikhil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaknikhil/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1343\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements\r\n1. Using SD to cache the model and set the weights only once for the\r\nfirst row for each segment. This also meant that we had to clear the SD\r\nfor the last row for each segment.\r\n\r\n2. We replaced `PythonFunctionBodyOnly` with\r\n`PythonFunctionBodyOnlyNoSchema` in the internal keras predict sql.\r\nUsing `PythonFunctionBodyOnly` made the query much slower because it\r\nadded the overhead of executing the schema query for every row in the\r\ntest table. We don't really need to know the schema name for the\r\ninternal UDF so now we use `PythonFunctionBodyOnlyNoSchema` instead.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n1. Replace the use of predict_classes and proba with predict since non\r\nsequential models do not support predict_classes.\r\n2. Modify the internal keras predict query to not join the test table\r\nand the model table because it caused weird inconsistencies with\r\nthe segment id due to which SD was not getting set/cleared properly.\r\n3. Add try catch in the internal predict UDF so that we can clear out\r\nthe SD in case of an error.\r\n4.

PR for reference https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/379\r\n\r\nJIRA: MADLIB-1308\r\n\r\nPreviously, gpus_per_host were hard coded to 4. This commit removes this\r\nhard coding and takes in this value from the user.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to use the tensorflow function list_local_devices to get\r\nthe count of gpus per host. This did give us the count but would hang\r\nforever on some segments. So we decided to not use this function.\r\n\r\nWe now cache the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES env variable (which is set to\r\n-1 for master) and then reset it at the end of fit function.\r\n\r\nFinally, we dynamically calculate the gpu memory fraction to support\r\nthe case when the number of gpus is less than the number of segments.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug in get device name function for postgres\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-02T19:05:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T20:47:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-06T17:47:12Z","merged_at":"2019-05-06T17:47:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c1f737f6991868167af780b269aa2fc029a5369","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/6c1f737f6991868167af780b269aa2fc029a5369","head":{"label":"madlib:dl/remove-hardcode","ref":"dl/remove-hardcode","sha":"6c1f737f6991868167af780b269aa2fc029a5369","user":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45948574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTk0ODU3NA==","name":"madlib","full_name":"madlib/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/madlib/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1324\r\nPreviously, the name/value of 'dependent_varname' and 'indenpendent_varname'\r\nin madlib_keras_fit() is a bit confusing. This commit does the following:\r\n\r\n1. remove dependent_varname and independent_varname from the fit()\r\ninterface since we know what these are from the minibatch summary table,\r\nand user must use minibatching for DL\r\n2. use original column names from the source table (i.e., pre minibatch) in\r\nfit summary table, not the generic names dependent_var and independent_var\r\n3. This change will also change the predict summary table to have the\r\noriginal column names instead of dependent_var and

MADLIB-1333\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n1) Rename minibatch_preprocessor_dl to training_preprocessor_dl.\r\n2) Code refactoring to move it from utilities module to deep_learning.\r\n3) Add a new function named validation_preprocessor_dl that can be used\r\nto preprocess validation data. The independent var in validation data is\r\nminibatched and normalized while the dependent var is 1-hot encoded. We\r\ndo not distribute the minibatched data randomly, since this data is only\r\nused for evaluation and not training.\r\n4) Necessary changes to get existing tests to green.\r\n5) Dev check tests.\r\n6) User and online doc

MADLIB-1308\r\n\r\nPreviously, gpus_per_host were hard coded to 4. This commit removes this\r\nhard coding and takes in this value from the user.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to use the tensorflow function `list_local_devices` to get\r\nthe count of gpus per host. This did give us the count but would hang\r\nforever on some segments. So we decided to not use this function.\r\n\r\nWe now cache the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES env variable (which is set to\r\n-1 for master) and then reset it at the end of fit function.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug  in get device name function for postgres\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-30T00:05:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-01T21:41:48Z","closed_at":"2019-05-01T21:41:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4a3efcdd98582f3537816910dc5ea4ca520a42d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/8638f2d7b32a7271aed0d5cdbbdf8882e044a0bf","head":{"label":"madlib:dl/remove-hardcode","ref":"dl/remove-hardcode","sha":"8638f2d7b32a7271aed0d5cdbbdf8882e044a0bf","user":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45948574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTk0ODU3NA==","name":"madlib","full_name":"madlib/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/madlib/madlib","description":"Mirror

MADLIB-1310\r\n\r\nPreviously, while merging the weights, accuracy and loss, we\r\nassume that all the buffers are of the same size. This may not be always\r\nthe case.  Ideally we should use the total no of images per segment to\r\naverage the weights, accuracy and loss.\r\nThis commit, updates the transition, merge and final function for\r\n`madlib_keras_fit()` to use the number of images on a segment instead of\r\nthe buffer count for averaging weights, accuracy and loss.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the function `deserialize_weights()` when deserializing\r\nloss and accuracy from state, type-casted it to an int, which resulted\r\nin computing lower loss and accuracy while training. This PR also\r\naddresses this issue.","created_at":"2019-04-26T00:03:50Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T19:39:47Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T19:39:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b0cf6d8fd4f43068699a18aff2e4f0c1964e41a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/32233694b569f370f45d6746e85e151dfdfeeee4","head":{"label":"reductionista:dl/merge-by-images","ref":"dl/merge-by-images","sha":"32233694b569f370f45d6746e85e151dfdfeeee4","user":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178961560,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg5NjE1NjA=","name":"madlib","full_name":"reductionista/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reductionista","id":2644901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQ5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista","html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reductionista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reductionista/madlib","description":"Mirror

Use FORMAT class for getting model_arch col names(previously it was hardcoded, which caused discrepancy between minibatch_preprocessor_dl() and madlib_keras_fit()).\r\n6.

PR improves performance for weakly connected components module.\r\n\r\nPrior to this update, `madlib. weakly_connected_components()` used the edge \r\ntable in join clauses with both `src` and `dest` columns.\r\nThis PR updates the query on the message table such that the JOIN\r\nalways operates on the column that the table is distributed on. To this\r\nend, we duplicate the edge table to distribute it on the dest column.\r\nThis separation of accesses reduces the redistribute motion on greenplum.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we split the `UNION ALL` query to ensure that the working set\r\nis limited with very large graphs.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes IC/DC check to include wcc

won't support deep learning on gpdb 4.3 because\r\n1. Deep learning requires the type 'JSON' which isn't supported in gpdb\r\n4.3.\r\n2. Our deep learning module depends on tensorflow to be pre installed.\r\nGPDB 4.3 ships with python 2.6.9 which doesn't support tensorflow.\r\n\r\nmadpack currently looks for Modules.yml first in\r\n\"src/ports/portid/dbver/config\" and then in src/config. This commit\r\ncopies the custom Modules.yml in the src/ports/portid/dbver/config/ dir.\r\nWe use a custom Modules.yml file for gpdb 4.3 which is just a copy of\r\nthe existing Modules.yml

 MADLIB-1303\r\nThis PR adds one-hot encode to minibatch preprocessor DL class. The one-hot encode applies to all types: boolean and character types such as text, char and varchar, & integers and floats. If the dependent variable is already an array, then we assume it is already one-hot encoded and we just cast it to int[] and pass it along.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the param `dependent_offset (optional)` from the current interface since one-hot encoding is the more general solution.\r\n\r\nBesides, a column named `class_values` is added to output summary table to reflect the one-hot encoding categories.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ekta Khanna

PR introduces two new helper functions, `load_keras_model()` and `delete_keras_model()`.  It is a part of the new deep learning functionality being added to madlib.\r\n\r\nThese functions will help prepare the input to the `keras_fit()` function being introduced in PR [#355](https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/355).\r\n\r\n`keras_fit()` takes a model_arch_table param and a model_id param.  This refers to a row in a \"keras model arch table\" which has to have a particular format.  These functions will help the user to create and manage that table, without worrying about the details of the format.\r\n\r\nEach row of the keras model arch table represents a keras model architecture, and is identified by a model_id.  `load_keras_model()` will add a new model architecture to the table, creating the table if it doesn't exist and then inserting the appropriate row into it.  The newly assigned model_id will be printed for the user, who can then pass that as the model_id parameter to `keras_fit()`.\r\n\r\nThe model architectures themselves are expected to be in JSON format, which can be achieved by calling `model.to_json()` on any keras model after it is created (in python).\r\n\r\nThe keras model arch table also has a column to store weights.  This is initialized to `null` by `load_keras_model()` but we plan to add another helper function in the near future to be able to set the weights (useful for doing a warm start, instead of letting keras randomly initialize the weights when training begins).\r\n\r\nThe keras model arch table itself will be automatically dropped by `delete_keras_model()` after all of the models in it are deleted and the table is empty.\r\n\r\nTo help avoid mistakes, if either of these functions is run on a table that doesn't match the expected format, and exception will be thrown and the table will be left untouched.","created_at":"2019-03-14T20:33:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T00:45:51Z","closed_at":"2019-03-20T00:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5746ee93399e18fc33d2f310081996b02d7493a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/statuses/50160823d0b0ab9667223d9904a03fa8f1f32870","head":{"label":"madlib:dl_helper_functions","ref":"dl_helper_functions","sha":"50160823d0b0ab9667223d9904a03fa8f1f32870","user":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45948574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTk0ODU3NA==","name":"madlib","full_name":"madlib/madlib","private":false,"owner":{"login":"madlib","id":377562,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM3NzU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib","html_url":"https://github.com/madlib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madlib/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/madlib/madlib","description":"Mirror

Module: Deep Learning support with Keras\r\n\r\nThis is an introductory commit to supporting Deep Learning in MADlib.\r\nThe goal of this feature is to make it easy for data scientists to\r\ndevelop models using deep learning on data residing in\r\nPostgres/Greenplum database. We do not want users to have to move their\r\ndata from their database to another place in order to do deep learning.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation stands with the following requirements:\r\n- The database host has Tensorflow and Keras set up.\r\n- Users must use MADlib's minibatch_preprocessor_dl() module to\r\n  pre-process their data, since this module expects the data to be in\r\n  the format output by minibatch_preprocessor_dl().\r\n- The model architecture is expected to be stored in a different table,\r\n  which is passed along as a param to this module.\r\n- If there are no GPUs in the host, the use_gpu param must be set to\r\n  false while calling this module.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of hard assumptions that we make, which must be\r\naddressed in other JIRAs (not a complete list).\r\nTODO JIRAs:\r\n- Postgres support for Deep learning ().\r\n- There is a hard assumption regarding the number of GPUs per host,\r\n  which should be fixed as part of another JIRA ().\r\n- Documentation for the module ().\r\n- Generalize and refactor predict.\r\n
