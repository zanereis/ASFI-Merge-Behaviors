For more high-level description, and notes on future work, refer to #17139.\r\n\r\nThis patch contains the following changes, grouped into packages.\r\n\r\nController (org.apache.druid.msq.dart.controller):\r\n\r\nThe controller runs on Brokers. Main classes are,\r\n\r\n- DartSqlResource, which serves /druid/v2/sql/dart/.\r\n- DartSqlEngine and DartQueryMaker, the entry points from SQL that actually run the MSQ controller code.\r\n- DartControllerContext, which configures the MSQ controller.\r\n- DartMessageRelays, which sets up relays (see \"message relays\" below) to read messages from workers' DartControllerClients.\r\n- DartTableInputSpecSlicer, which assigns work based on a TimelineServerView.\r\n\r\nWorker (org.apache.druid.msq.dart.worker)\r\n\r\nThe worker runs on Historicals. Main classes are,\r\n\r\n- DartWorkerResource, which supplies the regular MSQ WorkerResource, plus Dart-specific APIs.\r\n- DartWorkerRunner, which runs MSQ worker code.\r\n- DartWorkerContext, which configures the MSQ worker.\r\n- DartProcessingBuffersProvider, which provides processing buffers from sliced-up merge buffers.\r\n- DartDataSegmentProvider, which provides segments from the Historical's local cache.\r\n\r\nMessage relays (org.apache.druid.messages):\r\n\r\nTo avoid the need for Historicals to contact Brokers during a query, which would create opportunities for queries to get stuck, all connections are opened from Broker to Historical. This is made possible by a message relay system, where the relay server (worker) has an outbox of messages.\r\n\r\nThe relay client (controller) connects to the outbox and retrieves messages. Code for this system lives in the \"server\" package to keep it separate from the MSQ extension and make it easier to maintain. The worker-to-controller ControllerClient is implemented using message relays.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Controller: Added the method \"hasWorker\". Used by the ControllerMessageListener to notify the appropriate controllers when a worker fails.\r\n- WorkerResource: No longer tries to respond more than once in the \"httpGetChannelData\" API. This comes up when a response due to resolved future is ready at about the same time as a timeout occurs.\r\n- MSQTaskQueryMaker: Refactor to separate out some useful functions for reuse in DartQueryMaker.\r\n- SqlEngine: Add \"queryContext\" to \"resultTypeForSelect\" and \"resultTypeForInsert\". This allows the DartSqlEngine to modify result format based on whether a \"fullReport\" context parameter is set.\r\n- LimitedOutputStream: New utility class. Used when in \"fullReport\" mode.\r\n- TimelineServerView: Add getDruidServerMetadata as a performance optimization.\r\n- CliHistorical: Add SegmentWrangler, so it can query inline data, lookups, etc.\r\n- ServiceLocation: Add \"fromUri\" method, relocating some code from ServiceClientImpl.\r\n- FixedServiceLocator: New locator for a fixed set of service locations. Useful for URI locations.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

can be instructed to exit before they finish, especially when a downstream stage includes a \"LIMIT\". This patch has improvements related to early-exiting stages.\r\n\r\nBug fix:\r\n\r\n- WorkerStageKernel: Don't allow fail() to set an exception if the stage is already in a terminal state (FINISHED or FAILED). If fail() is called while in a terminal state, log the exception, then throw it away. If it's a cancellation exception, don't even log it. This fixes a bug where a stage that exited early could transition to FINISHED and then to FAILED, causing the overall query to fail.\r\n\r\nPerformance:\r\n\r\n- DartWorkerManager previously sent stopWorker commands to workers even when \"interrupt\" was false. Now it only sends those commands when \"interrupt\" is true. The method javadoc already claimed this is what the method did, but the implementation did not match the javadoc. This reduces the number of RPCs by 1 per worker per query.\r\n\r\nQuieter logging:\r\n\r\n- In ReadableByteChunksFrameChannel, skip logging exception from setError if the channel has been closed. Channels are closed when readers are done with them, so at that point, we wouldn't be interested in the errors.\r\n\r\n- In RunWorkOrder, skip calling notifyListener on failure of the main work, in the case when stop() has already been called. The stop() method will set its own error using CanceledFault. This enables callers to detect when a stage was canceled vs. failed for some other reason.\r\n\r\n- In WorkerStageKernel, skip logging cancellation errors in fail(). This is made possible by the previous change in RunWorkOrder.","created_at":"2024-10-03T05:46:13Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T14:39:02Z","closed_at":"2024-10-03T14:39:02Z","merged_at":"2024-10-03T14:39:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"db7cc4634c5df247376e251fb1f502cfc7ae934d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThis PR aims to change the behavior of the druid lookups-cached-single extension. In fact, we aim to introduce the option to iterate over fetched data from the dataFetcher. We need this in the case of loadingLookups, that's why these changes don't impact the pollingLookup feature.\r\nI also added the handling of a use case where the data exists in Druid but not in the actual data fetcher, which is in our use-case JDBC Data fetcher.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nSupport iterating over fetched data for the loadinglookups for the druid lookups-cached-single extension\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Support iterating over fetched data for the loadinglookups for the druid lookups-cached-single extension`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes the scenarios where we had all window functions with some `partition by` clause. Currently, we were triggering another run of `runIncrementally()` on every `partition by` change. But this is unnecessary overhead. This PR changes the behavior to only trigger a re-run when we write a frame to the output channel.\r\n\r\nFor example, the below query that processes almost 50M rows was run with `maxNumTasks=2` against the current master code vs this PR's code.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect c1, count(c1) from (select trip_id, row_number() over(partition by trip_id) as c1 from \"trips_xaa\" where __time < TIMESTAMP '2016-10-20 11:15:25' group by trip_id) group by c1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see in the following screenshots that the window stage took `5:37 minutes` in the current master code compared to `35 seconds` with this PR's code, making the overall query time to go down from 23 minutes to 18 minutes.\r\n\r\nCurrent master code             |  This PR's code\r\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d38bc1a3-6826-4704-be15-a85981a07bb2)  |  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/705d72aa-b7f7-4e5b-aa5b-2173c0b26d53)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This enables queries to hold processing buffers without blocking other concurrently-running queries. Changes:\r\n\r\n- Introduce ProcessingBuffersSet and ProcessingBuffers to hold the per-worker and per-work-order processing buffers (respectively). On Peons, this is the JVM-wide processing pool. On Indexers, this is a per-worker pool of on-heap buffers. (This change fixes a bug on Indexers where excessive processing buffers could be used if MSQ tasks ran concurrently with realtime tasks.)\r\n\r\n- Add \"bufferPool\" argument to GroupingEngine#process so a per-worker pool can be passed in.\r\n\r\n- Add \"druid.msq.task.memory.maxThreads\" property, which controls the maximum number of processing threads to use per task. This allows usage of multiple processing buffers per task if admins desire.\r\n\r\n- IndexerWorkerContext acquires processingBuffers when creating the FrameContext for a work order, and releases them when closing the FrameContext.\r\n\r\n- Add \"usesProcessingBuffers()\" to FrameProcessorFactory so workers know how many sets of processing buffers are needed to run a given query.\r\n\r\nSecond, adjustments to how WorkerMemoryParameters slices up bundles, to favor more memory for sorting and segment generation. Changes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of using same-sized bundles for processing and for sorting, workers now use minimally-sized processing bundles (just enough to read inputs plus a little overhead). The rest is devoted to broadcast data buffering, sorting, and segment-building.\r\n\r\n- Segment-building is now limited to 1 concurrent segment per work order. This allows each segment-building action to use more memory. Note that segment-building is internally multi-threaded to a degree. (Build and persist can run concurrently.)\r\n\r\n- Simplify frame size calculations by removing the distinction between \"standard\" and \"large\" frames. The new default frame size is the same as the old \"standard\" frames, 1 MB. The original goal of of the large frames was to reduce the number of temporary files during sorting, but I think we can achieve the same thing by simply merging a larger number of standard frames at once.\r\n\r\n- Remove the small worker adjustment that was added in #14117 to account for an extra frame involved in writing to durable storage. Instead, account for the extra frame whenever we are actually using durable storage.\r\n\r\n- Cap super-sorter parallelism using the number of output partitions, rather than using a hard coded cap at 4. Note that in practice, so far, this cap has not been relevant for tasks because they have only been using a single processing thread anyway.\r\n\r\n* Remove unused import.\r\n\r\n* Fix errorprone annotation.\r\n\r\n* Fixes for javadocs and inspections.\r\n\r\n* Additional test coverage.\r\n\r\n* Fix test.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, we had a bug in the `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` where the frame writer's capacity could get reached for larger queries, causing it to not output all of the result rows.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following query gives incomplete output rows when we use `maxNumTasks=2`, compared to when we use more workers.\r\n```sql\r\nselect trip_id, row_number() over(partition by trip_id) as c1 from \"trips_xaa\" where __time < TIMESTAMP '2013-09-20 11:15:25' group by trip_id\r\n-- This gives 20479 rows with maxNumTasks=2\r\n-- This gives 30341 rows with maxNumTasks=5\r\n-- This gives 30341 rows with maxNumTasks=11\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue by maintaining the state of `last rowId flushed to output channel`, and triggering another iteration of `runIncrementally()` method if frame writer has rows pending flush to the output channel.\r\n\r\nThe above is done keeping in mind `FrameProcessor`'s contract which enforces that we should write only a single frame to each output channel in any given iteration of `runIncrementally()`.\r\n\r\nFor manual testing, I've been verifying the behavior with queries like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nselect trip_id, row_number() over(partition by trip_id) as c1 from \"trips_xaa\" where __time < TIMESTAMP '2016-10-20 11:15:25' group by trip_id\r\n-- 49795247 rows inputted, 49795247 rows outputted by window stage (with maxNumTasks=2 and maxNumTasks=11)\r\n\r\nselect c1, count(c1) from (select trip_id, row_number() over(partition by trip_id) as c1 from \"trips_xaa\" where __time < TIMESTAMP '2016-10-20 11:15:25' group by trip_id) group by c1\r\n-- [1, 49795247] with maxNumTasks=2 and maxNumTasks=11\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have added a test `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessorTest#testFrameWriterReachingCapacity()` which was previously writing less number of rows to the output channel, but is writing the complete set of rows.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n-

control the loading of broadcast datasources via BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec getBroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec(). By default, tasks download all broadcast datasources, unless there's an override as with kill and MSQ controller task.\r\n\r\nThe CLIPeon command line option --loadBroadcastSegments is deprecated in favor of --loadBroadcastDatasourceMode.\r\n\r\nBroadcast datasources can be specified in SQL queries through JOIN and FROM clauses, or obtained from other sources such as lookups.To this effect, we have introduced a BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec. Finding the set of broadcast datasources during SQL planning will be done in a follow-up, which will apply only to MSQ tasks, so they load only required broadcast datasources. This PR primarily focuses on the skeletal changes around BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec and integrating it from the Task interface via CliPeon to SegmentBootstrapper.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only kill tasks and MSQ controller tasks skip loading broadcast datasources.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

CursorHolder.isPreAggregated method indicates that a cursor has pre-aggregated data for all AggregatorFactory specified in a CursorBuildSpec. If true, engines should rewrite the query to use AggregatorFactory.getCombiningAggreggator, and column selector factories will provide selectors with the aggregator interediate type for the aggregator factory name\r\n* Added groupby, timeseries, and topN support for CursorHolder.isPreAggregated\r\n* Added synthetic test since no CursorHolder implementations support isPreAggregated at this point in time\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAdds a verbose column tracking metric to DefaultQueryMetrics. This metric would track which columns the query touched when fetching the results. By nature, this can be very verbose so by default it is disabled and it is left to the extension to override with their own implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

These aggregators compute the minimum and maximum string values respectively in a column during query execution.\r\n\r\nThroughout the implementation process, I had some difficulty understand some of the below, and would appreciate extra care in the reviewing process for:\r\n- Usage of `expression` in the aggregator factories.\r\n- Use cases of `SingleValueDimensionVectorSelector` and `MultiValueDimensionVectorSelector` for vector aggregation.\r\n- VectorAggregator classes in general.\r\n- Should I mention my aggregators under `moving-average-query.md`?\r\n\r\nRegarding the issue #11659 that is linked to #16956, I did some testing, and while my string aggregators can run on datasources: \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT min(\"user\")\r\nFROM \"wikipedia\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n```\r\n*feridiák\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the following will still not work.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  min(\"start\"), max(\"end\")\r\nFROM sys.segments\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n```\r\nError: RUNTIME_FAILURE (OPERATOR)\r\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, let's go into the description of my implementations.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Add StringMin and StringMax Aggregators\r\n- Implemented `StringMinAggregator` to find the minimum string value in a column.\r\n- Implemented `StringMaxAggregator` to find the maximum string value in a column.\r\n- Implemented `StringMinBufferAggregator` and `StringMaxBufferAggregator` for efficient in-memory aggregation.\r\n- Implemented `StringMinVectorAggregator` and `StringMaxVectorAggregator` for vectorized query execution.\r\n\r\n#### Setting up Aggregator Factory classes\r\n- Implemented `StringMinAggregatorFactory` and `StringMaxAggregatorFactory` to create the respective aggregators.\r\n- Allow creation of `StringMinAggregatorFactory` and `StringMaxAggregatorFactory` under `createMinAggregatorFactory` and `createMaxAggregatorFactory` respectively.\r\n- Change logic of `Aggregations#getArgumentsForSimpleAggregator` to accommodate the new String aggregation functions.\r\n- Add new cache key IDs under `AggregatorUtils`\r\n- Add the new aggregators as modules to `AggregatorsModule`.\r\n\r\n#### Unit Tests\r\n- Added unit tests for all above classes, except VectorAggregators. \r\n- Added the new aggregator factory classes in `AggregatorFactoryTest`.\r\n- Remove `AGGREGATION_NOT_SUPPORT_TYPE` annotations under `DrillWindowQueryTest` to support testing of new aggregators.\r\n- Add new tests under `DrillWindowQueryTest`\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNew: You can now query string columns with min() and max() functions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n- `StringMinAggregator`\r\n- `StringMaxAggregator`\r\n- `StringMinBufferAggregator`\r\n- `StringMaxBufferAggregator`\r\n- `StringMinVectorAggregator`\r\n- `StringMaxVectorAggregator`\r\n- `StringMinAggregatorFactory`\r\n- `StringMaxAggregatorFactory`\r\n- `StringMinAggregatorTest`\r\n- `StringMaxAggregatorTest` \r\n- `StringMinBufferAggregatorTest`\r\n- `StringMaxBufferAggregatorTest`\r\n- `StringMinVectorAggregatorTest`\r\n- `StringMaxVectorAggregatorTest`\r\n- `StringMinAggregatorFactoryTest`\r\n- `StringMaxAggregatorFactoryTest`\r\n- `aggregations.md`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR is a refactoring of some of the classes around TaskAdapter in the kubernetes-overlord-extensions. There shouldn't really be any logic changes.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Instead of constructing the TaskAdapter instance in KubernetesTaskRunnerFactory, include a TaskAdapter provider in KubernetesOverlordModule that gets injected into KubernetesTaskRunnerFactory. This makes the adapter logic easier to test since we can just look at the injected object in KubernetesOverlordModule tests rather than trying to look at the KubernetesTaskRunner object that KubernetesTaskRunnerFactory creates.\r\n- Move the pod template logic in PodTemplateAdapter into a new PodTemplateSelector class that exposes getPodTemplateForTask(task). This makes it easier to test because we can test pod template selection logic independently from the logic in PodTemplateAdapter (e.g. the logic to add specific env variables to the generated pod template can be tested independently of the pod templates themselves since we can just pass in a TestPodTemplateSelector).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n-Refactor classes in kubernetes-overlord-extensions\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesOverlordModule`\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunnerFactory`\r\n * `PodTemplateTaskAdapter`\r\n * `PodTemplateSelector`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the \"intervals\" feature on subqueries, or any non-table, should be avoided because it isn't a meaningful optimization in those cases, and it's simpler for runtime implementations if they can assume all filters are located in the regular filter object.\r\n\r\nTwo changes:\r\n\r\n1) Fix the logic in DruidQuery.canUseIntervalFiltering. It was intended\r\n   to return false for QueryDataSource, but actually returned true.\r\n\r\n2) Add a validation to ScanQueryFrameProcessor to ensure that when running\r\n   on an input channel (which would include any subquery), the query has\r\n   \"intervals\" set to ONLY_ETERNITY.\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, the new test case in testTimeFilterOnSubquery would throw a \"Can only handle a

change https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15757 to merge FireHydrants flatly for realtime queries for optimising memory usage led to metrics like `query/segment/time` getting emitted per-FireHydrant instead of per-Sink. \r\n\r\nThis change restores the metric emission behaviour while keeping the optimisation intact. \r\n\r\nIt introduces a new `SinkMetricsEmittingQueryRunner` which accumulates the FireHydrants metrics per-Sink and emits them in the end. \r\nThe emitted metrics are `query/segment/time`, `query/segmentAndCacheTime` & `query/wait/time`. \r\n`query/wait/time` is the time taken to start processing the first FireHydrant for the sink. \r\n\r\n#### Testing  \r\n- Added UT to verify that each of the above metrics are emitted once per Sink. \r\n- Locally verified the changes for realtime ingestion.

an issue after #17098 that can occur with `array_to_mv` function resulting from a couple of things happening. The first problem is that `VectorValueMatcherColumnProcessorFactory` method `makeObjectProcessor` had special handling for `STRING`, but not further specialization for when it was multi-valued. So, this PR adds `MultiValueStringObjectVectorValueMatcher` to handle cases where an object selector is asked for a multi-value string. Secondly, expression virtual columns were not expecting multi-value string expressions, so `ExpressionVectorSelectors` has been updated to check for array typed outputs but with a string type hint, and use a newly added `ExpressionVectorMultiValueStringObjectSelector` which coerces the values multi-value style back into `List` or `String` as appropriate.\r\n\r\nAdded tests also led to another bug being fixed when array_to_mv was used on a null array row.","created_at":"2024-09-26T00:38:46Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T05:57:34Z","closed_at":"2024-09-26T05:57:29Z","merged_at":"2024-09-26T05:57:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b5b61ef7f4f7ae20a79f7194078f59635c40fb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `WindowOperatorQueryKit` to use a new class `WindowStage` to represent the different window stages. Previously we were dealing with `List<OperatorFactory>` or `List<List<OperatorFactory>>`, and doing a bunch of `instanceof` checks, so this refactor makes it much more readable and cleaner.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not have any functional change.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the logic for usage of segment descriptors from queries in SinkQuerySegmentWalker when there are upgraded segments as a result of concurrent replace.\r\n\r\n### Concurrent append and replace:\r\nWith the introduction of concurrent append and replace, for a given interval:\r\n1. The same sink can correspond to a base segment V0_x0, and have multiple mappings to higher versions with distinct partition numbers such as V1_x1.... Vn_xn.\r\n2. The initial segment allocation can happen on version V0, but there can be several allocations during the lifecycle of a task which can have different versions spanning from V0 to Vn.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n1. Maintain a new timeline of <SegmentDescriptorOvershadowable> (An overshadowable holding a SegmentDescriptor)\r\n2. Every segment allocation of version upgrade adds the latest segment descriptor to this timeline.\r\n3. Iterate this timeline instead of the sinkTimeline to get the segment descriptors in getQueryRunnerForIntervals\r\n4. Also maintain a mapping of the upgraded segment to its base segment.\r\n5. When a sink is needed to process the query, find the base segment corresponding to a given descriptor, and then use the sinkTimeline to find its chunk.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\nFor a given interval [2024/2025], the following sequence of events has happened\r\n\r\n1. We begin at V0 and allocate segment with partition number 0, let's call it V0_0\r\n2. A replace happens and segment V0_0 is upgraded to V1_3\r\n3. A new segment is further allocated and V1_4 is its id. (Since V1 is the latest version)\r\n4. A subsequent replace happens at version V2 and upgrades: V0_0 -> V2_5, V1_3 -> V2_7 happen\r\n5. Let's say there's a third allocation with id V2_9\r\n\r\nThe state of the sinkTimeline is {\r\n  V0: [V0_0], \r\n  V1: [V1_3], \r\n  V2: [V2_9]\r\n}\r\nThe state of the updatedTimeline is {\r\n  V0: [V0_0].\r\n  V1: [V1_2(V0_0), V1_3], \r\n  V2: [V2_5(V0_0), V2_7(V1_3), V2_9]\r\n}\r\nThe mapping of upgraded segments to base versions is: {\r\n  V1_2 -> V0_0, \r\n  V2_5 -> V0_0, \r\n  V2_7 -> V1_3\r\n}\r\n\r\nAt this point, let us say we get a query for the interval [2024-02/2024-08]. \r\n```\r\nStep 0: \r\nThe broker would resolve the version as V2 as it is the latest announced and complete interval.\r\n\r\nStep 1:. \r\nThe sink query segment walker would find all descriptors corresponding to V2 and the interval:  [ \r\n  {version:V2, num:5, itvl:[2024-02/2024-08]}, \r\n  {version:V2, num:7, itvl:[2024-02/2024-08]}, \r\n  {version:V2, num:9, itvl:[2024-02/2024-08]}\r\n]\r\nHad we used the sinkTimeline, we would have only gotten the last descriptor.\r\n\r\nStep 2:\r\n  For descriptor[0]: {version:v2, num:5, itvl[2024-02/2024-08]}\r\n         - determine the actual upgraded segment -> V2_5\r\n         - find the base segment and sink: `V0_0.sink`\r\n  For descriptor[1]:{version:v2, num:7, itvl[2024-02/2024-08]}\r\n         - determine the actual upgraded segment -> V2_7\r\n         - find the base segment and sink: `V1_3.sink`\r\n  For descriptor[2]: {version:v2, num:9, itvl[2024-02/2024-08]}\r\n         - determine the actual upgraded segment -> V2_9\r\n         - find the base segment and sink: `V2_9.sink`\r\n\r\nStep3:\r\nAs before ....\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the following bugs:\r\n\r\n1. Queries failing with missing segment descriptors.\r\nThis can happen when query segment descriptors are narrower than the actual segment's descriptor. In such a case, the map would fail to return base segment (needed to obtain the sink).\r\n\r\n2. Clean up and unannouncement of upgraded segments\r\nThe task state without concurrent append and replace is unaffected.\r\nWhen concurrent append and replace happens, segment mappings may remain in memory and unannouncement may not happen until the task exits, but this doesn't affect query correctness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nTest on a cluster\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17137.\r\n\r\nInstead of moving the streaming-only methods to the `SeekableStreamSupervisor` abstract class, this patch moves them to a separate `StreamSupervisor` interface. The reason is that the `SeekableStreamSupervisor` abstract class also has many other abstract methods. The `StreamSupervisor` interface on the other hand provides a minimal set of functions offering a good middle ground for any custom concrete implementation that doesn't require all the goodies from `SeekableStreamSupervisor`.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Move the methods that was moved in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17137 to a separate `StreamSupervisor` interface\r\n- Update the `instanceof` checks in `SupervisorManager` to reflect the more generic interface

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PlannerContext`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

an issue noticed after #17098, where the `CastToStringVectorProcessor` wasn't actually doing a cast, and instead just using `Evals.asString`. This was fine when only numbers and strings were supported in vectorized expressions, but insufficient when arrays and complex types are allowed.\r\n\r\nThe solution is just to remove `CastToStringVectorProcessor` in favor of always using `CastToObjectVectorProcessor`. Alternatively, we could have left `CastToObjectVectorProcessor` to use in cases where we were casting from a numeric type, but that seems a bit confusing so I just removed

This causes the main task to get stuck in `PUBLISHING` state forever, until we kill it or pendingCompletionTimeout interrupts the thread.\r\n\r\nThe underlying cause of this issue is that this intermediateTempExecutor is implemented using newBlockingSingleThreaded, which created a thread pool executor with maxCoreSize: 1 and a [SynchronousQueue](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/SynchronousQueue.html). \r\nThe `rejectedExecutionHandler` of this ThreadExecutor should not add tasks when it's in shutDown state because, a SynchronousQueue is used and if a task is `put()` in it in ShutDown state, it will forever stuck in WAITING state as executor will not `take()` the task to schedule it. In a `SynchronousQueue` there should always be a `take()` WAITING for every `put()` operation and vice-versa. \r\n\r\nIn the [issue](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/16783), I have added thread dumps too that confirm tasks being stuck during `rejectedExecution()` when task is added in queue during a shutDown state. The Unit test confirms the thread getting stuck. \r\nIn `StreamAppenderator`, it happens when  there is a race condition [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/seekablestream/SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner.java#L879-L883)\r\n```\r\n        Futures.allAsList(publishWaitList).cancel(true);\r\n        Futures.allAsList(handOffWaitList).cancel(true);\r\n        if (appenderator != null) {\r\n          appenderator.closeNow();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWe don't wait for appenderator.drop() to be interrupted in handOffWaitList and appenderator.closeNow() shuts down the exeuctors. Thus a new task is sometimes added in intermediateTempExecutor through appenderator.drop() while executor is already shutDown.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nIn `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor`, currently we were not adding the partition boost column to the `ColumnSelectorFactory` used to create the `FrameWriter`. Because of this, the boost column was not being written to the frame.\r\n\r\nThis was causing the quantile sketch to misjudge the number of output partitions to create, as it was creating a single partition boundary because we had the same value for boost column (null byte) across all rows.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following query with `maxNumTasks=5`:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"test_1\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT\r\n  \"__time\",\r\n  \"countryName\",\r\n  \"cityName\",\r\n  count(cityName) over (partition by countryName) as countCity,\r\n  ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by countryName) as rowNumberCity\r\nFROM \"wikipedia\"\r\ngroup by __time, countryName, cityName\r\nPARTITIONED BY HOUR\r\nCLUSTERED BY countryName\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, we were getting 1 worker in the Scan stage after the Window stage:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1213\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2b079b-d9f5-4bb0-bfaf-41231d933094\">\r\n\r\nWith this PR's change, we get multiple workers in the Scan stage after the Window stage:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1274\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f610e1-c8db-4cf8-b2a5-91af214befa2\">\r\n\r\n### Test changes of the PR\r\n\r\n- I had to update some MSQ drill tests to use single worker as they were giving a different correct result. I could add some `order by` to try and make the output deterministically correct for queries of these tests, but since these were tests from the drill suite, I thought it's best to leave them untouched and just use a single worker for these.\r\n- The changes in `testWindowOnMixOfEmptyAndNonEmptyOverWithMultipleWorkers` reflects the above situation where previously we were getting 1 worker in the stage after the Window stage, but now we're getting 4 workers (as we use `maxNumTasks=5` in this particular test).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

patch adds a profile of MSQ named \"Dart\" that runs on Brokers and Historicals, and which is compatible with the standard SQL query API. For more high-level description, and notes on future work, refer to #17139.\r\n\r\nThis patch contains the following changes, grouped into packages.\r\n\r\n**Controller (org.apache.druid.msq.dart.controller):**\r\n\r\nThe controller runs on Brokers. Main classes are,\r\n\r\n- DartSqlResource, which serves /druid/v2/sql/dart/.\r\n- DartSqlEngine and DartQueryMaker, the entry points from SQL that actually run the MSQ controller code.\r\n- DartControllerContext, which configures the MSQ controller.\r\n- DartMessageRelays, which sets up relays (see \"message relays\" below) to read messages from workers' DartControllerClients.\r\n- DartTableInputSpecSlicer, which assigns work based on a TimelineServerView.\r\n\r\n**Worker (org.apache.druid.msq.dart.worker)**\r\n\r\nThe worker runs on Historicals. Main classes are,\r\n\r\n- DartWorkerResource, which supplies the regular MSQ WorkerResource, plus Dart-specific APIs.\r\n- DartWorkerRunner, which runs MSQ worker code.\r\n- DartWorkerContext, which configures the MSQ worker.\r\n- DartProcessingBuffersProvider, which provides processing buffers from sliced-up merge buffers.\r\n- DartDataSegmentProvider, which provides segments from the Historical's local cache.\r\n\r\n**Message relays (org.apache.druid.messages):**\r\n\r\nTo avoid the need for Historicals to contact Brokers during a query, which would create opportunities for queries to get stuck, all connections are opened from Broker to Historical. This is made possible by a message relay system, where the relay server (worker) has an outbox of messages.\r\n\r\nThe relay client (controller) connects to the outbox and retrieves messages. Code for this system lives in the \"server\" package to keep it separate from the MSQ extension and make it easier to maintain. The worker-to-controller ControllerClient is implemented using message relays.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n\r\n- Controller: Added the method \"hasWorker\". Used by the ControllerMessageListener to notify the appropriate controllers when a worker fails.\r\n- WorkerResource: No longer tries to respond more than once in the \"httpGetChannelData\" API. This comes up when a response due to resolved future is ready at about the same time as a timeout occurs.\r\n- MSQTaskQueryMaker: Refactor to separate out some useful functions for reuse in DartQueryMaker.\r\n- SqlEngine: Add \"queryContext\" to \"resultTypeForSelect\" and \"resultTypeForInsert\". This allows the DartSqlEngine to modify result format based on whether a \"fullReport\" context parameter is set.\r\n- LimitedOutputStream: New utility class. Used when in \"fullReport\" mode.\r\n- TimelineServerView: Add getDruidServerMetadata as a performance optimization.\r\n- CliHistorical: Add SegmentWrangler, so it can query inline data, lookups, etc.\r\n- ServiceLocation: Add \"fromUri\" method, relocating some code from ServiceClientImpl.\r\n- FixedServiceLocator: New locator for a fixed set of service locations. Useful for URI locations.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-24T09:14:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T21:38:58Z","closed_at":"2024-10-01T21:38:55Z","merged_at":"2024-10-01T21:38:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"878adff9aaa8d28ddbba0119c44dae4809dd5744","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area
