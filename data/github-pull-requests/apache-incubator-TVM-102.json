_type_child_slots can be used to enable quick type checking optimization\r\nby checking the whether the type index is within the bound.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables these static slots:\r\n\r\n- Introduce a static assert to avoid the scenario when a developer forget to\r\n  _type_child_slots when the field is set for the type's parent.\r\n- Revamp and assign static type index to common runtime objects\r\n- Add a DumpTypeTable call to allow developer monitor the current situation\r\n  of type table and offers suggestions for the slots(ideally the slots equals\r\n  the number of children so there is no overflow.\r\n\r\nI only converted the most common base nodes(Expr/Stmt/Type) because we run frequent runtime type checks on these nodes. The other nodes are left as it is to test the overflow fallback mechanism.

However issues still remain. \r\n\r\nThe 3 tflite failures that I see in the run: \r\n\r\n _test_forward_elemwise(partial(_test_add, fused_activation_function=\"RELU6\"))\r\n_test_forward_unary_elemwise(_test_tan)\r\ntest_forward_qnn_mobilenet_v3_net\r\n\r\nThere are 3 open issues with running Tensorflow tests with 2.1.0 which need investigation. \r\n\r\nFAILED tests/python/frontend/tensorflow/test_forward.py::test_tensor_array_size\r\nFAILED tests/python/frontend/tensorflow/test_forward.py::test_tensor_array_stack\r\nFAILED tests/python/frontend/tensorflow/test_forward.py::test_tensor_array_unstack\r\n\r\nNext steps here : \r\n- I would suggest merging this given additional support being added for operators > 1.13.x and migrate up our CI images to using TF2.1.0 \r\n- File issues for each of the issues with help wanted tag. I'll try and tackle them in due course.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @FrozenGene  @kevinthesun , please help review and

the extent of `threadIdx.x` equals to the warp size, only `threadIdx.x` should be a index of a warp memory, while `threadIdx.y` or `threadIdx.z` should not, since warp shuffle is inside a warp, rather than outside.\r\n\r\nThe old code make every indices to be indices of a warp memory, which lead to a bug in my application. Unfortunately, I failed to construct a simple enough counter-example for this. Things are complicated by numerous transformation passes. Actually the bug in my application is only a bound checking problem, and the memory accessing indices is somehow correct. Anyway, this PR indeed fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nIn fact, things are more complicated because `threadIdx` can be less than the warp size. To determine whether an index is inside or outside a warp, we need to know the extent of that index. But this information is not available in `MakeLoopNest`. I assume only `threadIdx.x` is inside a warp for now, but left a warning message in case we detect `threadIdx.y` or `threadIdx.z`.\r\n\r\nRequesting a review from @tqchen, or @yongfeng-nv (from a

pass and helpful function to lower dense model to block sparse model.\r\n\r\nIn this PR it brings two new optimization involves change of weight, under name scope of ```relay.data_dep_optimization```:\r\n\r\n1. ```simplify_fc_transpose```\r\nThis optimization is able to automatically convert ```y = nn.dense(x, transpose(w, [1, 0])``` to ```y = nn.dense(x, wt)```, and pre-transpose relevant parameters before future optimization.\r\n\r\n2. ```bsr_dense```\r\nThis optimization is able to automatically convert ```y = nn.dense(x, w)``` to block sparse operation ```nn.sparse_dense``` when ```w``` qualified sparsifty requirement (manual set so far)\r\n\r\nBoth optimizations should be run before normal lowing steps.\r\n\r\nI did some init experiments on BERT (uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12) with perfect random block sparse weights. Not all operators are tuned but it is enough to see the gain of block sparse.\r\n\r\nDense: 213 ms\r\n\r\n| Sparsity / Blocksize | (32, 1) | (16, 1) | (8, 1) |\r\n|----------------------|---------|---------|--------|\r\n| 0.95                 | 107 ms  | 58 ms   | 61 ms  |\r\n| 0.9                  | 167 ms  | 62 ms   | 67 ms  |\r\n| 0.85                 |         | 66 ms   | 74 ms  |\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work can be easily extended to 1x1 convolution.

is an useful object for tensor expression.\r\nHowever, making it part of the TIR makes the abstraction less clean.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first step to remove this dependency. In particular,\r\nwe will use Buffer in all the places where the te::Tensor is being used.\r\nWe can not use IRModule of PrimFunc to represent TIR at any point of the\r\noptimizations.\r\n\r\n- The TIR passes will no longer need to consider Provide/HalideCall and Realize\r\n- Instead, we will use the BufferLoad/Store and BufferRealize.\r\n\r\nBuffer will serve as the only abstraction for the TIR data models to represent the intermediate storage among computations. We still keep Realize/HalideCall and Provide as TIR nodes for now to make the change minimum. Right after ScheduleOps, we call SchedulePostProcToPrimFunc to canonicalize the temporary IR generated by TE(which contains these nodes) to the TIR.\r\n\r\nThe TIR optimizations are now mostly migrated to to the pass manager. With only a few to be migrated as subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\n## New TIR Pass Infra Key Points\r\n\r\n- TIR and te are de-coupled(except for the initial few cases before SchedulePostProcToPrimFunc\r\n- IRModule(of PrimFunc) becomes the recommended and only of storing intermediate results between passes (unifies with the relay convention). \r\n- BufferLoad/Store are used to support mult-dimensional load/store\r\n- PrimFunc is the main object of interest to represent all TIR related functions\r\n- Use the same Pass, PassContext and infrastructure as relay\r\n   - Still need a few more refactors to migrate BuildConfig->PassContext\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

this PR, I update object detection ops: `get_valid_count` and `nms` by removing data arrangement on the GPU. For `get_valid_count`, there are two computations: counting the number of valid elements; rearanging the valid elements to the front of the array and marking those invalid elements as -1. By removing the data rearrangement computation, and moving it to nms's argsort, we get a speedup of 266x for `get_valid_count` op in `ssd_resnet50_v1` model. I also remove data rearrangement for `nms` on the GPU. Though getting extra work for `argsort` in `nms`, we get another 7x speedup by removing the unessarry data rearrangment on the GPU. Note that with `get_valid_count` changed, the old topi/relay tests won't work. But the end-to-end object detection accuracy doesn't drop. Here's a performance comparison table for these two ops in `ssd_resnet50_v1` with input size (1, 3, 512, 512) with Thrust turned on in build.\r\n | Operator | Time (ms) w/o this PR | Time (ms) w/ this

I made this PR to add operation `dilate` into relay.\r\n\r\nMy main goal is to be able to implement a complete version of `conv2d_transpose` in relay which supports all values for groups, dilations, output padding and strides (code based on Theano mplementation: https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/nnet/abstract_conv.py#L2927 ). I needed operation `dilation` to do that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\n\r\n\r\ndef conv2d_transpose(\r\n    input_shape, kern_shape, strides, padding, dilation, output_padding,
