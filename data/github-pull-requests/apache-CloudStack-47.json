Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis PR addresses an old security issue regarding jQuery-UI. We are updating jQuery-UI to version 1.11, instead of 1.12, because the 1.12 version requires an update of jQuery.js as well. Therefore, to reduce the surface of changes, we are first only updating the jQuery-UI library.\r\n\r\nMoreover, unnecessary CSS and image files from the jQuery-UI library were deleted.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen users create a VPC, and configure a NAT from a public IP to application in a VM. This VM(applications) are not accessible via public IP for other VMs in the same VPC\r\n\r\nThe problem is in the NAT table. If you take a closer look at rules, you will see something like:\r\n`-A PREROUTING -d publicIP/32 -i eth1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination internalIp:80`\r\n\r\nThe problem is that according to this rule only packets coming via eth1(public interface), will be “redirected” to the internal IP. We need an extra entry to each one of the NAT configurations. For the presented rule, we would need something like:\r\n`-A PREROUTING -d publicIP/32 -i eth2 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination internalIp:80`\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nEvery time there is a major CloudStack version that requires a new systemvmtemplate, admins need to restart VRs which can take few (sometimes several) minutes. The aim is to make it easier to perform a rolling restart (or blue-green deployment) of the network with acceptable downtime. In this strategy, a new VR is provisioned before the old VR is destroyed/cleaned for non-redundant isolated VRs. For redundant networks, a rolling replacement of routers is performed.\r\n\r\nThe network downtime is usually the short-time (less than 10s) after the new VR starts (nics are up) and old VR is destroyed. The downtime may be affected by several factors as the new VR has a different mac address, stale ARP cache may take upto 30seconds (default `gc_timeout` on Linux) to renew in guests making egress traffic downtime slightly higher than ingress traffic (ingress, i.e. public network requesting access to VR's public ip). As an illustration, ingress traffic such as a http request or ssh request to the VR's public IP that port-forwards to guest VM may face lower downtime than egress traffic (say a ping or curl from guest VM to public Internet). Among several environment factors, the following interval/timeouts affect how the old VR's ip-mac address is cached:\r\n\r\n    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_interval\r\n    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_stale_time\r\n    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_interval\r\n    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_timeout\r\n\r\nTo make things faster, a gratituous ARP notification is sent by the new VR (again) after the old VR is successfully destroyed.\r\n\r\nProject Goals:\r\n- [x] Reduce systemvmtemplate size, see #2506. Smaller the image size, faster it will be to copy template to primary storage to provision new VR.\r\n- [x] Rolling reboot/deployment of VRs for isolated network with non-rVRs\r\n- [x] Rolling reboot/deployment of VRs for isolated network with rVRs\r\n- [x] Rolling reboot/deployment of VRs for VPCs with non-rVRs and rVRs\r\n\r\nFuture:\r\n- Speed up iptables rules application \r\n- Move away from iptables, move to nftables\r\n- Move away from Python2 codebase to Python3 or something else like Go? TBD\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nThis extends securing of KVM hosts to securing of libvirt on KVM\r\nhost as well for TLS enabled live VM migration. To simplify implementation\r\nsecuring of host implies that both host and libvirtd processes are\r\nsecured with management server's CA plugin issued certificates.\r\n\r\nFS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Secure+Live+VM+Migration+for+KVM\r\n\r\nBased on whether keystore and certificates files are available at\r\n/etc/cloudstack/agent, the KVM agent determines whether to use TLS or\r\nTCP based uris for live VM migration. It is also enforced that a secured\r\nhost will allow live VM migration to/from other secured host, and an\r\nunsecured hosts will allow live VM migration to/from other unsecured\r\nhost only.\r\n\r\nPost upgrade the KVM agent on startup will expose its security state\r\n(secured detail is sent as true or false) to the managements server that\r\ngets saved in host_details for the host. This host detail can be accesed\r\nvia the listHosts response, and in the UI unsecured KVM hosts will show\r\nup with the host state of ‘unsecured’. Further, a button has been added\r\nthat allows admins to provision/renew certificates to KVM hosts and can\r\nbe used to secure any unsecured KVM host.\r\n\r\nThe `cloudstack-setup-agent` was modified to accept a new flag `-s`\r\nwhich will reconfigure libvirtd with following settings:\r\n\r\n    listen_tcp=0\r\n    listen_tls=1\r\n    tcp_port=\"16509\"\r\n    tls_port=\"16514\"\r\n    auth_tcp=\"none\"\r\n    auth_tls=\"none\"\r\n    key_file = \"/etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem\"\r\n    cert_file = \"/etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem\"\r\n    ca_file = \"/etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem\"\r\n\r\nFor a connected KVM host agent, when the certificate are\r\nrenewed/provisioned a background task is scheduled that waits until all\r\nof the agent tasks finish after which libvirt process is restarted and\r\nfinally the agent is restarted via AgentShell.\r\n\r\nThere are no API or DB changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

up in a new cluster (not if it is just started up on a new host in the same cluster).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nExample: A VM that uses managed storage is stopped. The VM is then started on a different host in the same cluster. The Start operation fails.\r\n\r\nTo get around this issue, you must either start the VM up on the same host or on a host in a different cluster.\r\n\r\nThe reason is due to a slightly erroneous check in VolumeOrchestrator.prepare.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, we should be checking if the cluster ID changes, not if the host ID changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI noticed that I could not start a stopped VM that uses managed storage on a different host in the same cluster as the host it was originally running on.\r\n\r\nAfter I changed the code (this PR), I re-tested the scenario. I can now start the VM up on a different host in the same cluster as the host it was originally running on. Also, I can still start it up on the same host as it was originally running on or on a host in a different cluster.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I have read the

Description\r\nFor managed storage, each time a virtual disk is created, a new SR is created (when on XenServer) or a new datastore is created (when on VMware).\r\n\r\nXenServer 6.5 can support around 500 - 600 SRs per compute cluster before the creation of the next SR starts taking a fairly long time (over a minute). This is, for some admins, unacceptable and they would like a way to stop CloudStack from creating SRs once a certain admin-specified limit is reached. To be clear, though, once the SR is created, it does not suffer performance issues.\r\n\r\nVMware can support 256 datastores per compute cluster. This is a hard limit.\r\n\r\nCloudStack has never had the ability to limit the number of SRs or datastores it creates when using managed storage (the admin has needed to pay attention to this via some other process outside of CloudStack).\r\n\r\nThis code aims to address the main use cases in CloudStack that can create SRs or datastores and fails the applicable operations if no more SRs or datastores can be created (based on a new cluster-scoped setting that specifies how many SRs or datastores the admin is OK with CloudStack creating).\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10336\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack SSO (using `security.singlesignon.key`) does not work anymore with CloudStack 4.11, since commit 9988c26, which introduced a regression due to a refactoring: every API request that is not \"validated\" generates the same error (401 - Unauthorized) and invalidates the session.\r\n\r\nHowever, CloudStack UI executes a call to `listConfigurations` [in method `bypassLoginCheck`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/1c99fd73881938/ui/scripts/cloudStack.js#L172). A non-admin user does not have the permissions to execute this request, which causes an error 401:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"listconfigurationsresponse\":{\"uuidList\":[],\"errorcode\":401,\"errortext\":\"unable to verify user credentials and/or request signature\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe session (already created by SSO) is then invalidated and the user cannot access to CloudStack UI (error \"Session Expired\").\r\n\r\nBefore 9988c26 (up to CloudStack 4.10), an error 432 was returned (and ignored):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"errorresponse\":{\"uuidList\":[],\"errorcode\":432,\"cserrorcode\":9999,\"errortext\":\"The user is not allowed to request the API command or the API command does not exist\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if the call to `listConfigurations` was removed, another call to [`listIdps`](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/1c99fd73881938/ui/scripts/cloudStack.js#L192) also lead to an error 401 for user accounts if the SAML plugin is not enabled.\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to fix the SSO issue, by restoring errors 432 (instead of 401 + invalidate session) for commands not available. However, if an API command is explicitly denied using ACLs or if the session key is incorrect, it still generates an error 401 and invalidates the session.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nUsers should be able to edit an ACL rule completely. Therefore, they must be able to change the protocol type and others configs of an ACL rules.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is not just the protocol that users are not able to change. For instance, after defining ports, or reason/description for the rule, users are not able to set those values back to null. The same happens for ICMP code and type.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce a new parameter called \"partialUpdate\", which will have its default value as true to maintain backward compatibility. When this parameter is set to false, we will consider only the parameters sent, and not the parameters we already have in the database to change and validate the ACL rule data. This allows us to update parameters already set back to null, and to completely change an ACL rule.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10332\r\n\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n* Create an ACL for ICMP\r\n* Click on edit and change the protocol to TCP\r\n* An error will happen when saving the rule.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10326\r\n\r\nThis issue was discovered, fixed and tested on KVM, but applies for every hypervisor.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nWhen enabling

is a continuation of work developed on PR #2425 (CLOUDSTACK-10240), which provided root admins an override mechanism to move volumes between storage systems types (local/shared) even when the disk offering would not allow such operation. To complete the work, we will now provide a way for administrators to enter a new disk offering that can reflect the new placement of the volume. We will add an extra parameter to allow the root admin inform a new disk offering for the volume. Therefore, when the volume is being migrated, it will be possible to replace the disk offering to reflect the new placement of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe API method will have the following parameters:\r\n\r\n* storageid (required)\r\n* volumeid (required)\r\n* livemigrate(optional)\r\n* newdiskofferingid (optional) – this is the new parameter\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is the following:\r\n\r\n* If “newdiskofferingid” is not provided the current behavior is maintained. Override mechanism will also keep working as we have seen so far.\r\n* If the “newdiskofferingid” is provided by the admin, we will execute the following checks\r\n    * new disk offering mode (local/shared) must match the target storage mode. If it does not match, an exception will be thrown and the operator will receive a message indicating the problem.\r\n    * we will check if the new disk offering tags match the target storage tags. If it does not match, an exception will be thrown and the operator will receive a message indicating the problem.\r\n    * check if the target storage has the capacity for the new volume. If it does not have enough space, then an exception is thrown and the operator will receive a message indicating the problem.\r\n    * check if the size of the volume is the same as the size of the new disk offering. If it is not the same, we will ALLOW the change of the service offering, and a warning message will be logged.\r\n\r\nWe execute the change of the Disk offering as soon as the migration of the volume finishes.

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10321\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nLibvirt has the concept of a 'period' and a 'quota'. If the period is 10000 microseconds, a quote can be set, say 5000 and the VM CPU will be limited to only using 5000 microseconds of CPU every 10000 microseconds. \r\nThis patch basically looks at the host CPU MHz (say 2000 MHz), looks at the VM's configured MHz (say 500 MHz), comes up with a percent (25%), then uses that against the period to come up with a quota number (2500). Additionally, it only applies appropriately when the service offering has the CPU cap option set/checkmarked.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThese changes are restricted to the KVM hypervisor plugin, where creation of a VM (spec) will consider CPU cap (max speed) defined in the service offering to define and set quota/limits in the VM’s spec.

some circumstances, the API is returning an invalid response, for simplicity I will expose the JSON case. The API response on a `listVirtualMachines` can be this string:\r\n```\r\n{ \"listvirtualmachinesresponse\" :  ] } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo understand how this is possible, assume you have more than one management server and one is processing the destroy of a virtual machine in the account X which is the only one it has. Another process is returning the result of `listVirtualMachines` for that same account X. During the listVM command, the result set is fetch with a `searchAndDistinctCount` due to the view (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/api/query/QueryManagerImpl.java#L1024). This is done through 2 queries in the GenericDao https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/framework/db/src/main/java/com/cloud/utils/db/GenericDaoBase.java#L1323 and if you encounter the right conditions, the VM will be marked as removed in between those 2 queries. This results in having a Pair result with at least one object but a count of 0. Then following how is done the serialization of the response at https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/api/response/ApiResponseSerializer.java#L86 you will reach the case where your output is the one previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this issue, there isn't a true fix but only a better pair response to ensure a correct response formatting.

HA logic just does not work.  VM's with HA enabled would never restart after a host failure.  Had to re-do most of that logic.  There are comments inline with the code, but down below is the general updated logic.  Sorry for the long notes... \r\n\r\nPS. We enabled virtlockd (https://libvirt.org/locking-lockd.html) and highly recommend it, otherwise you can have VM HA start a VM on multiple hosts.\r\n\r\nWe are running KVM FYI.\r\n\r\n- If host-agent is unreachable, handleDisconnectWithInvestigation() is called as always.\r\n- The investigators are called to see what happened, which is one of the following two scenarios.  (If it isn't one of the two below, then the host just came back UP, or another status was returned and that is also logged.  But the two scenarios below are what needed updated the most)\r\n\r\n**If the investigators find the host is UP, but just the agent is unreachable**\r\nThe host is put into DISCONNECTED status.  It will stay in this status and the PingTimeouts will continue to call handleDisconnectWithoutInvestigation() periodically.  It will stay in DISCONNECTED status until the AlertWait config option expires.  If the AlertWait time eventually is hit, and the investigators are still just reporting that the host is DISCONNECTED and not DOWN.  Then we'll put the host into ALERT state and we'll stay there until the investigators say the host is UP or the investigators say the host is DOWN.  If the host goes DOWN, then VM HA will be initiated.\r\n\r\n**If the investigators find the host is DOWN**\r\nThen VM HA is initiated...\r\n\r\n**VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl.java**\r\nThe file VirtualNetworkApplianceManagerImpl.java is edited for a related VM HA problem.  When a Host is determined to be DOWN, CloudStack attempts to VM HA any affected routers.  The problem is, when the host is determined to be down, by code referenced above, the host may not actually be DOWN.  On KVM for example, the host is considered DOWN if the agent is stopped on the KVM host for too long.  In that case, the VMs could still be running just fine...  However when we think the host is DOWN, VM HA runs on the router and as part of that it unallocates/cleans-up the router and it's 169.x.x.x control IP is unallocated.  Then after it cleans it up, it tries to power on the router on another host, and as part of that it allocates a NEW 169.x.x.x control IP and writes that to the DB.  However, since the router isn't actually down (we just think the host is down) the VM HA fails as the vRouter is currently still running on the problem host.  \r\n\r\nNext, in this example, when the host agent is back online again, it sends a power report to the mgmt servers, and the management servers think the router was powered-on OOB.  However, the GUI will not show a control IP for the vRouter, and the DB will have the NEW control IP it tried to allocated during the failed VM HA event.  Thus, leaving us unable to communicate with the vRouter.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a simple check that we can still communicate with the vRouter after any OOB power-on occurs.  If we can, then we have the correct control IP in the DB and we're good - so we do nothing.  If we can't communicate with the vRouter after the OOB power-on, we do a reboot of the vRouter to fix it.","created_at":"2018-03-01T21:53:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T20:12:47Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T20:12:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4bbc0af152cda886e4b2ffe85aba2cdf49977b27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/2474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bc0ca17cf8339ae8d2b2c0ed2d33eb0299a9d7ae","head":{"label":"Slair1:CLOUDSTACK-10246-VM-HA","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-10246-VM-HA","sha":"bc0ca17cf8339ae8d2b2c0ed2d33eb0299a9d7ae","user":{"login":"Slair1","id":17735593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzM1NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17735593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1","html_url":"https://github.com/Slair1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53519554,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzUxOTU1NA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"Slair1/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Slair1","id":17735593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzM1NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17735593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1","html_url":"https://github.com/Slair1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Slair1/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

a user shuts down their VM from the guest OS (and VM HA is enabled), the VM just powers itself back on.  Our environment is on KVM hosts.\r\n\r\nCloudStack does not know the difference between a VM failing or being shutdown from within the guest OS.\r\n\r\nThis is a major pain point for all our users - especially since they don't pay for VMs when they are shutoff.  It is not intuitive for end-users to understand why they can't shutdown VMs from within the guest OS.  Especially when they all come from (non-cloudstack) VMware and Hyper-V environments where this is not an issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a host fails, we need VM HA to still work.\r\n\r\nThis PR that creates a configuration option \"ha.vm.restart.hostup\".  With this option set to false, if CloudStack sees a VM shutdown out-of-band, but the host it was on is still *online*, then it won't power the VM back on.  The logic is that since the host is online, it was most likely shutdown from the guest OS.\r\n\r\nFor when a host actually fails, standard VM HA logic takes over and powers on VMs (if they have VM HA enabled) if the host they were on fails.\r\n\r\nIf that \"ha.vm.restart.hostup\" option is true (the default to match current functionality), it works like always, and even in-guest shutdowns of VMs causes CloudStack to power back on the VM.\r\n\r\n ","created_at":"2018-03-01T21:09:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T07:43:39Z","closed_at":"2018-05-21T07:43:38Z","merged_at":"2018-05-21T07:43:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f23278a4381d57ac167835d2ff625dc4d61978fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/5/labels","id":3033298,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAzMzI5OA==","number":5,"title":"4.11.1.0","description":"Milestone covering PRs for the next 4.11.1.0 release.

the KVM heartbeat file can't be written to, the host is rebooted, and thus taking down all VMs running on it.  The code does try 5x times before the reboot, but the there is not a delay between the retires, so they are 5 simultaneous retries, which doesn't help.  Standard SAN storage HA operations or quick network blip could cause this reboot to occur.\r\n\r\nSome discussions on the dev mailing list revealed that some people are just commenting out the reboot line in their version of the CloudStack source.\r\n\r\nA better option would be have it sleep between tries so it isn't 5x almost simultaneous tries.  Plus, instead of rebooting, the cloudstack-agent could just be stopped on the host instead.  This will cause alerts to be issued and if the host is disconnected long-enough, depending on the HA code in use, VM HA could handle the host failure.\r\n\r\nThe built-in reboot of the host seemed

new CA framework introduced basic support for comma-separated\r\nlist of management servers for agent, which makes an external LB\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis extends that feature to implement LB sorting algorithms that\r\nsorts the management server list before they are sent to the agents.\r\nThis adds a central intelligence in the management server and adds\r\nadditional enhancements to Agent class to be algorithm aware and\r\nhave a background mechanism to check/fallback to preferred management\r\nserver (assumed as the first in the list). This is support for any\r\nindirect agent such as the KVM, CPVM and SSVM agent, and would\r\nprovide support for management server host migration during upgrade\r\n(when instead of in-place, new hosts are used to setup new mgmt server).\r\n\r\nThis FR introduces two new global settings:\r\n\r\n- `indirect.agent.lb.algorithm`: The algorithm for the indirect agent LB.\r\n- `indirect.agent.lb.check.interval`: The preferred host check interval\r\n  for the agent's background task that checks and switches to agent's\r\n  preferred host.\r\n\r\nThe indirect.agent.lb.algorithm supports following algorithm options:\r\n\r\n- static: use the list as provided.\r\n- roundrobin: evenly spreads hosts across management servers based on\r\n  host's id.\r\n- shuffle: (pseudo) randomly sorts the list (not recommended for production).\r\n\r\nAny changes to the global settings - `indirect.agent.lb.algorithm` and\r\n`host` does not require restarting of the mangement server(s) and the\r\nagents. A message bus based system dynamically reacts to change in these\r\nglobal settings and propagates them to all connected agents.\r\n\r\nComma-separated management server list is propagated to agents on\r\nfollowing cases:\r\n- Addition of a host (including ssvm, cpvm systevms).\r\n- Connection or reconnection by the agents to a management server.\r\n- After admin changes the 'host' and/or the\r\n  'indirect.agent.lb.algorithm' global settings.\r\n\r\nOn the agent side, the 'host' setting is saved in its properties file as:\r\n`host=<comma separated addresses>@<algorithm name>`.\r\n\r\nFirst the agent connects to the management server and sends its current\r\nmanagement server list, which is compared by the management server and\r\nin case of failure a new/update list is sent for the agent to persist.\r\n\r\nFrom the agent's perspective, the first address in the propagated list\r\nwill be considered the preferred host. A new background task can be\r\nactivated by configuring the `indirect.agent.lb.check.interval` which is\r\na cluster level global setting from CloudStack and admins can also\r\noverride this by configuring the 'host.lb.check.interval' in the\r\n`agent.properties` file.\r\n\r\nEvery time agent gets a ms-host list and the algorithm, the host specific\r\nbackground check interval is also sent and it dynamically reconfigures\r\nthe background task without need to restart agents.\r\n\r\nNote: The 'static' and 'roundrobin' algorithms, strictly checks for the\r\norder as expected by them, however, the 'shuffle' algorithm just checks\r\nfor content and not the order of the comma separate ms host addresses.\r\n\r\n@blueorangutan

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-10305\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition in the monitoring of the migration process on KVM. If the monitor wakes up in the tight window after the migration succeeds, but before the migration thread terminates, the monitor will get a LibvirtException “Domain not found: no domain with matching uuid” when checking on the migration status. This in turn causes CloudStack to sync the VM state to stop, in which it issues a defensive StopCommand to ensure it is correctly synced.\r\n\r\nFix: Prevent `LibvirtException: \"Domain not found\"` caused by the call to `dm.getInfo()`","created_at":"2018-02-22T14:49:33Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:49:36Z","closed_at":"2018-02-26T14:31:52Z","merged_at":"2018-02-26T14:31:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"703054964a9bae27a563412c35166bae515d10e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/5/labels","id":3033298,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAzMzI5OA==","number":5,"title":"4.11.1.0","description":"Milestone covering PRs for the next 4.11.1.0 release.

ACL rules editing/addition page is not user-friendly. Users are not able to see in a single view all of the detail of the ACL rule (they need to use a scroll bar on the horizontal). The problem becomes worse when there are a considerable number of rules. Therefore, we are proposing the following changes:\r\n\r\n1- Instead of using the table to create new ACL, we can create a button like the one presented in attached pictures, where users can click, and then a modal popup would appear and users would be able to create the new ACL there. This is similar to the workings of the ACL edit button.\r\n2 - Remove the ability to add new ACL via table where they are presented. All ACLs should be entered via the “New ACL” button. Therefore, the section “Add ACL” would be removed as well;\r\n3 - Move the action section of the list ACL table to the most left position;\r\n\r\nThese changes would reduce the information in the table and facilitate users to add new rules and easily edit them as well.\r\n\r\nThe previous described changes will create a page similar to the

Description\r\nACS accounts the resources when deploying VMs with custom service offerings. However, there are other methods (such as updateResourceCount) that do not execute the resource accounting properly, and these methods update the resource count for an account in the database. Therefore, if a user deploys VMs with custom service offerings, and later this user calls the “updateResourceCount” method, it (the method) will only account for VMs with normal service offerings, and update this as the number of resources used by the account. This will result in a smaller number of resources to be accounted for the given account than the real used value. The problem becomes worse because if the user starts to delete these VMs, it is possible to reach negative values of resources allocated (breaking all of the resource limiting for accounts). This is a very serious attack vector for public cloud providers!\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new account and dedicate some resources to it\r\n2. Instantiate a VM using a custom service offering\r\n3. Check the CPU and memory resource count for the given VM (the count must be correct at this point): select * from resource_count where account_id = ?\r\n4. Go to the details of the account and click on “Update resource count”\r\n5. Execute the SQL again (select * from resource_count where account_id = ?), and check if the resource count is correct. The value of resource count will consider only VMs deployed with normal service offering;\r\n6. Delete all VMs\r\n7. Check the resource count table again. It will reach negative values.","created_at":"2018-02-01T13:05:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T11:16:31Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T14:07:39Z","merged_at":"2018-02-23T14:07:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"06ef61b96da328baf863c2da2612f3d6089c04da","assignee":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcaurele","id":1081566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele","html_url":"https://github.com/marcaurele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcaurele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4/labels","id":3009550,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAwOTU1MA==","number":4,"title":"4.12.0.0","description":"Milestone for PRs targetted for the next major 4.12.0.0 release.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new API to collect and list CPU Sockets Metrics information for each hypervisor. Currently, listHosts API is fired for each hypervisor seprately to retrieve the count of CPU sockets. So, with this fix instead of multiple API execution, single API query will be executed to reterieve information for all the hypervisors.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Introduced a new API namely \"listCpuSocketsMetrics\", which will fetch details of CPU Sockets for all the hypervisors in a single run. \r\n2. In this API, a query will be fired on a host table to fetch details based on grouping of Hypervisor type and Hypervisor version.\r\n3. This API will prevent multiple calls of listHosts API and thus will improve performance of the infrastructure tab.\r\n\r\nApi Response Screenshot : \r\n\r\n![api response
