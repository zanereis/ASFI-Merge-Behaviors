xcom_pull functionality got changed to be loaded lazy. This introduced a bug where a session is not properly closed. This only happens when inlets are defined on a task. It pops up on the airflow workers launched by the KubernetesExecutor. There is a database session stuck in idle in transaction for as long as the job is running. This uses precious resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#16081\r\n\r\nThis add a native dashboard page to the UI to gather a few useful metrics to monitor your airflow cluster.\r\n\r\nUp to now people had to build their own dashboard with third parties tools such as grafana.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not finalized yet but aim to gather feedback on the general structure, UI or any other improvement you might want to see in this page before I go ahead and move forward with a more complete implementation.\r\n\r\n- Add a chart library to our front end, leverage another Apache project [Echart](https://github.com/apache/echarts) :tada:  (which is great btw, very flexible and exhaustive library).\r\n- 2 kind of metrics (**live** that uses current data, and **historical** that fetch older records from the db and has filter enabled)\r\n- Everything is auto refreshed\r\n- Live metrics use different REST API calls to fetch information that we have available\r\n- Historical metrics use a single call to a custom private endpoint that fetch everything we need. (Could split that and integrate it to the REST API but we would need some standards for KPIs endpoint and generic way of fetching that to be consistent across resources, i.e how to pass the columns of interest, aggregation type, validation standard payload response etc...). We could do that in a separate PR because this would require on it's own some effort\r\n- UI is responsive and wraps as needed. (Could definitely be improved)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Fix colors by plugin in `STATE_COLORS` and Chakra theme / harmonize the palette\r\n- [x] Factorize some front end components (maybe with compound components)\r\n- [ ] ~~Memoize options if needed~~ (no gain identified)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/14861206/14a372b1-131f-42bc-b984-54455a15454b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/14861206/fd1dbf81-7b0f-40f7-86cc-fc360d671766)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/14861206/a3d323ba-1126-447f-aec9-79bab6e8e6ac)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/14861206/e690f000-7d51-40b4-a403-7f096b107843)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-07T16:00:46Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T19:18:22Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T21:17:41Z","merged_at":"2023-06-01T21:17:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"d67b38365d7f97a6ba334135d45535e8525f5979","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

submitting a Python Apache Beam job using DataflowRunner with `BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator` having NO env. var. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set will make the code rely on `gcloud auth application-default login` credentials.\r\n\r\nPython documentation of the method is unclear whether `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` should always point to the credential with type `service_account`, otherwise it shouldn't be set (e.g. it would be wrong to set it to credential of type `authorized_user`).\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour:\r\n- code assumes when env. var. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set for the credential to be of type `service_account`, and fails otherwise.\r\n- code assumes when env.var. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not set, and `gcloud config application-default login` is applied, the credential has to be of type `authorized_user`, and fails otherwise.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nDoc explicitly states what credentials types are supported.\r\n\r\nDoc used:\r\n-

Add batch_size param for Vertex AI BatchPredictionJob objects.\r\n\r\nVertex AI python sdk has [BatchPredictionJob.create method](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform.BatchPredictionJob#google_cloud_aiplatform_BatchPredictionJob_create), introduced with [the 1.13.1 version](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/pull/1194/files). So the PR updates with passing `batch_size` param:\r\n\r\n- Reference to the SDK (locally on my machine the project from scratch takes 1.16, the update should be safe)\r\n- `CreateBatchPredictionJobOperator`\r\n- `BatchPredictionJobHook`\r\n- Unit tests\r\n\r\nWhen the `batch_size` is [introduced in 1.13](https://github.com/googleapis/python-aiplatform/commit/50bdb01504740ed31de788d8a160f3e2be7f55df),  `create_request_timeout` had already been there, so this param is also added to avoid any confuse.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is pretty simple.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

overwriting of location with default value, when a region is provided.\r\n\r\n### **TL/DR**\r\nWhen the `DataflowTemplateOperator` is being migrated from Airflow 1 to Airflow 2, if `region` property is setup with no `location` passing - Fallback anyway throws a message:\r\n\r\n_**The mutually exclusive parameter `location` and `region` key in `variables` parameter are both present. Please remove one.**_\r\n\r\nNew unit tests of operator might explain better - they are not going to pass without the fix.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator` has a parameter `location` with non empty default value. This operator is using the `DataflowHook` object. `DataflowHook` makes a check: if `location` and `region` are setup together at the same time, than throws the exception (like above). Since `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator`'s `location` has a default value, it will always pass non-zero value to the `DataflowHook`.\r\n\r\nAt the same time `DataflowHook` has the same default value for its  `location` parameter, so `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator` can safely pass None value (Special unit test is also added, to make sure `DataflowHook` will use default value when `location` and `region` are not provided at the same time).\r\n\r\n### Notices\r\n\r\nThe same fallback `_fallback_to_location_from_variables` is applied to 4 methods (at the moment of writing):\r\n\r\n1. start_template_dataflow (fixed case)\r\n2. start_java_dataflow (found only definition and unit test references)\r\n3. start_python_dataflow (found only definition and unit test references)\r\n4. is_job_dataflow_running (referenced by `BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator`, `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator` and `DataflowCreateJavaJobOperator` with explicitly no passing `location` and `region` at the same time)\r\n\r\nSo, since other places are not affected, the change can be pretty small and focused on `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator` only.\r\n\r\nP.S. Looks like some other people had the same problem, for example:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70254851/dataflowtemplateoperator-job-failing-on-cloud-composer-after-upgrading-to-airflo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

this due to a real-world case of an HTTP Connection Error causing a task to initially fail to start, after investigating I found the hvac documentation suggested adding this retry process.\r\n\r\nDue to the docker version I have access to and the minimum requirements of Airflow dev tooling I hit limitations in the MyPy pre-commits and running the test suite, but I believe this PR should pass all tests.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any additional work and/or changes to the PR to be able to review and/or land.\r\n\r\nFinally, someone else submitted a similar PR but it is failing due import

resources use `include \"airflow.fullname\" .` helper and some just use `{{ .Release.Name }}`. fullname helper is a common good practice to name all the different helm resources.\r\n\r\nThis allows to customize the resources and leverage the existing options `fullnameOverride` or `nameOverride` and have consistency in all resources to always use `include \"airflow.fullname\" .`\r\n\r\nThis makes it much easier when deploying airflow as a dependency on another chart or in the same namespace, as we can clearly see airflow's chart name \"airflow\" in the resources and/or allow to customize the prefix for all airflow resources\r\n\r\nThe proposed helm chart was deployed in my local environment and all names match properly between deployments, secrets, configmaps, etc.","created_at":"2023-05-04T17:13:52Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T17:13:49Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T00:06:40Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T00:06:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a828f393b220abbcd3a751bf98a6ec003776c1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1971984525,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcxOTg0NTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:helm-chart","name":"area:helm-chart","color":"024e91","default":false,"description":"Airflow

is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24588 which was closed due to a fork sync'ing issue. From the original PR by @ChrisFraun:\r\n\r\n>**What**: Deployments can have security settings in their manifest on two levels: pod and container. However, there are some capabilities only configurable in one of the respective levels(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#securitycontext-v1-core). This PR sets a default configuration for container securityContext, which denies privilege escalation and drops all POSIX capabilities. These are and should be standard settings in the context of Kubernetes. It also adds the possibility of running Airflow in an Kubernetes environment without PSP (to be removed in v1.25 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/), but with OpenPolicyAgent (a or possibly the PSP substitute) with the same capabilities as a restricted PSP instead.\r\n**Why**: This missing configuration restricts Airflow from being used with the simple upstream helm chart without modifications/unnecessary maintenance. This especially applies to the restricted policy use in OPA. The specific setting in this PR is not inherited from podSecurityContext(pod level) in securityContext(container level).\r\n**Problem**: There is already a securityContext in the values.yaml, however, this should also be be called podSecurityContext since it's on pod level, but it isn't. To not break backwards compatibility of Airflow, this PR hardcodes the respective capabilities on container level for statsd, scheduler and webserver.\r\nThe other possibility would be to introduce a containerSecurityContext in the values.yaml, which is a made up word since it is commonly called scurityContext.\r\nBenefit in either case would be a more secure deployment.\r\n\r\ncloses: #27612\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Overview\r\nThis PR aims to improve the time it takes to load/import the Celery executor module.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nExecutors are imported in more places now that various compatibility checks are in core Airflow code (re: AIP-51). Also, decreasing import times is very important for the work of executors vending CLI commands (see #29055), since the CLI code in Airflow is particularly sensitive to slow imports (because all code is loaded fresh each time you run an individual Airflow CLI command).\r\n\r\n### The changes\r\nMove some expensive typing related imports to be under TYPE_CHECKING.\r\n\r\nAlso move some imports to runtime imports, closer to their usage.\r\n\r\n1. Move some expensive typing related imports to be under TYPE_CHECKING.\r\n1. Refactor expensive classes and methods (other than the CeleryExecutor) out of the `celery_executor.py` module into a utils module so that they are only loaded at runtime.\r\n1. Also move some imports closer to their usage.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI benchmarked these changes by writing a script to import the executor module in a fresh python runtime and timing how long that takes (you can test this yourself quickly from a bash shell by doing something like `time python -c 'from airflow.executors.local_executor import CeleryExecutor'`). Then doing that in a loop for several samples (with some randomness in the order for fairness) both on main and on my development branch.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-05-01 15-18-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/235543397-c59b8bc0-e37e-432e-bb99-34709d4d0955.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change adds full automation for keeping and updating min airflow version for all community providers.\r\n\r\nIt makes sure that:\r\n\r\n* all non-preinstalled providers have min-airflow-version set properly\r\n* all providers (including the preinstalled ones) additionally perform a runtime check on whether correct version of Airflow is installed.\r\n* allows for exceptional cases for some providers to be set\r\n* all providers have `version` added and exported in their `__init__.py`\r\n\r\nUsually just setting the airflow version in requirements should be enough, but since we have to install runtime check for preinstalled providers, it's easier to add the runtime check for all providers, and it will be additional verification that airflow version is properly set. Additionally, we can export correct version in the automatically generated `__init__.py` for all providers.\r\n\r\nThe pre-installed providers cannot have explicit minimum airflow version specified as requirement, because this would create a dependency cycle with Airflow, and while such dependency cycle is fine for `pip`, other tools that analyse dependencies get confused and produce errors, claiming there cannot be dependenc cycles in the dependency tree (which is not generally a hard requirement, package dependency graph does not have to be DAG and it can contain cycles).\r\n\r\nThis is why we have to add runtime check in the preinstalled providers to fail when they are installed with older Airflow versions than the ones that are supported by our policy.\r\n\r\nThis PR automates maintenance of all the versions involved during prepearation of release documentation - it has been somewhat manual procedure so far, because it was only set in provider.yaml, but since now we set it in several places, it requires automation and single source of truth (which is prepare_provider_packages.py script that is used for preparation of provider documenation and packages.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#22303\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a change to the [`PubSubHook.publish`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/_api/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/pubsub/index.html#airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.pubsub.PubSubHook.publish) method. I updated the method signature to include support for string-type message data. Previously, the operator only allowed byte-type message data, which made it complicated for users to use templated message data. For example, the following would not work.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith DAG(...):\r\n    @task\r\n    def create_messages():\r\n        return json.dumps([{\"data\": \"hello world\"}])\r\n\r\n    publish_messages = PubSubPublishMessageOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"publish_messages\",\r\n        project=\"test\",\r\n        topic=\"test\",\r\n        messages=\"{{ ti.xcom_pull('create_messages') }}\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    create_messages() >> publish_messages\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince bytes-type data is not JSON serializable, the only way to make the above example work is to set [`render_template_as_native_obj=True`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/operators.html#rendering-fields-as-native-python-objects) alongside a custom jinja2 filter to convert the xcom value to bytes.\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef to_bytes(value):\r\n    return value.encode(\"utf-8\")\r\n\r\nwith DAG(..., render_template_as_native_obj=True, user_defined_filters={\"to_bytes\": to_bytes}):\r\n    @task\r\n    def create_messages():\r\n        return json.dumps([{\"data\": \"hello world\"}])\r\n\r\n    publish_messages = PubSubPublishMessageOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"publish_messages\",\r\n        project=\"test\",\r\n        topic=\"test\",\r\n        messages=\"{{ ti.xcom_pull('create_messages') | to_bytes }}\"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    create_messages() >> publish_messages\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, users can now easily use templated message data in string format, making the operator more versatile and user-friendly. The changes are backward compatible, so existing operators can continue to use bytes-type message data.","created_at":"2023-05-01T02:53:42Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T00:10:56Z","closed_at":"2023-05-09T00:10:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7015b7afd867e9e3a088c7b1316f712f25467f10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google
