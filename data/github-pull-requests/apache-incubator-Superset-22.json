this idea around addressing the comment here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27979#pullrequestreview-1994777679 , introducing action-specific pinning.\r\n\r\nI tested that this works nicely when running `pip-compile-multi -P pre-commit`, allowing us to bump pre-commit or any lib across the bundles.\r\n\r\nSubmitting for comment, but both reverting and installing `requirements/development.txt` seem reasonable, curious what others think.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n- we want to insure consistency between development.txt and this new pin file (I think pip-complile-multi would ensure that from my understanding)\r\n- we wouldn't want to install all of superset and its deps to support that one action ...

SUMMARY\r\nFixes a bug where the `onChange` event was being fired with an incorrect value when pasting a text that corresponds to an existing option in the database, which was not loaded previously due to pagination.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/b6f340ec-0e4a-450b-be38-e4b1181c5dda\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/305eb0f0-74ac-4053-a836-f877df2bc951\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Use an async select that has enough values to trigger pagination. You can also reduce the Select's default page size to test.\r\n2 - Paste a value that is not loaded yet by the Select component\r\n3 - Check that the `onChange` event is called with the correct value. It's easier to check this when the options have numeric values. In that case, `onChange` should receive the numeric value instead of the pasted text as the value property.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-11T19:07:42Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:45:20Z","closed_at":"2024-04-12T14:08:06Z","merged_at":"2024-04-12T14:08:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"06077d42a8b49dfa8789b2a4b0abcfb5b4d96c49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5767284349,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABV8HGfQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v4.0","name":"v4.0","color":"83D477","default":false,"description":"Label

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the platform renders any HTML command in the result table, which can sometimes obscure the full HTML in the request body. To address this, an option button that enables users to control the rendering of HTML in the result table is added. This option would provide users with more flexibility and clarity when viewing HTML content within SQLLab, as well as in table chart. This addition is also discussed in [this lazy consensus](https://lists.apache.org/thread/1y4rxnply1m7xonnwro2b12f276vc2hm).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before** \r\n\r\n_**SQL Lab**_\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"Screenshot 2567-04-10 at 15 35 32\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/e8cccbb6-4ec3-4707-9be1-5bef8a1be720\"><br/>\r\n_**Table Chart**_\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"Screenshot 2567-04-10 at 15 36 02\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/a5a0ac1a-cf23-42e1-afa6-f3e28b2a8c18\">\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n_**SQL Lab**_\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/b8e5161c-c7bb-4c72-b977-277cf52de259\r\n\r\n\r\n_**Table Chart**_\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/24c58851-c461-4b7d-bd47-49b9436b576b\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPer ASF Infra, GA/GTM and Google-hosted fonts are not allowed. This GA/GTM account is vestigial anyway (likely would've been disabled anyway since we certainly didn't upgrade to GA4), but let's just chop it out. The Google Fonts are now replaced with local files, which are under Apache 2.0 licensing.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR implements a new property on the Dashboard model granting access to the tabs associated with a dashboard. A new API endpoint for accessing the associated dashboard tabs has been created at `/api/v1/dashboard/[id]/tabs`.\r\n\r\nThe payload of the api endpoint contains two properties: `all_tabs` which contains an array of all associated tabs, and `tab_tree` which contains a nested object representing the nested structure of tabs within the dashboard. tab_tree follows the data structure necessary for consumption by the Antd Tree and TreeSelect components on the frontend.\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for this implementation is for enabling the functionalities described in SIP: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26183.\r\n\r\nThe provided proof of concept provides an alternative approach, centralizing the business logic on the backend to process prior to serving to the client.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/41238731/0587a258-9643-43a9-89c8-4e130b15f491)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\n\nI believe the intention is to have the docs\naligned with what is on `master`, currently pushing on a release\nbranch will trigger a potential regression.\n\nIt could be reasonable for the docs to be aligned with the latest\nrelease, but if that was the intention we should deploy the\ndocs as part of the release process, and avoid previous release branch\nfrom deploying the docs.\n\nI think this happened by mistake on\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27390/files#diff-1f3b6eaac4370772e5f0d6cebab7906e0a83ce78e07f6ae8a239c06b33a420d4R9\nwhen the intention was to trigger CI on release branches, not to deploy\nthe docs.\n\n\n","created_at":"2024-04-09T21:43:34Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:45:51Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T00:03:09Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T00:03:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6d16ed4773d6aeea118682884ee22d40a80f6df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen firing the `docker-compose up` command, which is pretty much the first step of most developer workflows, we kick off up 2 chromium downloads: one for PLAYWRIGHT and one for PUPPETEER by default. Those are used for optional features like alerts/reports/thumbnails/ and for CI.\r\n\r\nMy approach here to prevent all this work when running `docker-compose up` is to:\r\n- playwright: move the download/install to the `Dockerfile` in the `dev` layer\r\n- pupeteer: turn off by default. From my understanding this is only really required for a CI step, and is implemented there. I don't think developers are meant to have this locally. But note that you can still turn it on by switching a env var.\r\n\r\nAs a side mission, since I needed it while working on this, I'm also introducing support for defining environment variables overrides for docker-compose in `docker/.env-local` while adding this to `.gitignore`, which developers can use without the fear/confusion around committing local environment specific settings to the repo.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAbout the core feature in this PR here, this saves minutes upon firing `docker-compose up`, and reduce confusion\r\naround \"what the heck is it doing!?\", in a phase where we should just be pulling and starting docker images.\r\n\r\n#### More about PUPPETEER\r\nAbout PUPPETEER: in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22623, I found that it is used by Applitool in two GHAs:\r\n- (superset-applitool-cypress)[https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/.github/workflows/superset-applitool-cypress.yml]\r\n- (superset-applitools-storybook)[https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/.github/workflows/superset-applitools-storybook.yml]\r\n\r\nSeems PUPPETEER is probably never really useful locally.\r\n\r\n#### More about PLAYWRIGHT \r\n\r\nAbout PLAYWRIGHT, this is what powers alerts and reports as well thumbnail-generation.\r\n\r\n### Potential follow up work\r\n- decide on Chromium VS Firefox as the primary webdriver to power those features, and remove the other one from the docker image as it bloats it with whichever one is not in use\r\n- use playwright to download the Firefox webdriver as right now it's a hot mess of wget tarballs, and it seemed playwright wraps this up nicely\r\n- Dockerfile refactor: currently this layer is low in the docker pipeline, any layer rebuild before this one will retrigger the download of the browser. Eventually we could compose docker images to prevent this. I've been talking about setting up some \"fit\" and \"fat\" images for a while, which would include the web driver(s). Currently only `dev` has this.","created_at":"2024-04-09T20:29:14Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:45:38Z","closed_at":"2024-04-12T23:07:49Z","merged_at":"2024-04-12T23:07:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"40e77be813c789c8b01aece739f32ff5753436b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=",

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds an utility function to render chart tooltips with the following objectives:\r\n- Add the ability to display total and percentage values for our tooltips. This improvement will also allow us to migrate legacy timeseries charts, which currently display that information, to ECharts.\r\n- Standardize the way we display tooltips. Currently, every plugin displays tooltips using different information and designs, which decreases the overall user experience. By creating a reusable function, we can ensure consistency across plugins.\r\n- Reduce code duplication.\r\n\r\nThis PR will only format ECharts tooltips to limit the scope of work but other plugins can also benefit from the utility function.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1089\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 10 40 12\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe main driver for this PR was to enrich event logging around database engine and database drivers for events that interact directly with analytics databases. While touching this up, I did some refactor along the way.\r\n\r\n- Adding a new analytics event/action `execute_sql` that targets just that, that **isn't** called when hitting the cache for instance. Using the context manager insures capturing the duration of the call as well.\r\n- refactored logic duplication around config items `SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR` and `MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT`, where code had been copy/pasted and reimplemented in various places. Here I move it as a method of the Database model.\r\n- side mission: I realized that `request.form` is empty when posting JSON payload, and `request.json` should be used instead. This should automatically capture more automated logging that parses context out of the request object proactively\r\n- factored out `post_process_df` as it seemed logical to isolate this out of `get_df`\r\n- fix cypress glitch + improved cypress docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-08T21:47:51Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:44:14Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T23:30:50Z","merged_at":"2024-04-22T23:30:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"cfc440c56cb973bd3202ab8d7daabbbde888704a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

SUMMARY\r\nWhen applying a time_offset in Advanced Analytics, if the row_limit is too small, data will not be present when the join occurs, so this PR prevent such behavior by not using limit nor offset in the inner query (the shifted one).\r\n\r\nFor example this query shown in the following video has all the records for a period of 10+ years:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/8dca8b16-5c05-4b2d-8fd6-67387c8708e7\r\n\r\nWe can see that the result of shifted queries not always include the same periods than the original query, so when the join gets applied, it won't match some records, thus giving you incorrect output.\r\n\r\nOriginal query with limit and sorting:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 08 04 2024 a 11 05

datapoints are missing in the shifted columns because they are not part of the result dataframe after sorting and limiting it like the original query.\r\n![error](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/7fe6bdb0-b527-4d40-b067-f79f56f68668)\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nNow we can see that the query is able to find the records that belong to those offsets regardless, because it's joining using the complete data.\r\n![test](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/4d018be1-ad8c-42b6-a4a0-85123d8f480e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n- Added `philippines_regions.geojson` map using the regional ISO codes\r\n- Updates `philippines.geojson` by dividing Maguindanao province to Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur, as well as splintering off Davao Occidental from Davao del Sur\r\n- Cleans `philippines.geojson` by incorporating the inconsistently placed highly urbanized cities (which sometimes uses a pseudo-ISO code) into their respective geographical provinces. This is done to be more in line with how the Philippine Statistics Authority does it in their census.\r\n- Merges the 16 cities and 1 municipality within Metropolitan Manila under the regional ISO code `PH-00` since there is no provincial ISO for the cities within.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- [ISO-3166-2:PH codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:PH)\r\n- [2020 Philippine Census by the Philippine Statistics Authority](https://psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-philippine-population-2020-census-population-and-housing-2020-cph)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![ph_div](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/146858759/977254cc-9d47-447e-9362-30b9ce8c8fe5)\r\n![ph_prov_mm](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/146858759/318d3094-c4b8-49a9-a8e4-8cc9e98eaace)\r\n![ph_prov_luzon](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/146858759/4f8286a5-9df7-4c2c-9fa4-a99323bed19d)\r\n![ph_prov_visayas](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/146858759/7c753934-fee4-4078-b69e-dc4b5bc7fd51)\r\n![ph_prov_mindanao](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/146858759/d55762ea-afc5-43a6-a7b9-5b304086984e)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n[this is DRAFT but is a bit of a request for comment]\r\n\r\nI recently realized that even shallow clones of this repo are pretty large, with a fair amount of that coming from video and image files.\r\n\r\nHere I setup the large video in our README to be stored in git lfs as well as image files for the docs.\r\n\r\nThis change should be 100% seamless for anyone who has git-lfs installed (and GitHub Actions have it on by default, meaning a normal clone/checkout operation will fetch the lfs assets) and shouldn't affect common workflows.\r\n\r\nWhat I did to setup this PR:\r\n```bash\r\ngit lfs track *.mp4\r\ngit lfs track docs/static/img/*.jpg\r\ngit lfs track docs/static/img/*.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, to reap the benefits in CI, I'm setting up all of the `actions/checkout` (except for the docs-building ones) to systematically **not** bring those files as they aren't required for most CI workloads, with the exception of building docs. \r\n\r\nGiven the load on CI and how much we checkout the repo there, this should have a significant impact on speed and bandwidth of CI. I estimated about 1/2 the size from this handful of files\r\n\r\nNote that this change only affects the repo moving forward, meaning only shallow clones will see a benefit. Also note that by default all `action/checkout` are shallow clones by default. Also note that there is a possibility of doing this retroactively, but it requires modifying git history (possibly affecting all shas/refs) and I would not recommend that at this time.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- [] test that docs will build properly in CI\r\n- [] test that the mp4 video is accessible on the branch\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-05T19:35:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T06:40:55Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T22:27:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"149d7a3580f95e85c00fa8ff0b25ee413b0267e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nDocs search wasn't working... @sfirke updated the module (thanks!), but I later saw there's an API key error in my browser console. I searched Algolia for that key, and it looks like they may have rotated it. This is the new one! \r\n\r\nTested locally, and it works.\r\n\r\nFor those that are thinking \"you can't just drop a key into your code like this!,\"  Algolia states:\r\n\r\n> This is the public API key which can be safely used in your frontend code.This key is usable for search queries and it's also able to list the indices you've got access to.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

next version of python as @villebro suggested, same as we've been doing for integration tests\r\n- simplifying the single-item matrix (python-version) to NOT using a matrix. I'm guessing the reason we currently have a single-item matrix is an artifact of supporting multiple version in the past, and/or making it easy to go multi-python-version checks in the future, but there's a burden associated, especially around how this relates to \"required checks\" specified in .asf.yml\r\n- fixing/simplifying the related no-op workflows. We'll need new ones, but will be able to deprecate a bunch and simplify things. For instance, when we migrate to 3.11 in the future, we won't have to manage a bunch of python-version-specific no-ops\r\n\r\nAbout supporting multiple/future version of python, I'd argue that we should focus on a single one for a given CI run, and that if/when we need to CI against multiple version, we run a FULL test suite punctually in a dedicate PR/branch/ref. Point being, it's expensive for every commit to validate multiple versions of python and in many ways its not necessary.\r\n\r\nCurrently our multi-python-version support is dubious at best, with only few checks that run against multiple versions. I really think we should pick a single version and support it very well. If/when we want to upgrade python version, we'd cut a PR and run CI for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we want to continuously, actively support multiple python versions (and I don't think we should!), I'd suggest either\r\na release-specific procedure (release manager using release branch, running full CI for that version/release) and/or a nightly job that would keep an eye on that version of python.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-04T17:34:11Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:45:52Z","closed_at":"2024-04-10T21:32:30Z","merged_at":"2024-04-10T21:32:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"dea430649dd8c940e4db973577f9c8e2493b40b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRecently with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27867 (upgrading) pylint, we discovered that many python-related checks that should have run didn't run. The conditional execution system was uneven and showing different issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR streamline the whole conditional execution of github actions across the board.\r\n\r\nThe problem:\r\n- many, imperfect ways to do file change detection \r\n  - native GHA `paths` triggers that are incompatible with \"required checks\" (and require no-op.yml, to the script)\r\n  - a shell script that's a bit cryptic and a bit verbose and error-prone\r\n- actions that should be conditional but aren't set up that way\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n- creation of a single reusable action for all file-based conditional execution\r\n- introducing `scripts/change_detector.py`, a simple script inspired by `scripts/ci_check_no_file_changes.sh`, but more advanced and readable, handling both the pull_request and push context\r\n- moving all actions with file-related triggers to using this\r\n- getting rid of the `no-op.yml` hack altogether\r\n\r\n### TESTING\r\nA fair amount of manual testing here, triggering with/without python/frontend/docker changes and making sure that the right steps get executed or skippped","created_at":"2024-04-04T15:58:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:46:08Z","closed_at":"2024-04-08T23:20:25Z","merged_at":"2024-04-08T23:20:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"e80d194b8f211d4064972b6a9377feb2911fe6d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"logi

SUMMARY\r\nAs per issue #27897,  SqlAlchemy recommends that \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThe typical usage of [create_engine()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine) is once per particular database URL, held globally for the lifetime of a single application process. A single [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine) manages many individual [DBAPI](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/glossary.html#term-DBAPI) connections on behalf of the process and is intended to be called upon in a concurrent fashion. The [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine) is not synonymous to the DBAPI connect() function, which represents just one connection resource - the [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine) is most efficient when created just once at the module level of an application, not per-object or per-function call.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nThe superset.models.core::Database class is currently allocating Engine objects whenever a Database object is instantiated which happens twice(?) per 'api/v1/chart/data' API access. This is not the intended usage of the SQL Alchemy API and causes mechanisms such as connection pooling not to work correctly.\r\n\r\nConnection pooling is an important feature in order to control access to databases. For instance when using 'duckdb', it is recommended that one uses a small number of concurrent requests (or a single concurrent request) and instead take advantage of the inherent parallelism in the database engine. Other engines will have other ideal settings.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nConfigure a connection pool using the `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR` hook.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

[fetch-retry](https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry) from 4.1.1 to 6.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/releases\">fetch-retry's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Permissive wrapping, fix global pollution and export types</h2>\n<p>Adds permissive wrapping of the <code>fetch</code> function while retaining the original typing of the wrapped library. This enables us to handle that there are slight variations between <code>fetch</code> implementations in node.</p>\n<p>This change also removes the need for the triple-slash directive which polluted the global namespace with DOM typings. The new version also exports all the types defined in the library for good measure.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/alecmev\"><code>@​alecmev</code></a> for providing an excellent PR which made these changes possible.</p>\n<h2>Type definition of the defaults parameter</h2>\n<p>Adds type definition for the <code>defaults</code> parameter in the <code>fetchBuilder</code> function. Previously it was mistakenly typed as <code>object</code> which was not very helpful.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/simeonborko\"><code>@​simeonborko</code></a> for reporting the issue and providing the PR.</p>\n<h2>Fix type definition to support URL instance</h2>\n<p>Fixes a bug where URL instances could not be passed as the first argument to the wrapped fetch function.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/afmelsaidy\"><code>@​afmelsaidy</code></a> for reporting the issue and providing a pull request.</p>\n<h2>Adds example on how to use with Node.js fetch and fixes failing tests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds an example on how to use with Node.js fetch API which became available in version 18.</li>\n<li>Fixes failing tests when running Node.js version 18, which failed due to using an older version of node-fetch, resulting in having multiple versions of the <code>Request</code> object.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Security updates: minimist</h2>\n<p>Updated dependencies and fixed security issues reported in dependencies, most notably minimist.</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes and security fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pwambach\"><code>@​pwambach</code></a> fixed an issue where typescript definition no longer was valid. The fix was to use a default export instead.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bamse16\"><code>@​bamse16</code></a> fixed an issue where npm install for <code>production</code> and <code>ci</code> would fail due to <code>husky</code> being defined as a dev dependency</li>\n<li>Security fixes, including a <code>high</code> severity issue for <code>node-fetch</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for all the contributions, and apologies for taking a long time to merge the fixes.</p>\n<h2>Bug fix for node environment</h2>\n<p>Fixes a bug (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/63\">#63</a>) introduced in version 5.0.0 where support for the <code>Request</code> argument was added. The initial implementation introduced a runtime error for the node environment.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/paulrosania\"><code>@​paulrosania</code></a> for reporting the issue, and to <a href=\"https://github.com/knotthere\"><code>@​knotthere</code></a> for creating a PR with the suggested fix.</p>\n<h2>Improvements and bug fix</h2>\n<p>This release includes a bundle of improvements and a bug fix. Due to the renaming of the <code>IRequestInitWithRetry</code> interface, I have created a new major release to attempt to mitigate any potential breaking changes.</p>\n<p>Included in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>IRequestInitWithRetry</code> to <code>RequestInitWithRetry</code> and export the interface (<a href=\"https://github.com/christophehurpeau\"><code>@​christophehurpeau</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Use rollup.js to support UMD builds (<a href=\"https://github.com/dwiyatci\"><code>@​dwiyatci</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Adding support for Request argument (<a href=\"https://github.com/knotthere\"><code>@​knotthere</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Added integration tests for Request argument and URL type (<a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern\"><code>@​jonbern</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Added husky pre-commit script to build project and run tests (<a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern\"><code>@​jonbern</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Upgrade dependencies to fix security warnings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many thanks for all the contributions for improving this project. It is greatly appreciated! 🙏</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/8684ef4e688375f623bd76f13add76dbc1d67cfb\"><code>8684ef4</code></a> 6.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/e0033eb711afdede5aab211c2e077ace1a61dfa1\"><code>e0033eb</code></a> Renames Fetch to FetchLibrary to better communicate intent of permissive typing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/0647a6b9f58fa70260a6bab57d539acf1fbbcc7b\"><code>0647a6b</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/88\">#88</a> from alecmev/drop-dom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/8ecf2ccc55ad094b57e96af98aa45191a05f466e\"><code>8ecf2cc</code></a> Drop DOM types</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/228661ec3e2cc5c3d8188cf5221125e809badc8f\"><code>228661e</code></a> 5.0.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/0c1dce6af3dfc278d7f318e8f437a6152e2f5ec5\"><code>0c1dce6</code></a> keep RequestInitRetryParams type public to avoid potential breaking change</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/74d8001a998d15575a41055b1460f4f24f350100\"><code>74d8001</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/87\">#87</a> from simeonborko/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/abdf56283c18504fef1e9851f325142c7cb1d293\"><code>abdf562</code></a> Type definition of the defaults parameter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/7023d6889e08afdc35d96c37840a42288f06f64b\"><code>7023d68</code></a> 5.0.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/14ed6fd8310dcb0a417b07408a569d7b8d138b23\"><code>14ed6fd</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/84\">#84</a> from afmelsaidy/master</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/compare/4.1.1...6.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=fetch-retry&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=4.1.1&new-version=6.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFollowing up on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27859, where\r\nI introduced a new file `pyproject.toml` to set up the\r\npython project metadata, here I'd like to consolidate and modernize\r\nfurther by pushing as much as possible into pyproject.toml,\r\nexcept where things need to be dynamic, for which we'll keep using\r\nsetup.py:\r\n\r\n- get rid of setup.cfg, everything there should be able to move to\r\n  pyproject.toml\r\n- remove duplicate keys from setup.py and pyproject.toml\r\n- minimize/simplify setup.py\r\n----\r\n\r\nNOTE: we may be able to chisel a bit more at `setup.py`, but it's going to me needed in some capacity since we have some dynamic parameters, notably the `version` number we read and align from `package.json`. There's a tricky thing related to `entry-points` we could tackle.\r\n\r\nAlso note that having `setup.py` provides continuity for commands like `python setup.py sdist` which is kind of nice.\r\n\r\nIf we decided to make that a goal, we could fully kill `setup.py` and centralize on pyproject.toml, we're well on our way there.","created_at":"2024-04-03T19:55:42Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:45:31Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T21:44:47Z","merged_at":"2024-04-15T21:44:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"c225e17a7558bedf610fa1d71e033e6981553d42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a small refactor of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27631, addressing a different workflow for OAuth2 suggested by @villebro, where any number of OAuth2 clients can be configured and assigned manually to databases.\r\n\r\nThe main change is that the DB engine spec no longer inspects the application config to get the OAuth2 client details (ID, secret, etc.). Instead, the OAuth2 related methods in the DB engine spec now receive a configuration object:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass OAuth2ClientConfig(TypedDict):\r\n    id: str\r\n    secret: str\r\n    scope: str\r\n    redirect_uri: str\r\n    authorization_request_uri: str\r\n    token_request_uri: str\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe configuration is read from the **database model**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\noauth2_config = database.get_oauth2_config()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current implementation simply builds the config object from `superset_config.py`, but in the future the database could check first for a custom OAuth2 client associated with it and use that instead. Similarly, to check if OAuth2 is enabled in a given database we now do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif database.is_oauth2_enabled():\r\n   pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current method also simply checks `superset_config.py` for now.\r\n\r\nHaving a standard configuration being passed to the DB engine spec has helped simplify the OAuth2 related methods. I was able to move the methods from GSheets to the base DB engine spec by adding a few new attributes. All that is needed to support OAuth2 in Gsheets now is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom shillelagh.adapters.api.gsheets.lib import SCOPES\r\n\r\nclass GSheetsEngineSpec(ShillelaghEngineSpec):\r\n\r\n    supports_oauth2 = True\r\n    oauth2_scope = \" \".join(SCOPES)\r\n    oauth2_authorization_request_uri = \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\"\r\n    oauth2_token_request_uri = \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\"\r\n    oauth2_exception = UnauthenticatedError\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_url_for_impersonation(\r\n        cls,\r\n        url: URL,\r\n        impersonate_user: bool,\r\n        username: str | None,\r\n        access_token: str | None,\r\n    ) -> URL:\r\n        if impersonate_user and access_token:\r\n            url = url.update_query_dict({\"access_token\": access_token})\r\n\r\n        return url\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26767 replaced the non-validating `sqlparse` parser with the pseudo-validating `SQLGlot` parser to aid with SQL parsing. The main use case for SQL parsing—from a security perspective—is to identify/extract the underlying tables/views referenced in the statement and checking whether the user is authorized to access them.\r\n\r\nPreviously, given the non-validating nature of `sqlparse`, virtually all SQL statements could be parsed—irrespective of whether they were valid—which meant that any syntax errors were reported by the underlying engine in a pseudo-meaningful manner. Now however, given that `SQLGlot` is more opinionated, syntax errors are detected by `SQLGlot` during the table/view extraction phase meaning that the query is never run and thus the engine's parser is never run resulting in a non-actionable error, i.e., it merely stated that the SQL could not be parsed. This is especially problematic in SQL Lab where freeform SQL is the norm and can be rather lengthy.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is now SQL statements which contain a syntax error are _likely_ going to be captured by `SQLGlot` upstream of being executed by the engine.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes leveraging the messaging from `SQLGlot`'s `ParseError` or `TokenError` ([example](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/README.md#parser-errors)) to provide a more meaningful (and thus actionable) error message to the user.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### PREVIOUS \r\n\r\nPrior to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26767 `sqlparse` was able to \"parse\" the SQL statement—missing an `AND` after the `key = 'foobar'` clause—which was then executed by the Trino engine (given that the user had access to the `datainfra.one_row` table) resulting in the following Trino error,\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 10 47 11 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/44e5f6ef-0030-41fa-bbb4-4b0f2101df0a\">\r\n\r\nwhich detected the error was around the `1` token.\r\n\r\n#### CURRENT\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26767 `SQLGlot` was (rightfully) unable to parse the SQL statement and thus could not extract the underlying tables which halted the execution flow. The resulting error message isn't overly helpful as it doesn't inform the user where the actual syntax error is.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 12 09 58 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/09198f62-0988-43e6-9966-bc0ca7d27370\">\r\n\r\n#### PROPOSED\r\n\r\nLeveraging `SQLGlot`'s `ParseError` et al. exceptions to provide a more meaningful error message,\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 3 42 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/8035ad26-07da-42ec-8349-76917988e2b4\">\r\n\r\nwhich correctly detected the error was around the `1` token. The messaging is loosely based on how MySQL presents errors.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nAs the dashboard currently lacks metadata information such as owners and last modified time, users have to navigate to edit mode and click \"edit properties\" to access this information. Unfortunately, there is no way to check the last modified time at all.\r\nTo address this issue, this commit integrates the metadata bar UI from the chart header into the dashboard header and updates the API properties accordingly.

SUMMARY\r\nTo facilitate the discussion related our experimental feature for time comparison, we're extracting out form [the original PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27355) all the back end changes related to how to create left outer join queries when time comparison is needed. Using JOIN statement would help tackling issues related to `Row Limit` [discussed in this issue](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/27504). Right now we are raising an exception message to users that try to generate these joined queries on databases where JOINs are not supported.\r\n\r\nKnown limitations:\r\n\r\n- This approach only supports one time comparison at the time and doesn't rely on the `time_offset` property in the `QueryObject`, meaning that it's not compatible with existing API that allows for multiple ranges using such property.\r\n- We are raising en exception when JOINs are not supported, we should instead fallback to `time_offset` API that applies the joins on DataFrame level\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe use the `EMAIL_HEADER_MUTATOR` to detect errors in reports sent to our external clients. Currently, when an error is detected we send an alert to an internal Slack channel and replace the contents of the notification with a generic message saying `There has been an issue generating your report...`. However, our account managers have asked us not to send the report. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent the reports from being sent beyond causing an `Exception` to be raised, which causes issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to use `msg.replace_header(\"To\", <superset_admin/empty_string>)` as part of the `EMAIL_HEADER_MUTATOR` in the config to replace the list of recipients. We plan to either replace the recipients with an empty string or send it to an internal email so we are notified of the results. \r\n\r\nI [opened an Idea ](https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/26886)previously for this but it has not been picked up.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI have added an additional unit test in the relevant section of the tests repo.

SUMMARY\r\nOur current Avatars are a little dry, using a limited variety of colors and showing the user's initials. The app could use a little more personality. Now given we already have a slack integration and administrators can configure their `SLACK_API_TOKEN`, I was thinking we can use this integration to get Slack's avatars integrated in Superset. Given the popularity of Slack and users familiarity with the avatars there, I thought it'd be neat to bring a bit more color in Superset.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm also introducing the config `SLACK_ENABLE_AVATARS` which is `False` by default, and added a note to `UPDATING.md` for release managers to switch it on if desired.\r\n\r\nThe approach here is centered around a new endpoint `/api/v1/user/{id}/avatar.png`, which fetches from a new column in\r\nUserAttribute (our one-to-one extension to FAB's User model) name `avatar_url`, and redirects (301) to the destination. When loading for the first time, if information is empty and Slack is configured, we call Slack for the avatar URL, which has a secret location, but serves the image from outside the authentication part of their API once known. If the feature is off or no avatar url is set for the user, we simply return a `204` (no-content), preventing from logging errors or anything negative as this is expected. \r\n\r\nThe `avatar_url` field could be used programmatically in environments to serve other urls, but at this time I did not implement a GUI for users to self-set their avatar for instance. I think in most cases people will want to integrate with some external service (MSFT Team, Discord, ...). The approach I took here could be expanded to work with Gravatar for instance. \r\n\r\n#### About Perf\r\nThis approach while unconventional (is it?) should perform very well.  Say in an environment with 1000 users, the Slack API should trigger once-ish for each user in the database to fill the `avatar_url` for that user (1000 api hits). For each user navigating the website, a single hit to `/api/v1/users/{some_user_id}/avatar.png` where the database is looked up is sufficient (up to 1M hits, but super low-key endpoint), after which the permanent redirect is cached client-side. The 204 should get cached like any other request following the configured cache-control in place.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"606\" alt=\"Screenshot

`BaseEngineSpec.select_star` method provides an option (with a default) with regards to whether or not one should use a wildcard (`show_cols=False`) or enumerate the columns (`show_cols=True`) when generating a SQL statement for fetching sample records from a dataset.\r\n\r\nSome of the underlying engines—Hive, Presto, BigQuery—override this method including the default for the `show_cols` function argument. When creating the SQL statement rather than forcing `show_cols=True` we should instead fallback to the engine specific preference.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

not uncommon for users to use the `latest[_sub]_partition` Jinja macros wrongly in terms of including a leading or trailing whitespace, i.e., `latest_partition(' foo.bar ')` which actually works as this table name is extracted and injected into SQL where additional leading/trailing whitespace is allowed.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that when we extract the table name from the Jinja macro we strip any leading/trailing whitespace.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nContinuing the work on deprecating/removing server side rendered pages, this adds a new React/Antd Form and backend API for CSV uploads.\r\n\r\nmaintains all the current functionality and adds the following benefits:\r\nBackend:\r\n- better backend parameter validation.\r\n- Aligned API with `api/v1` and command pattern.\r\n- Improved error handling.\r\n\r\nFrontend:\r\n- Better looking ;)\r\n- `schemas` is a drop down related with the databases dropdown\r\n- Will initially try to infer the CSV header and load the recognised columns.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"489\" alt=\"Screenshot

header)\r\n- Columns as dates is as multi select dropdown (source from the loaded CSV header)\r\n- Column index is dropdown (source from the loaded CSV header)\r\n- Null values is a multi select dropdown pre populated\r\n- delimiter is now a dropdown\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4025227/973897d4-3214-45ae-a0ef-4bc756d54c64\r\n\r\n## Still todo on this PR:\r\n- Deprecate or remove the old view?\r\n- migrate the old view permission (depends on the previous item)\r\n- Remove the old view from the menu\r\n- After we settle on the UI add more frontend tests\r\n\r\n###

For minor and patch changes, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases\">release notes</a>.</em></p>\n<p>D3 now ships as pure ES modules and requires Node.js 12 or higher. For more, please read <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">Sindre Sorhus’s FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a> now ignores nulls. <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#ascending\">d3.ascending</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#descending\">d3.descending</a> no longer consider null comparable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/main/README.md#ordinal-scales\">Ordinal scales</a> now use <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/internmap\">InternMap</a> for domains; domain values are now uniqued by coercing to a primitive value via <em>object</em>.valueOf instead of coercing to a string via <em>object</em>.toString.</p>\n<p>Array-likes (<em>e.g.</em>, a live NodeList such as <em>element</em>.childNodes) are converted to arrays in <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selectAll\">d3.selectAll</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/main/README.md#selection_selectAll\"><em>selection</em>.selectAll</a>.</p>\n<h1>Changes in D3 6.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">Released August 26, 2020.</a></p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>uses native collections</strong> (Map and Set) and <strong>accepts iterables</strong>. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group\">d3.group and d3.rollup</a> are powerful new aggregation functions that replace d3.nest and work great <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/d/9a453665f405eebf\">with d3-hierarchy</a> and d3-selection. There are lots of new helpers in d3-array, too, such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-least\">d3.greatest</a>, <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</p>\n<p>D3 now <strong>passes events directly to listeners</strong>, replacing the d3.event global and bringing D3 inline with vanilla JavaScript and most other frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>d3-delaunay</strong> (based on Vladimir Agafonkin’s excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator\">Delaunator</a>) replaces d3-voronoi, offering dramatic improvements to performance, robustness, and <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/delaunay-find\">search</a>. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi\">d3-geo-voronoi</a> for spherical (geographical) data! <strong>d3-random</strong> is <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md\">greatly expanded</a> and includes a fast <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-randomlcg\">linear congruential generator</a> for seeded randomness. <strong>d3-chord</strong> has new layouts for <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/directed-chord-diagram\">directed</a> and transposed chord diagrams. <strong>d3-scale</strong> adds a new <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart-ii\">radial scale</a> type.</p>\n<p>… and a variety of other small enhancements. <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery\">More than 450 examples</a> have been updated to D3 6.0!</p>\n<h3>d3-array</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept iterables.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group\">d3.group</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#groups\">d3.groups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#index\">d3.index</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#indexes\">d3.indexes</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup\">d3.rollup</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollups\">d3.rollups</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#maxIndex\">d3.maxIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#minIndex\">d3.minIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatest\">d3.greatest</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#greatestIndex\">d3.greatestIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#least\">d3.least</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#leastIndex\">d3.leastIndex</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bin\">d3.bin</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#count\">d3.count</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum\">d3.cumsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#fsum\">d3.fsum</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#Adder\">d3.Adder</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantileSorted\">d3.quantileSorted</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quickselect\">d3.quickselect</a>.</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bisector_center\"><em>bisector</em>.center</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow more than two iterables for <a href=\"https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cross\">d3.cross</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
