Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates `flake8` (where we were using `flake8-import-order` and `flake8-mypy`)  in favor of using `isort` and `mypy` directly. Note `pylint` (which we use though in many cases have warnings disabled) can be viewed as a superset `flake8`.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the changes are:\r\n\r\n1. We've noticed in other repos that `flake8-mypy` has missed some issues that `mypy` discovers (fixed in this PR) and ignores some of the `mypy` settings.\r\n2. We were using `flake8` mostly for checking import order and typing now that we're using `black`. Note that `isort` both checks and formats. \r\n\r\nAlso we were using `flake8` for some other checks but simply ignoring these via `# noqa` which lacked specificity, i.e., reading the code it's not apparent what we're ignoring. Ideally we should be upping our `pylint` game as these checks would be caught by `pylint`. Currently many files have `pylint` warnings ignored and we have disabled a number of checks in the `.pylintrc` file per [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/.pylintrc#L84). In the future we enforce `pylint` for all errors and warning and enable most (if not all) checks.  \r\n\r\nThere are a few cases where I used `# type: ignore` as I ended up going down a rabbit hole when trying to resolve types. I think in the future we should try to re-enable these checks. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is part 1 for Dashboard Scoped Filter project. This PR is for a new UI module: **filter scope selector modal**. It covers the UI/UX that display/select scope (tabs and charts) for a filter field. Update dashboard redux state and persist filter scope settings to backend, will be covered in another PR.\r\n\r\nSuperset dashboard stores layout data in a tree structure. This layout structure always contains a **root** component. A root component will have a grid component (for dashboard without tabs) or a root-level tabs components as its children. In the dashboard, every UI component (tabs, row, column, and chart, etc) is a **tree node**. For example:\r\n![61979193-0da82280-afa8-11e9-9735-cd5c4435cc1e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67975697-d6ae6200-fbd1-11e9-8931-4eac27c198d6.jpg)\r\nWe can think A is root component, leaves(K,L, F, G, M, I, J) are chart components, and the rest can be container (like row, column or tabs) components.\r\n\r\nWith the growing size of the dashboard, user may want to apply one dashboard filter to some of charts in dashboard, and one filter apply to another set of charts. A very common use case is user groups similar charts in different tabs, and make a filter only applicable for this group. Currently the way to set filter's scope is not very easy to use:\r\n<img width=\"1140\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2019-10-16_at_9_49_54_AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/66944436-00785e00-f002-11e9-81c1-5b16aa6ba6ae.png\">\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced a new UI component: filter scope selector.\r\n\r\n- **left panel**: All filter_box in dashboard and their filter fields. There is also a toggle link to switch between single-edit mode or multi-edit mode.\r\n- **right panel**: show dashboard layout in the tree structure. But we hide row/column container, and group charts into its tab parent. If user have nested tabs containers, we will show all the nested tabs structure from chart to dashboard root component. We show a checkbox for each of chart and tab, user can click to select or deselect single or multiple charts. \r\n\r\nWhen user clicks the `Save` button at the bottom of the modal, we will **aggregate** the checked chart ids **into _scope_ object** and update dashboard filters state. The algorithm for this aggregation will be covered in another PR. \r\n\r\n#### Features:\r\n1. Start filter scope selector:\r\n![jwMsJ1jNea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69028924-5e44f080-0988-11ea-8954-347fb5c89240.gif)\r\n\r\n2. User can edit a single filter, or edit multiple filter fields all together. We also allow user toggle back to a single filter field in the multi-edit mode:\r\n![PtIvVuSV6s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69029436-c47e4300-0989-11ea-9368-b0bda0413b80.gif)\r\n\r\n3. Search chart name:\r\n![d2ZfBriTy2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69029719-9baa7d80-098a-11ea-9f3f-e8dbda3f53b0.gif)\r\n\r\n4. When new chart is added to dashboard, based on its layout position, it will get filters that are applicable to its tab(s):\r\n![NvggG46SWb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69032554-a7e60900-0991-11ea-8d9c-14fe0dbcd53b.gif)\r\n\r\n5. When user move charts between tabs, this may cause chart to be applicable to different filter(s). We will show a warning message when chart is moved to a different filter scope.\r\n![MVYXjUXxDr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69031530-25f4e080-098f-11ea-9051-bfd7d77be1ae.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nFilter scope selector has following UI components:\r\n- Container component: `src/dashboard/containers/FilterScope.jsx`\r\n- modal trigger: `src/dashboard/components/filterscope/FilterScopeModal.jsx`\r\n- core function UI component: `src/dashboard/components/filterscope/FilterScopeSelector.jsx`\r\n- checkbox tree component in left pane: `FilterFieldTree.jsx`\r\nrecursive traversal renderer for each filter field tree node: `renderFilterFieldTreeNodes.jsx`\r\nsimple UI component for filter filed item: `FilterFieldItem.jsx`\r\n\r\n- checkbox tree component in right pane:  `FilterScopeTree.jsx`\r\nrecursive traversal renderer for each filter scope tree node: `renderFilterScopeTreeNodes.jsx`\r\n\r\n- util functions:\r\n\r\n`getFilterFieldNodesTree`: build filter field tree from dashboard filters redux state.\r\n`getFilterScopeNodesTree`: build filter scope tree from dashboard layout.\r\n\r\n#### Tree and tree nodes\r\nWe used [a 3rd party component](https://github.com/jakezatecky/react-checkbox-tree) to render left panel filter field selector and right panel scope selector. It best matched our layout data structure, and offers very natural and convenient user experience like single selection, group selection, expand-on-click, etc. \r\n\r\nAccording to [this API](https://github.com/jakezatecky/react-checkbox-tree#properties), a`CheckboxTree` component needs following props:\r\n```\r\n// the original data to be rendered in `CheckboxTree`. The data should be in tree structure. Since js doesn't have build-in Tree data structure, we use array of node object.\r\n// for filter scope tree, it is full list of the dashboard layout (only have tabs and chart components), \r\n// for filter fields tree, it is all dashboard filter box and its fields.\r\nnodes: PropTypes.arrayOf(filterScopeSelectorTreeNodePropShape).isRequired,\r\n\r\n// when user typed keywords in search box, right pane will only show matched charts and all their parent tabs. Only used by filter scope tree component.\r\nnodesFiltered: PropTypes.arrayOf(filterScopeSelectorTreeNodePropShape).isRequired,\r\n\r\n// An array of  node values. `CheckboxTree` component will show these node as checked.\r\nchecked: PropTypes.arrayOf(\r\n    PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.number, PropTypes.string]),\r\n  ).isRequired, \r\n\r\n// An array of node values. `CheckboxTree` component will show these node as expanded tree nodes. \r\nexpanded: PropTypes.arrayOf(\r\n    PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.number, PropTypes.string]),\r\n  ).isRequired\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor filter field tree, the tree node data is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  value: filter key.\r\n  label: customized column label or column name for the chosen filter field.\r\n  children: array of children node\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nFor filter scope tree, the tree node data is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  value: chart id or tab component id\r\n  label: chart name or tab title\r\n  children: array of children node\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Local state in the filter scope selector modal\r\nFor each filter filed, we construct a unique filter key which is composed of filter_box's chart id and filter's column name: _`chartId_columnName`_\r\n\r\n`FilterScopeSelector` component uses following data to maintain the **current state in the modal:**\r\n\r\n- `showSelector`: as long as dashboard has one or more filter, we show filter scope selector UI. otherwise, show message says no filter in the dashboard.\r\n- `filterFieldNodes`: filter fields tree object.\r\n- `filterScopeMap`: a map for filter scope selections. in each entry, key is filter key, value is filter scope tree object for a filter field.\r\n- `checkedFilterFields`: array of all chosen filter key(s) in the left pane.\r\n\r\nBased on the chosen filter keys from left pane, we show the filter scope tree in the right pane, which memorize the expanded tabs and selected charts. If all charts under the tab are selected, tab will show **checked** state in its checkbox. If some of the charts under the tab are selected, tab will show **half checked** state.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the initial framework for [SIP-15](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/6360) which is currently behind a disabled feature flag. Note this is still WIP as [SIP-15A](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7656) also needs to be addressed prior to this feature being live. \r\n\r\nGiven that SIP-15 requires a rollout period (where users can preview and correct changes as necessary) the premise of this PR is to add the necessary wiring to allow users to: \r\n\r\n1. Explicitly see how the current time range endpoints behave. Note this is only when the chart references explicit times as opposed to `now`, `7 days ago`, etc.  \r\n2. Preview via link (restricted to owners) how their chart will behave when the `[start, end]` (or equivalent) interval is changed to `[start, end)`. \r\n\r\nNote the backend logic is behind a feature flag whereas the frontend logic which leverages the endpoints is not, i.e., the the `endpoints` prop is simply undefined. These endpoints will persist after SIP-15 has been rolled out (to provide more transparency as to how the time range endpoints behave though we'll simply hard code these).  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

`DISPLAY_MAX_ROW`, to limit the amount of data displayed in the UI. At Lyft, we have other clients accessing Superset programmatically, and we would like to bypass the limit when fetching data from these clients.\r\n\r\nI changed the endpoint behavior so that by default `DISPLAY_MAX_ROW` is not applied, but it can be passed optionally. The frontend was changed to query `/superset/results/${DISPLAY_MAX_ROW}`, returning only a subset of the rows.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nTested with `curl`, confirmed it works.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAnother try for #8332, which made `dbs.database_name`, `clusters.cluster_name`, and `tables.table_name` non-null to prevent `__repr__` from ever returning `None`. \r\n\r\nTweaked to also make `datasources.cluster_name` non-nullable. It has a foreign key constraint with `clusters.cluster_name` and was breaking deploys.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nRan upgrade and downgrade, confirmed that the database schema looks as expected after each action.\r\n\r\nDeployed. Confirmed does not break deploy.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSince static resources have hashed file names, we shouldn't need to even hit the webserver for them. Right now, we're hitting the server and using the etag to cache it, but this should prevent a trip to the server altogether.\r\n\r\nIt should make superset a bit more stable while deploying because these files won't be found on half the webservers while in the middle of deploying\r\n\r\nThis change also adds some flexibility to the http header configuration, allowing you to only set headers if they haven't already been set by superset. This means that we can cache static content with the `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` var, but disallow caching on everything else with `DEFAULT_HTTP_HEADERS = {\"Cache-Control\": \"no-cache\"}`.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nCI and a test deploy to see new cache control headers set\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n#8362 `CREATE TABLE AS...` needs a commit to apply, this is still a naive patch that solves the issue. The goal here is to set a discussion on how to best address this issue. Some options are:\r\n\r\n- Create a new bool attr on `Database` for autocommit, then apply on `db_engine_spec.base.execute` if true.\r\n- Find an option to set this on the connection URL (simple solution, we would just document it), needs further investigation\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a PR to our most popular viz_type at American Express. The Step/Funnel Visualization is a 2 in 1 visualization that is simple to use and highly modifiable. It has unique support of multi-pass queries and thus is worthy of the PR effort. The  'Funnel' feature can be turned on or off if the user prefers a simple step visualization over 'funnel'. \r\n\r\n###

Some users feel too many colors creates clutter and distraction on dashboards. \r\n\r\nSo we proposed a little simplified UI:\r\n\r\n- If dashboard has less than 4 filter fields, show colored indicator for each of filter field.\r\n- if dashboard has 4 or more filter fields, only show 1 grouped (black colored) filter indicator.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n<img width=\"848\" alt=\"Screen Shot

This method of skipping lint checks will hide all pylint failures introduced into the files. This PR removes those lines, fixes a number of pylint errors, and uses a more targeted disable approach for issues that would require larger refactors to resolve. Using this approach for disabling lint should highlight new problems introduced in future PRs and creates a specific list of items to clean up down the road.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIf a user somehow creates a table with a null name, 503 errors occur whenever `repr(table)` is called because `__repr__` returns a non-string type.\r\n\r\nFixed schema to make columns referenced by `__repr__` non-nullable.\r\n\r\nBefore running the migration, you must manually fix any records with null `clusters.cluster_name`, `dbs.database_name`, or `tables.table_name`. To find problematic records, run a query like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    *\r\nFROM \r\n   tables\r\nWHERE \r\n   table_name IS NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nConfirmed that after upgrade, I get a warning if I try to insert a row with a null `table_name`.\r\n\r\nConfirmed that after downgrade, I am able to insert a row with a null `table_name` with no problem.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd improved type casting for BigQuery, similar to what https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8226 did for Presto. This prevents 64 bit integers from being converted to floats by Pandas, losing precision.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI verified that int64 values are not cast to float, and that precision is maintained. I also tested that all types are cast correctly:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  'string' AS `string`,\r\n  CAST('string' AS BYTES) AS `bytes`,\r\n  100 AS `integer`,\r\n  100.0 AS `float`,\r\n  CAST(1 AS NUMERIC) AS `numeric`,\r\n  CAST(1 AS BOOLEAN) AS `boolean`,\r\n  STRUCT(1) AS `record`,\r\n  TIMESTAMP(DATETIME \"2008-12-25 15:30:00\", \"America/Los_Angeles\") AS `timestamp`,\r\n  DATE \"2008-12-25\" AS `date`,\r\n  TIME \"15:30:00\" AS `time`,\r\n  DATETIME \"2008-12-25 15:30:00\" AS `datetime`\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated CSV:\r\n\r\n| string | bytes | integer | float | numeric | boolean | record | timestamp | date | time | datetime |\r\n| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\r\n| string | b'string' | 100 | 100.0 | 1.0 | True | \"{\"\"_field_1\"\": 1}\" | 2008-12-25 23:30:00+00:00 | 2008-12-25 | 15:30:00 | 2008-12-25 15:30:00 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new

Should prevent these fields from being null in the future, but this might require a db migration.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen saving a query in SQLLab, currently there is no good way to update a query you were previously working on. You have to save a new one, then go to the saved queries list and delete the old one. This change lets you choose to overwrite the previous entry or save a new copy.\r\n\r\nA speed bump I ran into was that the frontend is using several field names that are different from the names the backend uses. My first instinct was to change that so that a field means the same thing everywhere, but that gets pretty complicated pretty fast, due to the way the redux state is being persisted locally - how does the Superset frontend do migrations? #7748 will probably allow solving this problem.\r\n\r\nSo instead I grouped the existing differences (plus my addition of a `remoteId` field) into a `queryClientMapping` object, with the goal of isolating the differences to one layer of the system - where the client actually makes API calls. That way UI components like `SaveQuery` don't have to concern themselves with those differences. This hasn't been propagated to all parts of the code that use saved queries, yet.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"318\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-25 at 7 04 01 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/65652654-5049a380-dfc7-11e9-84eb-3e7d29f5fb59.png\">\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"321\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-09-25 at 7 03 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/65652658-53449400-dfc7-11e9-9a1a-86bc90452af0.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI've already tested it pretty well, I think. This is my first contribution to Superset so it's entirely possible that I missed something. It would be nice to get some additional verification that nothing I've done will mess up anyone's local state.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis pull request changes the way negative time delta's are displayed. The default python display of a negative timedelta is rather unintuitive for a user of a dashboard. For example, -6 minutes is displayed as `'-1 day, 23:54:00`. This basically requires users to make time calculations in their heads to interpret the number correctly. This pull request changes the formatting to  '-0:06:00' at the code level and `-0 days 00:06:00` at the superset UI level to make it easier for users to interpret the time delta. More details on the issue and why this solution was chosen can be found in #8274 .\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe data in postgres looks like this:\r\n![data_in_postgres](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4882376/65375052-6686f500-dc91-11e9-97b8-097f64ae594c.png)\r\n\r\nBefore this pull request the data looks like this in superset:\r\n![data_in_superset_table_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4882376/65375140-6d623780-dc92-11e9-8165-661eb0fd9ea2.png)\r\n\r\nAfterwards it looks like this in superset:\r\n![data_in_superset_table_after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4882376/65375109-05135600-dc92-11e9-9e9d-30a195465be9.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- The unit test for base_json_conv() has been enhanced to handle timedelta's as well\r\n- A new function has been added in superset.utils.core named `timedelta_f` which is called in base_json_conv() (same module). A new test has been added to test this formatting function.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

value of the aggregators. This leads to absurd values showing up in the time series line or bar charts such as -9223372036854775808 (which is Long.MIN_VALUE in Java) if you do a MAX aggregation on Long metric and 9223372036854775807 if you do a MIN aggregation on Long metric. SUM aggregation returns a default of 0.0 \r\nSuch large values completely distort the chart.","created_at":"2019-09-20T18:16:31Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:40:10Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T00:46:35Z","merged_at":"2019-09-25T00:46:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a8f3eb43ff068a8612338015f605f1951ce57b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1497453504,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk3NDUzNTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v0.34","name":"v0.34","color":"dddddd","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nPresto queries that return no data are raising the exception \"too many indices for array\". This happens because the Numpy array that wraps the data has shape `(0,)`, and when we create the Pandas time series for the dataframe we try to access each column using index `[:,i]`.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by reshaping the array to 2D, even if empty. Query now succeeds with \"The query returned no data\".\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI tested the failing query, and also added a unit test. I also added a unit test for https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8253.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe've been trying to track down database row locking issues when trying to call the `stop_query` endpoint for several months now. After digging into this file, it seems like the session that we create to run sql queries has autoflush enabled. Therefore, we're locking the db on these rows until committing the changes to the query. We don't commit this until after the query finishes, so the row gets locked and we can't set the query to stopped. By committing before running the query, this seems to have resolved the issue for us.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + Deployed in our production environment\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7084 this PR strips leading and trailing whitespace (produced when using the forms) from specific non-NULL string columns. Previously #7084 dealt only with the cases where the values contained _only_ whitespace. \r\n\r\nWe ran into this issue when trying to debug a security issue were the table names weren't matching due to trailing whitespace. It seems prudent that the records in Superset's schema be trustworthy and it's more desirable to clean this up via a migration than having to call `.strip()` every time we dealing with records from the database. \r\n \r\nNote depending on the state of the database stripping whitespace may lead to duplicate names which could violate uniqueness constraints and cause the migration to fail. Manually intervention may be required. For example the following MySQL query illustrates SQL metrics which are duplicates after spaces (including tabs) are removed: \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    table_id, \r\n    TRIM(TRIM(BOTH '\\t' FROM metric_name)) AS metric_name,\r\n    COUNT(1) AS cnt\r\nFROM \r\n    sql_metrics \r\nGROUP BY \r\n    table_id,\r\n    TRIM(TRIM(BOTH '\\t' FROM metric_name))\r\nHAVING \r\n    cnt > 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nRan `superset db upgrade` (and `superset db downgrade`) and verified that the leading and trailing whitespaces were removed. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n* `deck.gl` plugins are migrated to new repo [superset-ui-plugins-deckgl](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins-deckgl) and published as `npm` package `@superset-ui/legacy-preset-deckgl`.\r\n\r\n> Note: These `deck.gl` plugins were not added to `superset-ui-plugins` as the CI of that repo is hitting perf limit already and they seem different from the other enough.\r\n> Note 2: The new repo could be a home for kepler plugin as well.\r\n\r\n* In the new repo, I have migrated the code, fix all dependencies, make them independent, lint all the code as much as I could, and add storybook for every single one of them.\r\n\r\nSee Storybook: https://apache-superset.github.io/superset-ui-plugins-deckgl\r\n\r\n* Old code under the `visualizations` folder are therefore deleted from this repo as well as dependencies that are no longer needed are removed from `package.json`.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nRan locally and verify that all deck.gl charts in the example look the same\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSomewhat of a yak-shaving PR as the intent was to fix an issue where Hive queries failed in SQL Lab if no schema was selected, \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 3 54 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/65192859-933ad280-da2d-11e9-9094-45f487dbd7f3.png)\r\n\r\nThe error is coming from [here](https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/blob/master/pyhive/hive.py#L205) in PyHive where it seems that the schema (database) is being defined via the `\"null\"` string as opposed to `None`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this is in the front-end the `SupersetClient` has passing the data as form data (using the `multipart/form-data` Content-Type header) which was then being processed in Flask via [`response.form`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.Request.form). This meant everything was being encoded as strings, i.e., hence why we had logic like,\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequest.form.get(\"runAsync\") == \"true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand why `null` was being encoded as `\"null\"` as opposed to `None`. The fix was to:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the front-end correctly encodes the body as JSON (and sets the appropriate headers).\r\n2. Use [`response.json`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.Request.json) to correctly process the response.\r\n3. Remove the obsolete `GET` method to `sql_json`. \r\n4. For testing use the somewhat misnamed `json` argument to Flask's test `client.post(...)` method which is actually a Python dictionary (ironically the `data` argument can be a JSON string) and removes the need to specify the Content-Type header (which is needed for `response.json` otherwise we would need to use `response.get_json(force=True)` which seems a little heavy handed). \r\n  \r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

not working for some types. We have a query returning the following error:\r\n\r\n> <U10 cannot be converted to an IntegerDtype\r\n\r\nThis happens because before creating the Pandas dataframe we cast the data into a Numpy array, and Numpy is casting all columns to the same type. I fixed it by keeping the dtype as \"object\".\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, Presto displays views as tables, since the statement `SHOW TABLES` shows both views and tables, and there's no `SHOW VIEWS`.\r\n\r\nOne workaround to get the list of views is to query the `information_schema` schema:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema_views WHERE table_schema='default';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns the actual list of views, but it's slow. On our Presto cluster it takes approximately 90 seconds to get all the views across all schemas. Fortunately, the API that exposes the views is cached, so this shouldn't be too bad.\r\n\r\nI added a new feature flag, `PRESTO_SPLIT_VIEWS_FROM_TABLES` (open for better name suggestions), that when enabled will show views differently than tables in SQL Lab.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNow views are properly marked as such in

SUMMARY\r\nImproves database connection form validation (and API data submission). Currently a user would only know about URI parse validation errors after form submission, with this change an error is shown to the user while still editing the form.

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the logic of the `expand_data` method in Presto, while making it more generic. Queries that were failing before, like\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ARRAY[ROW(100,0,'hello')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nare now working.\r\n\r\nSome of the methods in `db_engine_specs/presto.py` are no longer used and can be removed; I'll do that in a subsequent PR. I wanted to keep this PR simple and small because it's blocking an important release.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI updated the unit tests, and tested with real data. I'll add more unit tests in the next PR, covering more complex cases.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

-->\r\n\r\nWhen a column has `int64` integers and missing data, Pandas will cast it to `float64`, resulting in loss of precision and possibly returning incorrect numbers.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by adding a method to the DB engine specs that returns a `dtype` based on the cursor description, currently implemented in Presto only. With the `dtype`, we can create a Pandas `Series` for each column, and create a `DataFrame` that has the proper types.\r\n\r\nNote that in order to represent the column correctly we need to use a [nullable data type](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/integer_na.html), introduced in Pandas 0.240. Unfortunately, [PyArrow is unable to serialize the resulting data frame](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4168), so `msgpack` has to be disabled.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPart of the ongoing saga of trying to fix `stop_query` issues.\r\n\r\nFlips the order of the rejected tables check and query creation so that queries are created slightly earlier. This might prevent errors like `No row was found for one()` if a user stops the query before it is actually created. \r\n\r\nThis also means that if a user doesn't have access to the tables in the query, the query will still be recorded in the queries table with the status `QueryStatus.FAILED`. Previously, these queries were not recorded.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nRan some queries locally to make sure they still worked. Confirmed that queries are now logged to the queries table with the status QueryStatus.FAILED if the user does not have access to a table in the query.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is the beginning of work to move controls from `controls.jsx` (> 2,000 lines of code) into per-viztype control panels. The goal is to prepare control panel configs for separation into plugins. \r\n\r\nNote: Depends on #8221 \r\n\r\n#### Migration instructions \r\n* The controls that are used only once or twice should be moved immediately, e.g. `rotation`, `show_bubbles`. (See attached table below.) This would cut the size of `controls.jsx` more than half already.\r\n* We could leave the controls that are commonly used in `controls.jsx` for the first pass.\r\n* If there are `controlOverrides` in the control panel config, manually override the control config and remove the override config from `controlOverrides` (see `size_from` and `size_to`).\r\n* Try to avoid import as the control panel config file should be quite standalone\r\n* Not sure what to do with validators yet. Ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\n#### Control usage statistics\r\n\r\nControl name | No. of charts using it\r\n-------------| ----\r\nadhoc_filters| 45\r\nrow_limit| 33\r\ngroupby| 21\r\ncolor_scheme|

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n### CONTEXT\r\n\r\nPreviously, control panels are defined as list of control names (which is mapped to control config objects listed in `controls.jsx` during runtime), e.g.:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontrolSetRows = [['significance_level', 'pvalue_precision', 'liftvalue_precision']]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecently, we introduce support for inline control configuration (to decentralize these configs from the gigantic `controls.jsx`).\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncontrolSetRows = [\r\n  [{\r\n    name: 'significance_level',\r\n    config: {\r\n      type: 'TextControl',\r\n      label: t('Significance Level'),\r\n      default: 0.05,\r\n      description: t('Threshold alpha level for determining significance'),\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n    'pvalue_precision', 'liftvalue_precision']]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe initial state was initialized incorrectly when using control config object instead of control name.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n* Refactor `getControlState` into `getControlState` and `getControlStateFromControlConfig`\r\n* Use `getControlStateFromControlConfig` in line `172` instead of simply cloning
