For use-cases involving mostly append_only requirements (event logs), users don't have much necessity to do any updates as such. And if such users don't really require incremental queries, we can disable all meta columns with hudi table. And this patch adds such support to bulk_insert operation. \r\n- Other operations such as update, delete, compaction, clustering etc will be added in future patches. This patch adds support only for bulk_insert. But still queryable though. \r\n- All built in key generators are supported in this flow (bulk insert). \r\n- Few constraints in this flow (disabling meta columns with bulk_insert):\r\n  - No Sort Modes are supported. \r\n  - No incremental support. \r\n\r\nNew config introduced: \"hoodie.populate.meta.columns\" whose default value is true. \r\nThis config value will be serialized to hoodie.properties. Once disabled, it can never be enabled back for a given hudi table. But if users have an existing hudi table, this config can be disabled after they upgrade w/o needing any extra upgrade steps. \r\n- Added a new api to BuiltInKeyGenerator to fetch partition path from InternalRow. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nI am yet to add some more tests for some of the changes in this patch. But have verified locally via spark shell for non partitioned, partitioned w/ simple and complex key gen. Wanted to open up for reviews as I add more tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWe want to run all unit tests with ORC as the base file format. But currently, some unit tests are hardcoded to use Parquet as the base file format. So we need to update the unit tests to supoort ORC format.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update `HoodieWriteableTestTable` to support writing to ORC base files.\r\n- Update `HoodieReadClient` to support reading from ORC files.\r\n- Update `HoodieClientTestUtils` to support reading from ORC files.\r\n- Update `DFSHoodieDatasetInputReader` and `SparkBasedReader` to support reading from ORC files.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new marker file strategy that optimizes the marker-related latency for file systems with non-trivial file I/O latency, such as Amazon S3.  The existing marker file mechanism creates one marker file per data file written.  When listing and deleting the marker files, S3 throttles the I/O operations if the number of marker files is huge and it can take 10 minutes for listing alone.  When write concurrency is high, the marker creation can also be throttled by S3.  Such behavior degrades the performance of the write.  The new timeline-server-based marker file strategy delegates the marker creation and other marker-related operations from individual executors to the timeline server. The timeline server maintains the markers and consistency by periodically flushing the in-memory markers to a limited number of underlying files in the file system.  In such a way, the number of actual file operations and latency related to markers can be reduced, thus improving the performance of the writes.\r\n\r\nTo improve the efficiency of processing marker creation requests, we design the batch processing in the handler of marker requests at the timeline server.  Each marker creation request is handled asynchronously in the Javalin timeline server and queued before processing.  For every batch interval, e.g., 20ms, a dispatching thread pulls the pending requests from the queue and sends them to the worker thread for processing.  Each worker thread processes the marker creation requests, sets the responses, and flushes the new markers by overwriting the underlying file storing the markers in the file system.  There can be multiple worker threads running concurrently, given that the file overwriting takes longer than the batch interval, and each worker thread writes to an exclusive file not touched by other threads, to guarantee consistency and correctness.  Both the batch interval and the number of worker threads can be configured through the write options.\r\n\r\nNote that the worker thread always checks whether the marker has already been created by comparing the marker name from the request with the memory copy of all markers maintained in the marker directory state class.  The underlying files storing the markers are only read upon the first marker request (lazy loading).  The responses of requests are only sent back once the new markers are flushed to the files, so that in the case of timeline server failure, the timeline server can recover the already created markers.   These ensure consistency between the file system and the in-memory copy, and improve the performance of processing marker requests.\r\n\r\nSince the new timeline-server-based marker mechanism is intended for cloud storage, it is not supported for HDFS at this point (an exception is thrown if timeline-server-based marker mechanism is configured for writes on HDFS).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- New marker-related write options in `HoodieWriteConfig`\r\n  - `hoodie.write.markers.type`: marker type to use for the writes.  Two modes are supported: `direct` and `timeline_server_based`.\r\n  - `hoodie.markers.timeline_server_based.batch.num_threads`: number of threads to use for batch processing marker creation requests at the timeline server for timeline-server-based marker strategy\r\n  - `hoodie.markers.timeline_server_based.batch.interval_ms`: the batch interval in milliseconds for marker creation batch processing for timeline-server-based marker strategy\r\n- Abstraction of marker mechanism (`WriteMarkers` class)\r\n  - Provides an interface for marker file strategy, containing different operations (create marker, delete marker directory, get all markers, etc.)\r\n  - Creates an enum, `MarkerType`, to indicate the marker type used for the current write\r\n  - Creates a new class, `DirectWriteMarkers`, for the existing mechanism which directly creates a marker file per data file in the file system from each executor\r\n  - Creates a factory class, `WriteMarkersFactory`, to generate `WriteMarkers` instance based on the marker type.   Throws `HoodieException` if `timeline_server_based` is used for HDFS since the support for HDFS is not ready.\r\n  - Uses `WriteMarkersFactory` at all places where markers are needed (write handles, Java, Spark, Flink engines)\r\n- New timeline-server-based marker file implementation\r\n  - Creates a new class, `TimelineServerBasedWriteMarkers`, for the timeline-server-based marker file strategy, which sends requests to the timeline server for all marker-related operations\r\n- Handling marker requests at the timeline server\r\n  - Adds a class to store request URLs and parameters in `MarkerOperation`\r\n  - Creates `MarkerDirState` class to store the state of a marker directory and operate on the markers inside the directory\r\n  - Adds a future class, `MarkerCreationFuture`, to be able to process marker creation requests asynchronously\r\n  - Creates a request handler, `MarkerHandler`, for marker-related requests, which schedules the dispatching thread at a fixed rate based on the batching interval upon the first marker creation request\r\n  - Creates a `MarkerCreationDispatchingRunnable` for scheduling periodic, batched processing of marker creation requests\r\n  - Creates a `BatchedMarkerCreationRunnable` for batch processing marker creation requests\r\n  - Adds a context class, `BatchedMarkerCreationContext`, for passing the pending requests from the dispatching thread to the worker threads\r\n- New units around timeline-server-based marker file strategy\r\n- Code cleanup\r\n  - Refactoring the configuration of `EmbeddedTimelineService`, `TimelineService` and `RequestHandler`\r\n\r\nFollow-up TODOs are summarized in this ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HUDI/issues/HUDI-2271\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis direct marker file strategy is covered by existing tests in `TestDirectWriteMarkers`.  This change adds unit tests in `TestTimelineServerBasedWriteMarkers` to verify the new timeline-server-based marker file strategy.\r\n\r\nWe have also manually verified the change by running multiple Spark jobs on large datasets in the cluster with different file system settings:\r\n- Hadoop/Yarn cluster with HDFS testing succeeds with both marker file strategies for 30GB input data (1000 parquet files, 400M records) producing 43k data files (**Note that this is done by explicitly commenting out the exception throwing in the `WriteMarkersFactory` so the new timeline-server-based markers can be used on HDFS.  By default, the job should throw an exception in this setup, which is also tested below.  We plan to enhance the support of timeline-server-based markers for HDFS in follow-ups.**)\r\n  - `direct`: 19.6 mins (1175943 ms)\r\n  - `timeline-server-based`: 19.7 mins (1179346 ms)\r\n- Amazon EMR with S3 testing succeeds with both marker file strategies for 100GB input data producing 165k data files, thanks to @nsivabalan 's help\r\n  - `direct`: 55 mins\r\n  - `timeline-server-based`: 38 mins\r\n- Testing of retried stages in Spark succeeded with expected cleanup of invalid data files and correct number of records in the table\r\n  - Enables spark speculative execution in the spark shell with the following config so that the Spark automatically kills the tasks beyond a certain task duration and retries with new attempts, emulating the failed stages intentionally\r\n    - `spark.speculation=true`\r\n    - `spark.speculation.multiplier=1.0`\r\n    - `spark.speculation.quantile=0.5`\r\n  - Runs the same job with timeline-server-based marker file strategy\r\n  - Driver logs show that there are quite some tasks killed and retried: `WARN scheduler.TaskSetManager: Lost task 1537.1 in stage 22.0 (TID 17375, executor 290): TaskKilled (another attempt succeeded)`\r\n  - Executor logs show that invalid data files are indeed deleted at the end\r\n    - Stage: `Delete invalid files generated during the write operation`, `collect at HoodieSparkEngineContext.java:73`\r\n    - Log: `21/08/06 19:39:01 INFO table.HoodieTable: Deleting invalid data files=[(/tmp/temp_marker_test_table/asia/india/chennai,/tmp/temp_marker_test_table/asia/india/chennai/5dcae584-1563-4f13-9ce4-955864a2b616-38_162-12-2694_20210806192244.parquet),...`\r\n  - Verifies that the number of records written to the table is the same as the input\r\n    - `val df2 = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/temp_marker_test_table/*/*/*/*.parquet\")`\r\n    - `df2.select(\"_hoodie_record_key\").distinct.count` outputs the same count (400M) as the input df\r\n- Testing of configuring timeline-server-based markers on HDFS and it throws `HoodieException`, which is expected:\r\n  - `Caused by: org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieException: Timeline-server-based markers are not supported for HDFS: base path /tmp/temp_marker_test_table`\r\n\r\nMore details

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently we process all the update-action and inert-action in the ExpressionPayload#\r\n\r\ngetInsertValue without know whether the record is matched or not matched for MOR table. This may result in incorrect merge result. e.g.\r\n\r\n> Merge into h0\r\n> using (select 2 as id, 'a1' as name, 10 as price from s) s0\r\n> on h0.id = s0.id\r\n> when matched then s0.id = 1 the update set id = s0.id, name = s0.name, price = 10\r\n> when not matched then s0.id = 2 the insert (id,name,price) values(id,name, 20)\r\n\r\nIf the id = 2 can matched the target table h0,  but it cannot match the udpate-condition ( s0.id = 1),  It should not update the table. However, currently we cannot know the matched state of the input record, it will goes to the not-matched actions and update the price to 20 finally. This is incorrect.\r\nSo we need to know the update flag of the record and process the matched-action if it is update record, else process the not-matched action. Currently we've mixed the two actions together which result the bug.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Pass the update flag to the `ExpressionPlay#getInsertValue` from `HoodieAppendHandle`.\r\n- `ExpressionPlay#getInsertValue` call  `processMatchedRecord` or `processNotMatchedRecord` according to the update flag to distinguish the matched-action and not-matched action for MOR table.\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nContribute a Grafana Dashboard for HUDI.\r\n\r\n## Brief description\r\n\r\nThe Dashboard assumes  that the stats are published with the following format:\r\n    stats.$dc.gauges.hoodie.$Environment.$Tablefilter\r\n    stats.$dc.gauges.hoodie.$Environment.$Dataset.$Tablefilter\r\n\r\nwhere: dc=datacenter\r\n             Environment=dev, production, staging, etc\r\n             TableFilter=Name of the HUDI Table\r\n             Dataset=A collection for tables (e.g. by team or by functionality or usage)\r\n\r\nThe stat queries use both M3QL syntax or graphite query syntax (small number). In future, we will standardize on M3QL as it has proven to be move scalable, performant and faster in our use case with millions of metrics emitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTips to use the Dashboard:\r\n1. Import the dashboard and modify the following as per your metric publishing system\r\n    1. Check that the M3QL tags are accurate\r\n    2. Check the graphite stats name prefixes are correct\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis is not a code but a json file containing a Grafana Dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

the rolled-back instant was synced to the Metadata Table, a corresponding deltacommit with the same timestamp should have been created on the Metadata Table timeline. To ensure we can always perform this check, the Metadata Table instants should not be archived until their corresponding instants are present in the dataset timeline. But this requires a large number of instants to be kept on the metadata table.\r\n\r\nIn this change, the metadata table will keep atleast the number of instants that the main dataset is keeping. If the instant being rolled back was before the metadata table timeline, the code will throw an exception and the metadata table will have to be re-bootstrapped. This should be a very rare occurrence and should occur only when the dataset is being repaired by rolling back multiple commits or restoring to a much older time.\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. Check that the instant-being-rolled-back was commited to metadata table\r\n2.

Value\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix the bug that spark query MOR tble written By flink teturn incorrect timestamp value.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Currently we convert  the  `tableAvroSchema` to `requiredStructSchema` first,  then convert it to `requiredAvroSchema` using `SchemaConverters.toAvroType`. In such process , the mill-second Timestamp avro type written by flink (Timestamp(3)) will convert to spark sql's Timestamp type first, then the `SchemaConverters.toAvroType` convert the sql's Timestamp type to micro-second Timestamp avro type finally. `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD` will use micro-second Timestamp to parse the mill-second timestamp value which result in incorrect value like '1970-xx-xx xx:xx:xx' .\r\n- In order to solve this problem, I get the `requiredAvroSchema` for the `tableAvroSchema` directly which can keep the origin timestamp type. And then convert the `requiredAvroSchema` to `requiredStructSchema`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - Add TestMergeOnReadSnapshotRelation\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Committer

PR for #3117 \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the ExternalSpillableMap. Our benchmark results shows that RockDb may improve performance significantly when the data set is large while available memory may be scarce. RockDb supports compression, efficient memory usage and native library, that may be more efficient in certain situations. By default, disk based map will be used, and a config change will be required to enable rocksDb.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the rocksDB support is only enabled for HoodieMergeHandle, and a subsequent PR will extend it to all consumers of ExternalSpillableMap (tracked here HUDI-2044)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2073\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nUsers can launch HoodieClusteringJob through sparkSubmit to \r\n\r\n1. Scheduling clustering\r\n2. Execute clustering\r\n\r\nBut these spark jobs will never finished and SparkSubmit never quit even jobs are finished or failed.\r\n\r\nThis is because clustering job will init a SparkRDDWriteClient to doSchedule or do cluster But did not close this client after that. It will cause that `jsc.stop();` can't kill this sparkJob and hang forever.\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to fix this bug.\r\n## Brief change log\r\nadd a try(client) {xxxx} to make sure that this client will be closed no matter this job is successful or failed after used.\r\nAlso this pr is tested on my local env and works fine.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds async clustering support for HoodieDeltaStreamer and Spark streaming writes to Hudi table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Async clustering is configurable.\r\n  - Reuses the existing clustering methods in write client and timeline.\r\n  - Hence, it has the same limitations that exist with current clustering strategy i.e. updates are rejected.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added unit tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` and `TestStructuredStreaming`.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running a job locally.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella
