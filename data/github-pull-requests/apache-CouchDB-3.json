if the coordinator process is killed too quickly, before the stream worker cleanup process is spawned, remote workers may be left around waiting until the default 5 minute timeout expires.\r\n\r\nIn order to reliably clean up processes in that state, need to start the cleaner process, with all the job references, before we start submitting them for execution.\r\n\r\nAt first, it may seem impossible to monitor a process until after it's already spawned. That's true for regular processes, however rexi operates on plain references. For each process we spawn remotely we create a reference on the coordinator side, which we can then use to track that job. Those are just plain manually created references. Nothing stops us from creating them first, adding them to a cleaner process, and only then submitting them.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what this commit accomplishes:\r\n\r\n  * Create a streams specific `fabric_streams:submit_jobs/4` function, which spawns the cleanup process early, generates worker references, and then submits the jobs. This way, all the existing streaming submit_jobs can be replaced easily in one line: fabric_util -> fabric_streams.\r\n\r\n  * The cleanup process operates as previously: monitors the coordinator for exits, and fires off `kill_all` message to each node.\r\n\r\n  * Create `rexi:cast_ref(...)` variants of `rexi:cast(...)` calls, where the caller specifies the references as arguments. This is what allows us to start the cleanup process before the jobs are even submitted. Older calls can just be transformed to call into the `cast_ref` versions with their own created references.\r\n\r\nNoticed that we don't need to keep the whole list of shards in memory in the cleaner process. For Q=64, N=3 that can add up to a decent blob of binary paths. We only need node names (atoms) and refs. So updated to use just a set of [{Node, Ref}, ...]. A set since in theory someone would add the same worker twice to it.\r\n\r\nSince we added the new `rexi:cast_ref(...)` variants, ensure to add more test coverage, including the streaming logic as well. It's not 100% yet, but getting there.\r\n\r\nAlso, the comments in `rexi.erl` were full of erldoc stanzas and we don't actually build erldocs anywhere, so replace them with something more helpful. The streaming protocol itself was never quite described anywhere, and it can take sometime to figure it out (at least it took me), so took the chance to also add a very basic, high level description of the message flow.\r\n\r\nRelated:

external calls are fairly simple: it's when we use the function in the module via the external reference. Previously, with hotcode upgrades that might have made sense, but currently it doesn't, maybe even adds a tiny bit of overhead on each call. A couple of these were cleaned up in chttpd module.\r\n\r\nUnused externals are functions which are exported but not used anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we didn't even use the function at all, like in the case of `stream_init/1,2` or `rexi:stream/1,2,3` we can remove their bodies as well.\r\n\r\nSince `stream_init` is removed, update the `init_stream` as per https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/5122, where we noticed that the newer `init_stream` doesn't actually update the timeout metric, so before cleaning up `stream_init` move that to the `init_stream`.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-18T21:34:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T22:17:52Z","closed_at":"2024-07-18T22:13:28Z","merged_at":"2024-07-18T22:13:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"db76ed36164a20435abfd933f20118833cd5cb25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/ca9913b8ad6f5b8e0af47e2dfcb7aae6e7b265a7","head":{"label":"apache:unused-externals-and-local-externals","ref":"unused-externals-and-local-externals","sha":"ca9913b8ad6f5b8e0af47e2dfcb7aae6e7b265a7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

we've seen in issue #5130, and demonstrated experimentally on a test node, a node in distributed mode can return `nonode@nohost` for the `node()` call. Our code, especially in `upgrade_epochs/1`, expects that `node()` will always return the configured distributed node name when in distributed mode.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements the `node_name/0` function that works like `node()` but will always return the distributed node name from when the system first starts up. The name value is saved in a persistent term and then it can accessed throughout the life of the node, even during the shutdown phase, when the dist controller may have exited already.\r\n\r\nPersistent term usage should avoid this being a bottleneck. It turns out it's even a bit faster than calling the native `node()` function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> timer:tc(fun() -> [config:node_name() || _ <- lists:seq(1, 1000000)], ok end).\r\n{628895,ok}\r\n\r\n% dummy tc call to check for overhead\r\n> timer:tc(fun() -> [ok || _ <- lists:seq(1, 1000000)], ok end).\r\n{325742,ok}\r\n\r\n% overhead over a dummy tc call\r\n> 628895-325742.\r\n303153\r\n\r\n% 0.3 microseconds\r\n> 303153/1000000.\r\n0.303153\r\n\r\n% compare to `node()`\r\n> timer:tc(fun() -> [node() || _ <- lists:seq(1, 1000000)], ok end).\r\n{480578,ok}\r\n```\r\nIn addition to a persistent node name, add a few a assertions in the earliest startup code in config:init/1 to check that the configured node name and the result of `node()` stop the VM if user specified a name but we still ended up with a standalone mode anyway.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-16T06:17:29Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T22:46:37Z","closed_at":"2024-07-16T22:33:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f9afcd60d1edd546af2e6fd85988a4ca7adc2a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/edf504ad3d91ce95411a0b6ab8235e63798bee80","head":{"label":"apache:persistent-node-names","ref":"persistent-node-names","sha":"edf504ad3d91ce95411a0b6ab8235e63798bee80","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

few QuickJS Improvements\r\n\r\n1. Make QuickJS memory limits match Spidermonkey\r\n\r\nSpidermonkey only sets the stack limit size, so do the same for QuickJS.\r\n\r\nThis changes how the oom test behaves and since already have two oom tests remove the flaky one.\r\n\r\n2. Make QuickJS dispatch respond with an error instead of throwing a null\r\n\r\nFor some internal errors, especially when bumping into memory limits, a null exception is thrown, instead of re-throwing try to behave like the SM loop.js and other error handling by returning an error line and then indicating we shouldn't continue. This way process crashes will be reserved for segfaults and such.\r\n\r\n3. Improve QuickJS scanner plugin\r\n\r\n * Be more resilient to errors, so we log the errors but do not get stuck forever retrying to rescan the same db/ddoc/doc.\r\n\r\n * Reduce the memory and doc batch size limits. Previous size and memory limit were taken from the mrview index settings, but we're also dealing with VDUs, filters, and other things, so to keep the engines from crashing or consuming too many resources opt to reduce the limits a bit at the expense of possibly running longer.\r\n\r\n * Previously, if a view check crashed the JS process, and it died, then any filter or VDU checks for the same DB will fail because the new JS processes won't have the \"taught\" design documents. To fix this, if we notice the SM or QJS process is dead, we respawn it, and then also load all the design docs.\r\n\r\n * Since we're not building an actual view btree, don't set a reduce limit. We send potentially a lot more data to the reduce functions, and we'd have a higher chance of triggering the reduce limit exception. So then we just end up showing a discrepancy in stack traces and reduce limit error format, instead of validating the actual output of the reduce functions.\r\n\r\n * Since QuickJS is the new engine, and is mostly likely to show issues or crashes, always try to use the Spidermonkey process first instead of the QuickJS one. Otherwise if SM crashes we may not get a good signal if there is some discrepancy between engines, or just a bad JS code in general that throws errors anyway.\r\n\r\n * Add a few more tests for some large reduce values and some odd formatting around functions.","created_at":"2024-06-22T01:09:54Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T20:42:34Z","closed_at":"2024-06-22T05:13:24Z","merged_at":"2024-06-22T05:13:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1fc2f0121f46f9d429297af5dabb93b31a65d6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/e617002a9885e0bc5a3daf4bd866f56edc3692f7","head":{"label":"apache:quickjs-fixes","ref":"quickjs-fixes","sha":"e617002a9885e0bc5a3daf4bd866f56edc3692f7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

it with a simpler logging based scheme.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `couch_io_logger` would log to a directory provided via an environment variable. However since it was introduced, we hadn't used it that much. Debugging a few recent couchjs issue it was useful just to be able to log the commands, so simplified the IO logging to just dump commands to the logs.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to filter out just \"OS Process\" log lines, make the log line a bit more uniform so they have the general form \"OS Process ~p $type :: $extra...\". Staying with an environment variable pattern, made that pass in a log level.\r\n\r\nSo it's possible to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake && COUCHDB_IO_LOG_LEVEL=warning make eunit apps=couch_quickjs\r\nsuites=couch_quickjs_scanner_plugin_tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then logs would show:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[warning] 2024-06-21T04:33:57.825302Z nonode@nohost <0.2204.0> -------- OS Process

we didn't account for all the possible migration patterns, specifically, when a replication job would migrate from node A to node C, when we move a shard from A to B. The job would stop on node A, on node B the replicator would notice it's not the owner, and ignore the change. Node C, however, would never experience any shard file changes, so it would never know it should start the replication job.\r\n\r\nTo fix the migration logic, pick a naive approach and make the replication doc processor retain the replication records not just for the jobs it owns, but also for the shard copies for which it could be a potential owner. Then, periodically, check ownership, and start/stop jobs accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe difference from before is now we have a new replicator doc processor state: `not_owner`. Docs in this state still track all the doc updates, but otherwise stay inactive: they don't run jobs and they don't update replication documents on errors. Only if the node becomes the owner, it switches the record to `initializing` state and the job starts to run.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary duplicate job dueling, while other nodes still haven't run their membership checks, the usurped jobs are stopped immediately during a membership check, but those that should run are started with a delay. That means that jobs which migrates, may stop running for a minute or so, and then should start running on another node.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, can remove couch_replicator_db_changes module which used to monitor cluster stability and restart the scanner on node connects and disconnect (membership checks happen in doc processor). The only thing left from `couch_replicator_db_changes` was the `couch_multidb` subsripttion which was moved to the scanner function in the doc_processor.\r\n\r\nSince we removed couch_replicator_db_changes we also don't need the cluster stability monitoring so that module is also removed. The owner function is moved to the utils module and its `unstable` return value eliminated. The membership check in the doc processor will stop jobs immediately but delay their startup so we get the same effect as before with the stability check.\r\n\r\nPreviously the couch_replicator_clustering module also applied an initial startup delay to allow the application to start properly before starting to scan for jobs so to retain compatibility that setting was moved to doc processor.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior should be covered by tests in the doc processor. Since the tests were updated, took the opportunity to switch the doc processor tests suites to use `TDEF_FE` macro, which removes few redundant setup lines (begin/end

Overview\r\n\r\nUsers of JWT rightly expect tokens to be considered invalid once they expire. It is a surprise to some that this requires a change to the default configuration. In the interest of security we will now require a valid `exp` claim in tokens. Administrators can disable the check by changing `required_claims` back to the empty string.\r\n\r\nWe do not add `nbf` as a required claim as it seems to not be set often in practice.\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nEnhance couchdb to efficiently reject requests for a given user if repeated requests have failed for authentication reasons, from the same IP address. This helps slow brute-force password attacks and is especially helpful if each authentication attempt is very expensive (pbkdf2 with a high iteration count, typically).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nwill be covered by automated tests\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are

Overview\r\n\r\nNouveau has a (somewhat ugly) extension to the query syntax that auto-detects if the searched _value_ is a number. if so,\r\nit switches to querying the field as a number.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you've indexed a string that looks like a number, this behaviour prevents you from querying the field correctly.\r\n\r\nInstead of that, this PR switches to the 'normal' approach in Lucene, namely the StandardQueryParser with a \"points config\"\r\nthat details which fields are numbers. With this extra information the query parser performs the correct kind of query for text or string fields that happen to have values that look like numbers and double fields, which actually have numbers.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem is that we don't declare a schema ahead of time, so we don't know which fields are numbers and which are not. In this PR the type of a field is determined by the type of value that's indexed into it first, it cannot be changed after that. this information is written into the commit data of the index.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ncovered by tests\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4997\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is

application to scan the cluster with a plugin system to report various things about databases and documents. The initial idea was to have something like this to scan all the javascript design docs to check for compatibility with the new QuickJS engine. It had since been split apart from the QuickJS branch and made into a separate pull request.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation includes two plugins:\r\n  * couch_scanner_plugin_find : scan for regexes in doc bodies\r\n  * couch_scanner_ddoc_features : report various design doc features\r\n\r\nA more detailed description is in the README.md file. The plugin API is defined in the `couch_scanner_plugin` module. There are additional details in the comments in the included Erlang modules. What follows is as summary description\r\nof some of the implementation details and features.\r\n\r\nPlugins are managed as individual process by the `couch_scanner_server` with the `start_link/1` and `stop/1` functions. After a plugin runner process is spawned, `couch_scanner_server` wait for it to exit. A process may exit with an error, then it will be penalized with an exponential back-off, or it may also exit with a special `{shutdown, {reschedule, TSec}}` value, in which case it will be rescheduled to run again on or after the `TSec` time.\r\n\r\nAfter the plugin process process starts, it will load and validate its plugin module. Then, it will start scanning all the dbs and docs on the local node. Shard ranges will be scanned only on one of the cluster nodes to avoid duplicating work. For instance, if there are 2 shard ranges, `0-7`, `8-f`, with copies on nodes `n1`, `n2`, `n3`. Then, `0-7` might be scanned on `n1` only, and `8-f` on `n3`.\r\n\r\nDuring various events the plugin process will call into the plugin module: on startup, when resuming from a checkpoint, when checkpointing, when processing a new db, design doc, a document, and when completing a scan. The plugin may accumulate reporting data, or may indicate that some parts of the scan should be skipped, or that the scanning session should be reset.\r\n\r\nBy default all plugins are disabled. Plugins are enabled and managed via the config system. To enable a plugin, add a `$plugin = true` entry in the `[couch_scanner_plugins]` section. For example:\r\n```ini\r\n[couch_scanner_plugins]\r\ncouch_scanner_plugin_ddoc_features = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins can be configured to run on or after a particular date and time or to run periodically. That can be configured via `[$plugin] after = ...` and `[$plugin] repeat = ...` settings. For instance, to run after `2024-03-20T15:00` and then run every Monday:\r\n```ini\r\n[couch_scanner_plugin_ddoc_features]\r\nafter = 2024-03-20T15:00\r\nrepeat = monday\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default values for `after` and `repeat` is ` = restart`, meaning to run once after the node starts up.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the plugins from consuming too may resources. There is a simple rate limiter which limits how many databases, shard and documents should e processed by all the plugins. Rate limits are configurable:\r\n```ini\r\n[couch_scanner]\r\ndb_rate_limit = 25\r\nshard_rate_limit = 50\r\ndoc_rate_limit = 1000\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-24T03:33:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T18:36:33Z","closed_at":"2024-04-12T18:32:36Z","merged_at":"2024-04-12T18:32:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"ceb2277204ac0db38dfd404705da82b917720898","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b129f82a9f9892ba7766383ee765578f0554c19e","head":{"label":"apache:scanner","ref":"scanner","sha":"b129f82a9f9892ba7766383ee765578f0554c19e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
