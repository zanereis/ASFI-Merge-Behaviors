SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR solves a bug caused by a number of small errors that separate are harmless:\r\n\r\nBug 1. When running `load-examples` the datasets created from configs (https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset/examples/configs/datasets/examples) were loaded with schema set to null. The bug was fixed in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16041, but there are many datasets in the wild with `NULL` as their schema.\r\n\r\nBug 2. When following the [dashboard creation tutorial](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/first-dashboard) the user is instructed to create a dataset called `cleaned_sales_data` in the `public` schema. This results in **two** datasets with the same name:\r\n\r\n1. `[NULL].cleaned_sales_data` with UUID A (added without a schema by `load-examples`)\r\n2. `public.cleaned_sales_data` with UUID B (added with a schema by the user)\r\n\r\nThis **shouldn't be possible**, because `tables` had a uniqueness constraint of `database_id, table_name` at the time: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/a786373fffe1a5dc5e2419505f982b14dcc09305/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L486\r\n\r\nBut the logic was enforced by the application, not the DB.\r\n\r\nIf the user now runs `load-examples` again (with the fix from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16041) we'll try to import the dataset **with the schema**, `public.cleaned_sales_data`, with the same UUID (\"A\"). The helper `import_from_dict` will then run a query similar to this to check for uniqueness:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM tables WHERE (name='cleaned_sales_data' AND `schema`='public') OR uuid='A'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this returns both datasets.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to delete all the datasets that have schema set to `NULL` (assuming they should have one), and then run `load-examples` again. But this would overwrite any custom datasets created by users.\r\n\r\nInstead, I changed the `load-examples` script to skip an import when duplicates are found. This should affect a small number of datasets, and since we have made no changes to the `cleaned_sales_data` dataset it's fine to skip it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nTo replicate:\r\n\r\n1. Run `load-examples` with a SHA before https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16041 was merged.\r\n2. Add a dataset called `cleaned_sales_data` in a given schema.\r\n3. Check that there are 2 datasets called `cleaned_sales_data`, one with schema and another without.\r\n4. Upgrade to post-https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16041.\r\n5. Run `load-examples` again, it should work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a new conditional formatting type to the pivot table viz that automatically infers the lower and upper bounds of the color scale. In addition a db migration migrates heatmap coloring from the previous version of the Pivot Table V2 chart to the new conditional formatting control. This is done by applying conditional formatting on all metrics with red scale using the new `None` operator (infer cutoff and extreme value from cell values). While this does not provide a 1-1 feature mapping to the previous version of the plugin, it's the closest match that is possible to be achieved with the new formatting control.\r\n\r\nThis PR requires the following `superset-ui` PRs to function properly (in `superset-ui` version `0.17.78` which is now on master):\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1264\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1269\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nBefore the removal of the heatmap feature, the Pivot Table v2 chart provided six different conditional formatting options; heatmap and bar across all, row and column values:\r\n<img width=\"1713\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-08-03 at 14 45 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128039411-4b2775a7-2bca-413d-a230-80721b1a0a18.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of the new conditional formatting feature, those charts lost their coloring:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128040192-7ff27bce-65e6-4a2d-837f-f30b57eae4aa.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the migration the charts will display colored cells again. As can be seen, the bar option has been removed, along with row/column orientations (now formatting is always done per metric).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128161666-07582fcc-4a97-4b6b-b222-53ad4d4dbf34.png)\r\n\r\nThe new automatic conditional formatting control option, which doesn't have a target value:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/128161774-203d80c1-6473-4954-937c-75293f75852d.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nReplaces the select for a dropdown button in the CSS editor. The dropdown button is more adequate to the current behavior where a user loads a template in the editor. In the previous version, the selection was not being preserved while interacting with the select and it shouldn't because the user is not editing the template but only copying its content to the editor. This was an indication that we were using the wrong component for the desired functionality.\r\n\r\nI also changed the editor border to use the theme colors and anchored the menu to the right to display CSS templates with big names.\r\n\r\n@junlincc @jinghua-qa @rusackas \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we import examples the schema is set to `null`, even in databases that support schemas and have a default schema. This is problematic, because users might create duplicate physical datasets, which are usually not allowed, resulting in, eg:\r\n\r\n- `examples.NULL.birth_names` (actually in the default \"public\" schema, for Postgres)\r\n- `examples.public.birth_names`\r\n\r\nThese duplicate datasets have caused problems in the past, because they break assumptions about physical datasets.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `load-examples` command and the import mechanism to explicitly set the schema to the default one when one is not set.\r\n\r\nThere's a tricky case that this PR needs to handle: when a user creates a dataset duplicating one of the new [examples defined in YAML files](https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset/examples/configs/datasets/examples). These datasets have fixed UUIDs, and the following happens:\r\n\r\n1. Admin runs `superset load-examples`.\r\n2. Dataset `users` is created with `table_name=users`, `schema=null` and `uuid=7195db6b-2d17-7619-b7c7-26b15378df8c`.\r\n3. Later a user creates a physical dataset pointing to `users`. When adding a dataset we force the user to select a schema, so this dataset has `table_name=users`, `schema=public` (in Postgres) and a random UUID. Normally you can't create duplicate physical datasets, but because the schema is technically different this works.\r\n4. Admin runs `superset load-examples` again, after merging this PR.\r\n5. The importer sees that the `users` dataset matches the one with NULL schema, based on the UUID. it tries to update that dataset, setting its schema to \"public\".\r\n6. This fails because there's already a dataset with the same `database_id`, `table_name` and `schema` (the one created by the user).\r\n\r\nThis is a rare case, but it can happen. I added a workaround so that when this happens the duplicate datasets are not updated. This could be potentially problematic in the future, if we add more columns to a dataset and have charts use those columns; then the charts would fail to render because the dataset wouldn't be updated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Run `superset load-examples` on `master`.\r\n2. Datasets have no schema.\r\n3. Run `superset load-examples` on this branch.\r\n4. Datasets have a schema if appropriate (for Postgresl, \"public\").\r\n\r\nSame for clean installations. I tested with Postgresql, MySQL, and SQLite.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe're currently storing `schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload` incorrectly in the DB:\r\n\r\n1. When no schemas are defined we store the **string** `'[]'` in the DB, when the right value would be the **array** `[]`.\r\n2. When one or more schemas are defined we store them as a **single string** (eg, `\"schema1\"` or `\"schema1,schema2\"`) instead of a **list of strings** (`[\"schema1\"]`, `[\"schema1\", \"schema2\"]`).\r\n\r\nThis PR is a quick fix to solve the problem. It stores `schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload` as `string[]` only, serializing and deserializing at the form interface.\r\n\r\nI also changed the placeholder text, since there's no hint to the user how the schemas should be formatted. Ideally we'd offer a dropdown from which the user would be able to select multiple schemas, but in the meantime offering an example `schema1,schema2` should be enough.\r\n\r\nThis PR also has a DB migration that fixes the incorrect values. I tested by creating a DB in `master`, verifying that the `extra` was saved incorrectly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"metadata_params\": {},\r\n  \"engine_params\": {},\r\n  \"metadata_cache_timeout\": {},\r\n  \"schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload\": \"[]\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running the migration:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"metadata_params\": {},\r\n  \"engine_params\": {},\r\n  \"metadata_cache_timeout\": {},\r\n  \"schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSome databases were saved with `schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload` as a JSON string, instead of a JSON object. When these databases are exported the ZIP payload has the incorrect schema, and can't be imported.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the export, so that these databases are exported with the correct schema; and the import, so that any databases that were eventually exported can be imported.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nBefore applying this PR, create a DB using the new custom form. Check that the DB is saved with incorrect `extra`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n {\"metadata_params\":{},\"engine_params\":{},\"schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload\":\"[]\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the payload is incorrect becase `schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload` should be an array, not a string. One way to save a DB with the incorrect format like above is to add a schema, save the DB, remove the schema, and save the DB again.\r\n\r\nExport the DB, the YAML will look like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndatabase_name: MySQL\r\nsqlalchemy_uri: mysql+mysqldb://root@localhost:3306/MySQL\r\ncache_timeout: null\r\nexpose_in_sqllab: true\r\nallow_run_async: false\r\nallow_ctas: false\r\nallow_cvas: false\r\nallow_csv_upload: false\r\nextra:\r\n  metadata_params: {}\r\n  engine_params: {}\r\n  schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload: '[]'\r\nuuid: 8bf58f76-c884-49d2-8612-d94d3ca1d1aa\r\nversion: 1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen importing the file it will fail the validation, because `schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload` is a string.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the import will work. Additionally, when exporting the incorrectly saved database the output YAML will look like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndatabase_name: MySQL\r\nsqlalchemy_uri: mysql+mysqldb://root@localhost:3306/MySQL\r\ncache_timeout: null\r\nexpose_in_sqllab: true\r\nallow_run_async: false\r\nallow_ctas: false\r\nallow_cvas: false\r\nallow_csv_upload: false\r\nextra:\r\n  metadata_params: {}\r\n  engine_params: {}\r\n  schemas_allowed_for_csv_upload: []\r\nuuid: 8bf58f76-c884-49d2-8612-d94d3ca1d1aa\r\nversion: 1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEncoding time durations (timeout, wait, etc.) as `int` seems un-Pythonic in world of typing. Furthermore:\r\n\r\n- It is not apparent whether a duration is in seconds, milliseconds, etc.\r\n- There are inconsistencies in how these config variables are defined, e.g. we have `SQLLAB_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT` and `SQLLAB_ASYNC_TIME_LIMIT_SEC`, where the later encodes the temporal units in the name.\r\n\r\nUsing `datetime.timedelta` remedies both these problems, i.e., `timedelta(hours=1)`. This PR merely seeds this mindset (in the context of the configs) by replacing constructs like, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nSCREENSHOT_LOAD_WAIT = 60\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n```python\r\nSCREENSHOT_LOAD_WAIT = int(timedelta(minutes=1).total_seconds())\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas in the future it should simply be\r\n\r\n```python\r\nSCREENSHOT_LOAD_WAIT: timedelta = timedelta(minutes=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the code is updated to expect a `datetime.timedelta` object.\r\n\r\nNote I raised https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/issues/266 to see whether Flask-Caching would consider adding native support for using a `datetime.timedelta` object which would further simplify the code if we adopted this pattern.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user tried to drag and drop value from a control to a different control of the same type, an undefined error occurred. The root of the issue was in reordering logic - in order the rearrange values, control's dnd handler had to accept a given drag item type. However if there were more controls of the same type in control panel, user could drag them to the other control, which wasn't handled in any way. This PR fixes the issue by changing control's dnd type from a generic one (like \"Column\", \"Metric\" etc.) to a more specific one (old type concatenated with control's name and label to ensure uniqueness).\r\nIn the future, we'll enhance the DnD experience by allowing user to drag and drop items across different controls (instead of prohibiting it). However, that will require deeper, riskier changes, so for now let's just fix the \"undefined\" error with this PR.\r\nWhile I was at it, I introduced a few simple performance improvements - mostly wrapping stuff in useCallbacks and useMemos.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16009\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/127839347-f0e4e9af-c10c-4e8c-a426-03987e8180d7.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable drag and drop\r\n1. Create a chart which has multiple controls of the same type, for example table or pivot table\r\n2. Add values to controls of the same type (e.g Metric and Percentage Metric in Table, or Columns and Rows in Pivot Table)\r\n3. Try to drag a value from 1 control to the other.\r\n4. Verify that nothing happened and no \"undefined\" error is shown\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes native filter metadata in versioned import/export of dashboards by doing the following:\r\n- export all datasets referenced in native filters, even those not referenced by charts in dashboard.\r\n- replaces `datasetId` with `datasetUuid` in native filter targets to ensure that dataset reference is based on UUID, not numeric id.\r\n\r\nOther bycatch fixes that were found while testing:\r\n- Fix datatype of `query_context` in `ImportV1ChartSchema`, which should be `String`, not `Dict` (caused a marshmallow schema validation exception). Also make it accept `None` values and add JSON validation.\r\n- `datasource_type` in `dataset_info` was set as `view` if the table was a virtual table, which caused an exception when importing virtual datasets. Since virtual datasets are in fact regular `table` datasources, we just reference the `datasource_type` of the imported dataset.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nNow native filter targets are referencing `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/127825419-d0e82a8e-19c3-4afa-87c0-77ee4bd2f4ce.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. enable the \"VERSIONED_EXPORT\" feature flag\r\n2. export a dashboard that had only one chart and two native filters, one referencing the same dataset as the chart and another not referenced by the chart\r\n3. check that the native filter configurations in the dashboard metadata contain `datasetUuid` instead of `datasetId` references\r\n4. delete the exported dashboard, chart and dataset only referenced by the native filter\r\n5. import the exported bundle\r\n6. make sure the imported dashboard works correctly, and that both datasets are imported correctly and native filter configurations are correct\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR add extra fix for #15891. After #15891, in airbnb some user found SQL Lab was running old SQL query after they update. it happens more often when open a new tab in sql lab. See #15992.\r\n\r\nI found there are few issues:\r\n1. when new query tab is added, which triggered redux store change, there are many re-render for every existed query tabs, even if the tab is not the top active one. \r\n2. when user update sql, there is a race condition: trigger in-component callback function runQuery vs global redux store update with new Sql statement.\r\n3. there is a 2-seconds debounce for Sql Editor to response sql change. this debounce make global redux update almost never win local call runQuery.\r\n\r\nSo I added few fixes:\r\n1. add logic to only render active tab\r\n2. remove some of change introduced in #15891. keep a copy of current sql statement in local state.\r\n3. reduce debounce from 2 seconds to 1 second.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn the staleness logic, it was only looking at the changes in controls since the last render of the

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug introduced by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15699: when the `/dashboard/<dashboardId>/datasets` API is slow and the FilterBox is rendered before this API is returned, it will fail and show a JS error:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/127717135-33a6fa18-3cd5-4a52-9a1e-8c9dd2a58806.mp4\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the async re-rendering process more robust by:\r\n\r\n1. Fixing the code in FilterBox that is causing the JS error\r\n2. Introduce a `PLACEHOLDER_DATASOURCE` for all chart renderers so similar JS errors will not happen for other charts which forgot to handle the case when `datasource` is not loaded.\r\n3. Don't render JS errors when chart's `datasource` is `PLACEHOLDER_DATASOURCE`. After the API is successfully returned, chart reducer will trigger a re-render.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/127717159-5c53c35d-42ee-48e2-899b-c32a5edf0ecf.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Insert \r\n\r\n```python\r\n            import time\r\n\r\n            time.sleep(3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/327fb60b81d19c0d158e9836b017f40d0bd99375/superset/dashboards/api.py#L333) to mock a slow response for the `/datasets` API.\r\n2. Create a dashboard with Filterbox, select a couple of filter columns with verbose names (change column `Label` in datasource editor).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

ran a query quickly. Reverting this PR for now.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nN/A, but how I tested the bug:\r\n1. Go to sql lab\r\n2. Type \"SELECT 1\"\r\n3. Wait ~10 seconds\r\n4. Quickly modify the query to be \"SELECT 2\" and click \"Run\"\r\n5. Observe which query was run (1 or 2)\r\n\r\nI confirmed that before this change, the incorrect query was run (SELECT 1), and after this change, the correct query was run (SELECT 2).\r\n\r\nto:

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nDatabases are not saving because we're sending `query` as a string due to the incorrect check.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem, but I think we should spend some cycles improving state in the frontend. Having `query` be a string sometimes, and an object other times will certainly lead to more bugs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nI'm downgrading pivot-table back to version 0.17.67 because we have people using this visualization reporting breaking changes with conditional formatting from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15742 and superset-ui has been too active for me to fix forward in this case.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if there's still a lot of development on this visualization, however since it's not behind a feature flag we had people actively using it in production, and therefore need to prevent regressions here. I'm hoping that we can merge fixes into superset-ui and then upgrade back to a fully functional version that either migrates the old charts to use the new controls properly or fixes the regression.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere are some deprecate visualizations in Superset, for instance:\r\n- nvd3 chart\r\n- legacy pivot table\r\nAnd these visualizations are often replaced with new versions: echart or pivot-table-v2\r\n\r\nThis script provides an approach to migrate legacy visualizations. \r\n\r\ncurrently, This script only migrates `pivot table` to `pivot table v2`\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\n$ superset migrate-viz -t pivot_table\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

TEST PLAN\r\nThis solution works and is tested with Teradata Vantage, but we are happy to make other modifications if the team supports.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe request all realtes to the follwoing bug\r\n\r\nNew or Changed Public Interfaces\r\nThe present proposal requires no new or changed public interfaces.\r\n\r\n### New dependencies\r\nOnly for Teradata connections, the present proposal requires the installation of\r\n\r\nthe teradatasqlalchemy connector, and\r\nthe teradatasql driver\r\npackages to connect to a Teradata Vantage system Advanced SQL Engine Database.\r\nThese packages are actively maintained and their licenses are Teradata proprietary. The teradatasql license can be found at:\r\nhttps://github.com/Teradata/python-driver/blob/master/LICENSE\r\nwhereas the teradatasqlalchemy code is not publicly posted at this point.\r\n\r\nMigration Plan and Compatibility\r\nNo migration is necessary. The proposed code changes are an extension and non-destructive to the existing code, thus not affecting existing compatibility.","created_at":"2021-07-28T18:03:43Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T03:16:16Z","closed_at":"2022-02-01T03:16:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4a02a38cde77f8b14809169e5df0cedeeb11358","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/15930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/15930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/15930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/e547a9573a619b0423a97069eff2bbf52d19abcf","head":{"label":"mccushjack:master","ref":"master","sha":"e547a9573a619b0423a97069eff2bbf52d19abcf","user":{"login":"mccushjack","id":33156805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTU2ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33156805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack","html_url":"https://github.com/mccushjack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373631494,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM2MzE0OTQ=","name":"superset","full_name":"mccushj

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAt Airbnb we're testing using the `celery beat` command for dedicated reporting. The issue we're running into is the  application fails to beat after a period of time. Though there is no guarantee that this is an issue with Celery, I thought it was at least prudent to bump Celery as per the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/celery/#history) we're at least 12 months behind the latest release. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and verified that our docs, scripts, etc. have [Celery 5.x compliant](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/history/whatsnew-5.0.html#step-1-adjust-your-command-line-invocation) CLI commands.  \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a timezone selector to alerts and reports, allowing users to have a more intuitive experience as to when the reports will be triggered. The page will \"guess\" at the user's location/timezone and pre-populate the dropdown with that zone, or preload with the saved value on edit. Users can edit the timezone. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![_DEV__Superset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/127243976-dcca920d-ee40-4cea-a7eb-36954225bb32.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to a new alert/report or edit an existing one. Select a timezone and save the alert/report. The alert/report should fire at that timezone and not UTC (unless UTC is selected).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nMoves the SQL Lab menu before Charts to make it workflow-oriented. Generally, the most common workflow is:\r\n1. to connect with database in Data, Persona: Data scientist. \r\n2. to explore raw data, cleanup and restructure data if needed, prepare data for exploration by creating virtual datasets in SQL Lab, etc, Persona: Data scientist \r\n3. to explore, slice, and dice data, and to create charts for a dashboard in Explore(Chart); Persona: Data analyst\r\n4. to view and edit dashboard in Dashboard Persona: Business analyst/business users.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is to reorder the objects by usage, and the order would be the opposite. Dashboards -> Charts -> SQL Lab -> Data. This argument may seem counterintuitive to DS, as DS spends the majority of their time handling data. But the number of dashboard consumers is way larger than dashboard creators in large enterprises.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"495\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-27

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe DAO model which @dpgaspar, @villebro, et al. added goes a long way to making https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5449 obsolete, i.e., it has the necessary existence checks when creating or updating a table. \r\n\r\nThere are however at least two issues,\r\n\r\n1. The Datasource Editor still uses the legacy  `/datasource/save/` endpoint (per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b83ee46d0f15cec76b340cb2740c25e96b9afde2/superset-frontend/src/datasource/DatasourceModal.tsx#L104)) rather than the DAO model and so the existence logic is not invoked on update.\r\n\r\n2. The legacy CRUD Editor does not use the DAO model.\r\n\r\nmeaning it is currently possible to rename a dataset resulting in multiple datasets with the same schema and table name. \r\n\r\nThough these issues should be resolved once we fully deprecate the CRUD editor and migrate over to the DAO model, I felt it was prudent to add an interim check which enforces uniqueness. Given then various vectors I thought the simplest and safest path was to leverage the approach in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5449 and add a SQLAlchemy before update listener.  Note although the UX may not be ideal, my sense is it is suffice as an interim measure.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Editing/Updating via the Datasource

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSlack requires `chat:write` as part of \"OAuth & Permissions\" for the slack integration to be able to post messages.\r\nIf the mentioned scope is not defined, one will receive following error from Slack API\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: The request to the Slack API failed. The server responded with: {'ok': False, 'error': 'missing_scope', 'needed': 'chat:write:bot', 'provided': 'incoming-webhook,files:write'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n_**To reproduce the problem**_\r\n1. Add slack integration as per current instructions\r\n2. Invite the app to the target slack channel\r\n3. Schedule an alert to be posted on specific channel\r\n4.

SUMMARY\r\nFix an issue that SQL Lab didn't run correct sql after user pick a query from History. The root cause is that after update selected sql in redux store, component state is out of sync from props.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution for this PR is to remove `sql` from component local state, and always use props which sync from redux store.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nStep to reproduce:\r\n1. open sql lab\r\n2. run a sql statement\r\n3. pick a query from History tab\r\n4. you will see SQL Editor updated with the picked query\r\n5. Click Run button\r\n6. The query result is not correct: query result is actually from the previous sql statement.\r\n![mIJImvnPa8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/126917304-014bc853-4b6b-438e-bbc9-0c4c935543b1.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n@jinghua-qa It's a little troublesome to add unit test for this bug.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, Superset is unable to auto sync table columns when changing dataset \"pointer/reference\". This issue introduces a new API to support.\r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\nCurrently, the dataset system is unable to save duplicated datasets (database/schema/table all the same). If \"re-pointer\" an existing dataset, the database will return an integrity error. I will fix it in separate PR.\r\n\r\nUI Change:\r\nNot allowed to click `sync columns from source` when dataset in EDIT mode. The system will automatically complete the sync.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15789\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/126888828-0581c206-bcd2-44cf-9d9d-b764395a52c8.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n#### \r\n1. Open `edit dataset` modal in dataset list\r\n2. change table(Whether `physical table` or `virtual table`), schema, database\r\n3. Observe columns, auto sync table columns.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAllows plugins to be deprecated by flipping the `deprecated` metadata flag. When a plugin is deprecated, it will still work as normal but will not show up in the viz gallery.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are no plugins shipping with Superset that have the `deprecated` flag enabled, so this will have no impact on the application except in environments that override the default configuration.\r\n\r\nWhen opening the viz gallery while exploring a chart that is deprecated, the chart's viz type will not show up in the gallery list, but the detail pane will be populated with the deprecated chart's description, tags, and examples. If you change viz type from a deprecated viz to a non-deprecated viz, and save, there will not be a way to change it back.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Add a dynamic plugin or use `npm link` to register a plugin locally\r\n2. Add `deprecated: true` to your plugin's metadata\r\n3. The plugin will not show up in the viz gallery\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nThese changes add a new component for choosing timezones client side. It uses the timezone list from moment-timezone which has about 400 entries. To narrow that list for a UI dropdown, I have removed all duplicates (based on their standard and daylight timezone offsets). There is a map that makes some of these selections more readable; for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\" is a duplicate of Vancouver, so we map it to \"Pacific Standard/Daylight Time\". In a v2 I may see if there's a simple way to pull that name out of moment, but for now, there's a map of about 7-8 regions that seem to work. \r\nThere's a migration and some changes coming next that will implement this into reports. For now these changes should have no UI impact, and just introduce the component and storybook files. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nExample from storybook showing \"UTC\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBoth the Hive and Presto live cursors have implicit async handling to cancel queries, however post https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15403 when you stop a query in SQL Lab it incorrectly mentioned that the query could not be stopped and thus prevented to user from iterating within the SQL editor.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new method to check if the database implicitly handles the canceling of queries. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15482 we construct a new `SupersetError` (with corresponding message, error type, and level) rather than merely leveraging the mandatory `SupersetError` which raised as part of the `SupersetSecurityException`. \r\n\r\nThese errors contain specifics (message, error type, etc.) which differ depending on the type of exception ([example](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/security/manager.py#L410-L418))‚Äîwhich also may be custom for security manager overrides‚Äîand thus should be preserved.\r\n\r\nThis PR merely uses the previous `SupersetError` (which is guaranteed to exist per the [SupersetSecurityException](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/02032ee8a478ab9578cf6e13a7645a8b4106be58/superset/exceptions.py#L130-L137) signature) rather than constructing a new error.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any
