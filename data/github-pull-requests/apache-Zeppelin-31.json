What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n**Most fixes are about fixing lint errors. It's automatically applied by executing `eslint --fix` command.**\r\n**So please review `Gruntfile.js`, `.eslint`, `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` in `zeppelin-web` directory**\r\n\r\nAs a result of the PR,\r\n\r\n- Restored javascript lint system\r\n- Fixed 1200+ lint errors automatically\r\n- Found some buggy code (e.g `Unexpected 'this' no-invalid-this` See the screenshot section)\r\n\r\nWe are using google style guide but it is not used at all because of invalid `.eslint` configuration. Thus I made some changes to fix it.\r\n\r\n- Moved eslint from grunt to webpack (faster)\r\n- Changed invalid config `\"preset\": \"google\"` to `\"extends\": [\"google\"]`\r\n- Fixed 1200+ lint errors automatically using `eslint --fix` command\r\n- Left some lint errors i cannot fix immediately as warnings or disabled\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"guard-for-in\": [1],             // warning\r\n

we can keep clear, unified rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Moved eslint (build) task from grunt to npm (package.json)\r\n* [x] - Brought eslint (dev) task from grunt to webpack\r\n* [x] - Fixed `.eslint` to applied google ruleset\r\n* [x] - Modifed some lint errors while leaving others as warning which i cannot fix right now

+ sqlcompleter tests\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR changes autocompletion behaviour in jdbc interpeter.\r\nThere are some changes:\r\n* [main change] autocompletion now depends on what are you typing. Now there are four types of competion: schema, table, column and keywords. If you typing new word then autocompetion suggests only keywords and schema names. If you are typing after schema name with point then you get list of tables in that schema. Also if you typing a name after point after a table name you will get a list of column names of this table.\r\n* autocomption now supports aliases in sql. If you write alias for a table in sql you will get a list of columns for an aliased table if you write down alias and point.\r\n* autocompletion now load keywords only in low case (otherwise there are so many keywords in a list of autocompletion that it is becomes uncomfortable)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - sort names in the output of autocompletion\r\n* [ ] - list only schema names if we are typing a schema name (for example after keywork FROM)\r\n* [ ] - add description in autocompletion list for schema names - schema, for table names - table and so\r\n* [ ] - autocompletion must initialize on opening of interpeter (not only after execution of sql)\r\n* [ ] - update autocompletion schemas only after execute update sql, not after every sql ???\r\n* [ ] - new option for postgresql interpreter: postgresql.completer.schema.filter. Filter schema names loaded into autocompletion (no more garbage schema names).\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845228/auto1.JPG\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845229/auto2.JPG\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845230/auto3.JPG\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to download fonts files whenever we build.\r\n\r\n- Google font doesn't change frequently.\r\n- We can use google fonts in open source

tested?\r\n\r\n1. Install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)\r\n2. Make sure that your python interpreter can use `conda` (check the Interpreter Binding page)\r\n3. Remove `test` conda env since we will create in the following section\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ conda env remove --yes --name test\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Run these commands with `%python.conda`\r\n\r\n```\r\n%python.conda info\r\n%python.conda env list\r\n%python.conda create --name test\r\n\r\n# you should be able to see `test` in the list\r\n%python.conda env list\r\n%python.conda activate pymysql\r\n%python.conda install pymysql\r\n\r\n# you should be able to import\r\n%python\r\nimport pymysql.cursors\r\n\r\n%python.conda uninstall pymysql\r\n%python.conda deactivate pymysql\r\n\r\n# you should be able to see `No module named pymysql.cursor` since we deactivated\r\n%python\r\nimport pymysql.cursors\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently Zeppelin `%md` result style is using [`github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).

So there is no problem to get the interpreter setting lists. \r\n\r\n - Shiro on\r\ntries to get interpreter setting lists as '  ' user since we're not loggined yet. \r\n![shiroon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676414/db03515a-d378-11e6-99c9-34775e07a2e8.png) \r\nSo it's failed to get interpreter setting lists since it doesn't have any user info. It needs reloading to get it. \r\n![whenshiroon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676657/e08ee03e-d379-11e6-8844-6baa673e0308.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nActually we don't need to send `GET_INTERPRETER_SETTINGS` msg when Zeppelin started. It would be fine when we click \"Create new note\" button. So I removed `init()` (it's used only for getting interpreter settings) and made `getInterpreterSettings` called only when user clicks \"Create new note\" in both Zeppelin home and Navbar. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1902)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nIn master (not this branch)\r\n1. [Turn Shiro on](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/security/shiroauthentication.html#1-enable-shiro) and start(restart) Zeppelin \r\n2. Click \"Create new note\" in home (or Navbar)\r\n3. the default interpreter select box will be like \r\n![screen shot 2017-01-05 at 7 16 08 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21676986/7a005a80-d37b-11e6-80d9-1597914c4b05.png)\r\n\r\nbut it'll be okay after reloading.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nFixed **Clear all paragraphs** button in a note (I attached a screenshot)\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n- `NotebookServer.java` sends the `NOTE` websocket message\r\n- But `notebook.controller.js` doens't apply the result properly since it has invalid impl\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  $scope.$on('setNoteContent', function(event, note) {\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      if ($scope.note === null) { // only set if the note is empty? what if already created?\r\n        $scope.note = note;\r\n      } else {\r\n        $scope.note.config.personalizedMode = note.config.personalizedMode;\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The reason I fixed `if (!$scope.editor || !$scope.editor.isFocused())` (in `paragraph.controll.js`) is because i am getting this type error whenever i click `Run all paragraphs` button after commit 7f95b9b (in this PR)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nangular.js:13236 TypeError: Cannot read property 'isFocused' of null\r\n    at ChildScope.ParagraphCtrl.$scope.scrollToCursor (paragraph.controller.js:718)\r\n    at paragraph.controller.js:708\r\n    at Scope.$broadcast (angular.js:17143)\r\n    at

issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1905](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1905)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Open a note\r\n2. Run some paragraphs.\r\n3. Click the **Run all paragraphs** button.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![clear-all-output-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/21660976/391d5010-d315-11e6-9ad0-c4feff32eee6.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrent helium plugin application api (experimental) requires create library in java class, and need to create both backend / frontend code in the package. Which is good if your plugin requires both frontend and backend code running.\r\n\r\nHowever, when user just want to make new visualization which completely runs on front-end side in javascript, creating helium application in java project and taking care of backend code can be bit of overhead and barrier for javascript developers.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability to load pure javascript package as a visualization.\r\n\r\n### how it works\r\n\r\n1. create (copy, download) 'helium package json' file into `ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium` directory.\r\n  The json file point visualization js package in npm repository or local file system in `artifact` field.   \r\n  `type` field in the json file need to be `VISUALIZATION`\r\n\r\nHere's an example (zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar.json)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" : \"VISUALIZATION\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"zeppelin_horizontalbar\",\r\n  \"description\" : \"Horizontal Bar chart (example)\",\r\n  \"artifact\" : \"./zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar\",\r\n  \"icon\" : \"<i class='fa fa-bar-chart rotate90flipX'></i>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Go to helium GUI menu. (e.g. http://localhost:8080/#/helium).\r\n  The menu will list all available packages. \r\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"writing_visualization_helium_menu\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/21749660/0f401c10-d558-11e6-9961-b6d0a9c023d8.png\">\r\n\r\n \r\n3. click 'enable' in any package want to use. \r\nOnce a visualization package is enabled, `HeliumVisualizationFactory` will collect all enabled visualizations and create js bundle on the fly.\r\n\r\n4. js bundle will be loaded on notebook and additional visualization becomes available\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/21749729/709b2b3e-d559-11e6-8318-7f2871e7c39a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Programming API to create new plugin visualization.\r\n\r\nSimply extends [visualization.js](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/visualization.js) and overrides some methods, such as\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * get transformation\r\n   */\r\n  getTransformation() {\r\n    // override this\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Method will be invoked when data or configuration changed\r\n   */\r\n  render(tableData) {\r\n    // override this\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Refresh visualization.\r\n   */\r\n  refresh() {\r\n    // override this\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * method will be invoked when visualization need to be destroyed.\r\n   * Don't need to destroy this.targetEl.\r\n   */\r\n  destroy() {\r\n    // override this\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * return {\r\n   *   template : angular template string or url (url should end with .html),\r\n   *   scope : an object to bind to template scope\r\n   * }\r\n   */\r\n  getSetting() {\r\n    // override this\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the same api that built-in visualization uses.\r\n\r\nan example implementation included `zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/horizontalbar.js`.\r\nActually [all built-in visualizations](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/visualization/builtins) are example\r\n\r\n\r\n### Packaging and publishing visualization\r\n\r\nEach visualization will need `package.json` file (e.g. `zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/package.json`) to be packaged.\r\nPackage can be published in npm repository or package can be deployed to the local filesystem.\r\n\r\n`zeppelin-examples/zeppelin-example-horizontalbar/` is an example package that is deployed in the local filesystem\r\n\r\n### Development mode\r\n\r\nFirst, locally install and enable your development package by setting `artifact` field to the development directory.\r\nThen run zeppelin-web in visualization development mode with following command\r\n```\r\ncd zeppelin-web\r\nnpm run visdev\r\n```\r\nWhen you have change in your local development package, just reload your notebook. Then Zeppelin will automatically rebuild / reload the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Load plugin visualization js package on runtime\r\n* [x] - Make the feature works in zeppelin Binary package\r\n* [x] - Show loading indicator while 'enable' / 'disable' package\r\n* [x] - Add document\r\n* [x] - Add license of new dependency\r\n* [x] - Development mode\r\n* [x] - Propagate error to front-end\r\n* [x] - Display multiple versions of a package.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1619\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBuild Zeppelin with `-Pexamples` flag. That'll install example visualization package `horizontalbar`.\r\nYou'll able to select `horizontalbar` along with other built-in visualizations\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/21655057/27d61740-d26d-11e6-88f2-02c653e102c6.png)\r\n\r\nTo test npm online package install capability,  Place [zeppelin-bubble.json](https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin-bubble/blob/master/zeppelin-bubble.json) in hour local registry (`ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium`) and enable it in Helium gui menu.\r\nAnd then

What is this PR for?\r\nThis is to add spark impersonation using --proxy-user option. note that it enables also to use spark impersonation without having logged user as system user with configured ssh.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - add `--proxy-user`\r\n* [x] - try on standalone spark 1.6.2\r\n* [x] - try on yarn-client mode spark 2.0.1\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nDirectly solves [ZEPPELIN-1730](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1730) and also solves [ZEPPELIN-1587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1587) according to discussion in #1566 since using `--proxy-user` in `spark-submit` is preferable method.\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. switch your spark cluster to `per user` and `isolated` mode\r\n2. set up `user impersonation` flag\r\n3. run some job using that spark interpreter\r\n4. spark context should be created with currently logged in user credentials on behalf of system user\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nstandalone\r\n![spark_sc_impersonation](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1642088/21639292/24240286-d224-11e6-8099-9bc74a06f0c2.gif)\r\n\r\nyarn-client\r\n<img width=\"997\"

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR changes autocompletion behaviour in postgresql interpeter.\r\nThere are some changes:\r\n* [main change] autocompletion now depends on what are you typing. Now there are four types of competion: schema, table, column and keywords. If you typing new word then autocompetion suggests only keywords and schema names. If you are typing after schema name with point then you get list of tables in that schema. Also if you typing a name after point after a table name you will get a list of column names of this table.\r\n* autocomption now supports aliases in sql. If you write alias for a table you will get a list of columns of an aliased table if you write down the alias and a point.\r\n* new option are availble for postgresql interpreter: postgresql.completer.schema.filter. It allows filter schema names loaded into autocompletion (no more garbage schema names).\r\n* autocompletion now load keywords only in low case (otherwise there are so many keywords in a list of autocompletion that it is becomes uncomfortable)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - sort names in the output of autocompletion\r\n* [ ] - list only schema names if we are typing a schema name (for example after keywork FROM)\r\n* [ ] - add description in autocompletion list for schema names - schema, for table names - table and so\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1876\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845228/auto1.JPG\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845229/auto2.JPG\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12845230/auto3.JPG\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR adds Mongo notebook storage.\r\n\r\nThe reason that I made this feature is for HA(High Availability).\r\nS3 and Git storage are the only available method for HA as far as I know.\r\n\r\nI'm managing Ambari cluster in my lab, but Zeppelin is the most vulnerable part of it.\r\nBecause one server contains all Zeppelin notes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by deploying MongoDB's [replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/) and using it as Zeppelin notebook storage, I would like to achieve HA.\r\n\r\n#### The way to use Mongo DB as notebook storage\r\n```sh\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo \r\n```\r\n\r\nor at `zeppelin-site.xml`:\r\n```xml\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>\r\n  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo</value>\r\n  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n#### Configurable environment variables\r\n* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_URI` MongoDB connection URI\r\n* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_DATABASE` Database name\r\n* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_COLLECTION` Collection name\r\n* `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT` If `true`, automatically import your local notes. Default `false`\r\n\r\nThey can be configured at `zeppelin-site.xml` as well:\r\n* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.uri`\r\n* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.database`\r\n* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.collection`\r\n* `zeppelin.notebook.mongo.autoimport`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\nIf we use Mongo DB's [oplog tailing](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-oplog/), maybe multi-server architecture is possible.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Write a documentation for Mongo storage\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1859\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n#### Install MongoDB (if you don't have)\r\n```sh\r\nbrew update\r\nbrew install mongodb\r\n```\r\n#### Build Zepppelin\r\n```sh\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n#### Run Zeppelin wih Mongo storage\r\n```sh\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT=true\r\nbin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart\r\n```\r\nThe default database and collection names are `zeppelin`, `notes` respectively.\r\nAnd `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT` option will automatically import your `local notes` that don't exist in MongoDB.\r\n#### Check whether a document in MongoDB updated\r\nCreate, update, remove a note and open mongo shell:\r\n```sh\r\nmongo zeppelin\r\n```\r\nAnd check state of the note is the same as you think:\r\n```sh\r\ndb.notes.findOne({_id: '<NOTE_ID_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_SEE>'})\r\n```\r\n#### Confirm that configurations works\r\n```sh\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_AUTOIMPORT=true\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_DATABASE=otherdb\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_COLLECTION=mynotes\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017\r\nbin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart\r\n```\r\nThe collection `mynotes` should be created in db `otherdb`.\r\nLet's check it!\r\n```sh\r\nmongo otherdb\r\ndb.mynotes.count()\r\n```\r\nThe result should not be zero.\r\n\r\n#### Confirm that configurations from `zeppelin-site.xml` works\r\nOpen your `conf/zeppelin-site.xml` file (copy from `zeppelin-site.xml.template` if you don't have one), and comment lines below:\r\n```xml\r\n<!--\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>\r\n  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.VFSNotebookRepo</value>\r\n  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>\r\n</property>\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nAnd add lines below:\r\n```xml\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.storage</name>\r\n  <value>org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.MongoNotebookRepo</value>\r\n  <description>notebook persistence layer implementation</description>\r\n</property>\r\n\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.uri</name>\r\n  <value>mongodb://localhost</value>\r\n  <description>MongoDB connection URI used to connect to a MongoDB database server</description>\r\n</property>\r\n\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.database</name>\r\n  <value>zepl</value>\r\n  <description>database name for notebook storage</description>\r\n</property>\r\n\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.collection</name>\r\n  <value>notes</value>\r\n  <description>collection name for notebook storage</description>\r\n</property>\r\n\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.notebook.mongo.autoimport</name>\r\n  <value>false</value>\r\n  <description>import local notes into MongoDB automatically on startup</description>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis time we will import a note via `mongoimport`. I made it possible to import a note from JSON just in case.\r\n```sh\r\ncd $ZEPPELIN_HOME/notebook/<NOTE_ID_YOU_WANT_TO_IMPORT>\r\nmongoimport --db zepl --collection notes --file note.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnsure that your environment variables are clean(just reopen your terminal if you are not), and restart zeppelin:\r\n```sh\r\nbin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart\r\n```\r\nOpen browser and go to `localhost:8080`. The note that you imported should be shown.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? Maybe...? I used [java-mongodb-driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/3.4.1) which has *The Apache Software License, Version 2.0*\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nRemoved [strip-loader](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850) which was added to remove `console.log` in production. \r\nBut we can achieve the same result by using uglify option. I missed it in https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1805\r\n\r\n- `strip-loader` has a bug as you can see in below (screenshot section)\r\n- Deleting it help us to keep the package list simple\r\n- Also using the same configuration for uglify both in webpack and grunt will ensure that vendor package have the consistent behavior when they are managed by webpack\r\n\r\nAlso, this should be merged before https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1812 since we need to modify `yarn.lock` in #1812 \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nDone at once\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Add this code to any js file in master branch and execute `npm run build` to lint. You will get an error\r\n\r\n```\r\n        console.log('editor isn\\'t loaded yet, returning..');\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently we can download table data set as `.csv` or `.tsv` format in Zeppelin note. But since the exported file name is always set as `data.csv`, it will be difficult to distinguish the each file if user tries to export it several times. So I changed the naming rule like below. \r\n\r\n1. if the paragraph has title e.g. `this is title`, then the exported csv file name will be \r\n`this is title_YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss a.csv` .\r\n\r\n2. if not, the file name will be `data_YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss a.csv` .\r\n\r\nPlease see the short discussion in [ZEPPELIN-1789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1789) for the more details. I just made this PR by following one person's opinion who raised this issue (_Ruslan Dautkhanov_ ). So if anyone has better idea, please feel free to share :)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1789)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. run Zeppelin web dev mode under `zeppelin-web` \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. browse `http://localhost:9000` and go to Zeppelin-Spark tutorial note\r\n3. click ![screen shot 2016-12-30 at 2 26 32

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR is about using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) which is ultra faster than npm.\r\nWe can reduce almost 50 sec per every build as you can see below. This will affect on CI build time significantly.\r\n\r\n**It is possible to use `npm` in locally after merging**. this PR is not about disabling NPM. more about using yarn while building to decrease build time.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Setup `pom.xml` to download, use yarn\r\n* [x] - Update `README.md`\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1850)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n- Run this command to compare build time in master and pr branch\r\n\r\n`rm -rf zeppelin-web/bower_components zeppelin-web/node zeppelin-web/node_modules; mvn clean package -pl 'zeppelin-web' -DskipTests`\r\n\r\n- If you want to compare `npm install` and `yarn install` only, \r\n\r\nFirst remove this line in package.json `\"postinstall\": \"bower install --silent && grunt googlefonts\",`\r\nAnd then, execute `npm install` and `yarn install` respectively \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n```\r\n## before\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total
