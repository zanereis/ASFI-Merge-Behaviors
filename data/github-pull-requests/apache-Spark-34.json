Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `With` expression assumes that it should be created after all input expressions are fully resolved. This is mostly true (function lookup happens after function input expressions are resolved), but there is a special case of column resolution in HAVING: we use `TempResolvedColumn` to try one column resolution option. If it doesn't work, re-resolve the column, which may be a different data type. `With` expression should update the refs when this happens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix, otherwise the query will fail\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46338 found `schema_of_variant` sometimes could not correctly handle variant decimals and had a fix. However, I found that the fix is incomplete and `schema_of_variant` can still fail on some inputs. The reason is that `VariantUtil.getDecimal` calls `stripTrailingZeros`. For an input decimal `10.00`,  the resulting scale is -1 and the unscaled value is 1. However, negative decimal scale is not allowed by Spark. The correct approach is to use the `BigDecimal` to construct a `Decimal` and read its precision and scale, as what we did in `VariantGet`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a minor change for `VariantGet`, where a duplicated expression is computed twice.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThey are bug fixes and are required to process decimals correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMore unit tests. Some of them would fail without the change in this PR (e.g., `check(\"10.00\", \"DECIMAL(2,0)\")`). Others wouldn't fail, but can still enhance test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36545. This PR proposes to infer the map types from all pairs instead of the first pair.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have the consistent behaivor. e.g.,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[1], [2], [\"a\"], [\"c\"]]).collect()\r\n[Row(_1='1'), Row(_1='2'), Row(_1='a'), Row(_1='c')]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

\"A\"}}]).collect()\r\n[Row(outer={'name': None, 'payment': 200.5})]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With Spark Conenct:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([{\"outer\": {\"payment\": 200.5, \"name\": \"A\"}}]).collect()\r\n[Row(outer={'payment': '200.5', 'name': 'A'})]\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.pyspark.legacy.inferMapTypeFromFirstPair.enabled\", True)\r\n>>>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOn the Scala/Java side:\r\n- Rename `ErrorClassesJsonReader` to `ErrorConditionsJsonReader`.\r\n- Rename `subClass` to `subCondition` in `error-conditions.json` and also in some private classes like `ErrorInfo`.\r\n\r\nOn the Python side:\r\n- Rename `error_classes.py` to `error_conditions.py`.\r\n- Rename `ErrorClassesReader` to `ErrorConditionsReader`.\r\n- For `PySparkException` and `PySparkAssertionError`, add an `error_condition` parameter to the interface and deprecate the `error_class` parameter. (It would have been nice to be able to use `@warnings.deprecated()` for this, but that's not available [until Python 3.13][pydep].)\r\n\r\n[pydep]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0702/\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Review all mentions of SPARK-47429 in the codebase.\r\n- [ ] Confirm we want sub-conditions to be keyed in JSON as `sub_condition` in Python but `subCondition` in Scala.\r\n- [ ] Mark public interfaces that use \"error class\" as deprecated and redirect to new interfaces that use \"error condition\" instead.\r\n  - [ ] `ErrorConditionsJsonReader` methods like `getErrorMessage`, `isValidErrorClass`, etc.\r\n  - [ ] `SparkThrowable`\r\n  - [ ] `SparkThrowableHelper`\r\n  - [ ] `SparkException`\r\n  - [ ] `SparkThrowable` sub-classes like `SparkRuntimeException`, `SparkUpgradeException`, etc.\r\n  - [ ] `KafkaIllegalStateException`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings the code and interfaces in line with the updated terminology agreed on in SPARK-46810 and described in the [errors README][error-readme].\r\n\r\nDeprecating some of the `errorClass` / `error_class` parameters instead of renaming them in place is mainly so that we don't have to execute thousands of renames across the codebase all at once, and can instead do this incrementally.\r\n\r\n[error-readme]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9e386b472981979e368a5921c58da5bfefe3acfe/common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md?plain=1#L7-L36\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, some evolving and developer APIs are changing.\r\n\r\nThe public interfaces for Spark's error reporting are also changing, though in a backwards-compatible manner.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-12T20:55:46Z","updated_at":"2024-08-25T00:23:59Z","closed_at":"2024-08-25T00:23:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48230635c0507bd820b67e2e627f47bcc9059b52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

to `StringType` in `CharVarcharUtils.replaceCharVarcharWithStringInSchema` and record `__CHAR_VARCHAR_TYPE_STRING` in the metadata.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the above error is that the `StringType` columns in the `dataSchema` and `requiredSchema` of `UnivocityParser` are not consistent. The `StringType` in the `dataSchema` has metadata, while the metadata in the `requiredSchema` is empty. We need to retain the metadata when resolving schema.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new test case in `CSVSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-11T07:51:48Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T02:39:58Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T14:42:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f1ccbaa2da0b7ddac58adea244f3a1e547dd727","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/204a4ab9374e192baa80c90d704bd6aaba202891","head":{"label":"liujiayi771:csv-char","ref":"csv-char","sha":"204a4ab9374e192baa80c90d704bd6aaba202891","user":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88181374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODE4MTM3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"liujiayi771/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to replace `Local[..]` with `\"Local[...]\"` in the docs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.When I recently switched from `bash` to `zsh` and executed command `./bin/spark-shell --master local[8]` on local, the following error will be printed:\r\n<img width=\"570\" alt=\"image\"

tested?\r\nManually test\r\nWhether the user uses `bash` or `zsh`, the above `--master \"local[n]\"` can be executed successfully in the expected way.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add support for passing a PyArrow Table to `createDataFrame()`.\r\n- Document this on the **Apache Arrow in PySpark** user guide page.\r\n- Fix an issue with timestamp and struct columns in `toArrow()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis seems like a logical next step after the addition of a `toArrow()` DataFrame method in #45481.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers will have the ability to pass PyArrow Tables to `createDataFrame()`. There are no changes to the parameters of `createDataFrame()`. The only difference is that `data` can now be a PyArrow Table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMany tests were added, for Spark Classic and Spark Connect. I ran the tests locally with older versions of PyArrow installed (going back to 10.0).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `commons-lang:commons-lang:2.6` back to support legacy Hive UDF jars . This is a partial revert of SPARK-47018 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRecently, we dropped `commons-lang:commons-lang` during Hive upgrade.\r\n- #46468\r\n\r\nHowever, only Apache Hive 2.3.10 or 4.0.0 dropped it. In other words, Hive 2.0.0 ~ 2.3.9 and Hive 3.0.0 ~ 3.1.3 requires it. As a result, all existing  UDF jars built against those versions requires `commons-lang:commons-lang` still.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/4892\r\n\r\nFor example, Apache Hive 3.1.3 `GenericUDFTrim.java` code:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/af7059e2bdc8b18af42e0b7f7163b923a0bfd424/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDFTrim.java#L21\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/af7059e2bdc8b18af42e0b7f7163b923a0bfd424/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDFTrim.java#L42\r\n```\r\nreturn StringUtils.strip(val, \" \");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, Maven CIs are broken.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/9032639456/job/24825599546 (Maven / Java 17)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/9033374547/job/24835284769 (Maven / Java 21)\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the existing test UDF jar `hive-test-udfs.jar` was built from old Hive (before 2.3.10) libraries which requires `commons-lang:commons-lang:2.6`. \r\n```\r\nHiveUDFDynamicLoadSuite:\r\n- Spark should be able to run Hive UDF using jar regardless of current thread context classloader (UDF\r\n20:21:25.129 WARN org.apache.spark.SparkContext: The JAR file:///home/runner/work/spark/spark/sql/hive/src/test/noclasspath/hive-test-udfs.jar at spark://localhost:33327/jars/hive-test-udfs.jar has been added already.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-47353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47353)\r\n\r\n#### Pull requests\r\n\r\n[Scala TreeMap (RB Tree)](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46404)\r\n[GroupMapReduce](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46526) <- Most performant\r\n [Comparing Experimental Approaches ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46488)\r\n\r\n#### Central Change to Mode `eval` Algorithm:\r\n - Update to `eval` Method: The `eval` method now checks if the column being looked at is string with non-default collation and if so, uses a grouping \r\n ```\r\nbuff.toSeq.groupMapReduce {\r\n         case (key: String, _) =>\r\n           CollationFactory.getCollationKey(UTF8String.fromString(key), collationId)\r\n         case (key: UTF8String, _) =>\r\n           CollationFactory.getCollationKey(key, collationId)\r\n         case (key, _) => key\r\n       }(x => x)((x, y) => (x._1, x._2 + y._2)).values\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Minor Change to Mode:\r\n- Introduction of `collationId`: A new lazy value `collationId` is computed from the `dataType` of the `child` expression, used to fetch the appropriate collation comparator when `collationEnabled` is true.\r\n\r\n #### Unit Test Enhancements: Significant additions to `CollationStringExpressionsSuite` to test new functionality including:\r\n- Tests for the `Mode` function when handling strings with different collation settings.\r\n\r\n #### Benchmark Updates:\r\n- Enhanced the `CollationBenchmark` classes to include benchmarks for the new mode functionality with and without collation settings, as well as numerical types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Ensures consistency in handling string comparisons under various collation settings.\r\n2. Improves global usability by enabling compatibility with different collation standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces the following user-facing changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a new `collationEnabled` property to the `Mode` expression.\r\n2. Users can now specify collation settings for the `Mode` expression to customize its behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested through a combination of new and existing unit and end-to-end SQL tests.\r\n\r\n1. **Unit Tests:**\r\n   - **CollationStringExpressionsSuite:**\r\n     - WIP: Make the newly added tests more in the same design pattern as the existing tests\r\n    - Added multiple test cases to verify that the `Mode` function correctly handles strings with different collation settings.\r\n\r\nTests do not need to include Null Handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Benchmark Tests:**\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package \r\nexport SPARK_HOME=/Users/gideon/repos/spark\r\n$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell\r\n   spark.sqlContext.setConf(\"spark.sql.collation.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.functions\r\n    import spark.implicits._\r\n    val data = Seq((\"Def\"), (\"def\"), (\"DEF\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\"))\r\n    val df = data.toDF(\"word\")\r\n    val dfLC = df.withColumn(\"word\",\r\n      col(\"word\").cast(StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY_LCASE\")))\r\n    val dfLCA = dfLC.agg(org.apache.spark.sql.functions.mode(functions.col(\"word\")).as(\"count\"))\r\n    dfLCA.show()\r\n/*\r\nBEFORE:\r\n-----+\r\n|count|\r\n+-----+\r\n|  abc|\r\n+-----+\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n+-----+\r\n|count|\r\n+-----+\r\n|  Def|\r\n+-----+\r\n\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. **Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - The patch passed all relevant Continuous Integration (CI) checks, including:\r\n     - Unit test suite\r\n     - Benchmark suite [TODO RUN AND ATTACH RESULTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo, but the PR Description was co-authored with Chat-GPT.\r\n\r\n### What is left to do before taking off the WIP tag?\r\n \r\n\r\n- [x] Discuss/analyze performance in PR Description\r\n- [ ] Make sure benchmarks invoke the function enough times to have non-zero values in the benchmark results\r\n- [x] Run benchmarks in GHA and add resultant benchmark reports to Pull Request\r\n- [x] Make the newly added tests more in the same design pattern as the existing tests\r\n- [x] Make the newly added tests cover all collations\r\n- [x] Figure out within group return value (EG if lower case collation, between  Seq((\"Def\"), (\"def\"), (\"def\"), (\"DEF\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\")), is Def, DEF, or def the answer?\r\n- Choices are\r\n1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR disallows map keys from being of variant type. Therefore, SQL statements like `select map(parse_json('{\"a\": 1}'), 1)`, which would work earlier, will throw an exception now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAllowing variant to be the key type of a map can result in undefined behavior as this has not been tested.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users could use variants as keys in maps earlier. However, this PR disallows this possibility.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds AES-GCM as an optional AES cipher mode for RPC encryption. The current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior. See [SPARK-47172](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47172) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds an additional configuration flag is reflected in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests are all ensured to pass. New unit tests are written to explicitly test GCM support and to verify that modifying ciphertext content will cause an exception and fail.\r\n\r\n`build/sbt

The reason of the failure could be a pickle optimization. \r\nOn branch 3.5, there is a listener named \"TestListener\", but on 4.0, it was renamed to \"TestListenerSpark\". In the test, the listener should be serialized to the server. But on the 4.0 server, we see this error:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<frozen runpy>\", line 198, in _run_module_as_main\r\n  File \"<frozen runpy>\", line 88, in _run_code\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 115, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 73, in main\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/worker_util.py\", line 64, in read_command\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 173, in _read_with_length\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 473, in loads\r\nAttributeError: Can't get attribute 'TestListener' on <module 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.streaming.test_parity_listener' from '/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/streaming/test_parity_listener.py'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt cannot find the `TestListener` on 4.0 server. This indicates that the 4.0 server is trying to read that `TestListener` from it's local `<module 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.streaming.test_parity_listener' from '/home/runner/work/oss-spark/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/streaming/test_parity_listener.py'>` but `TestListener` is not there. If the TestListener is really serialized and streamed to the server to deserialize, the server should not throw this error. So it could be that pickle is trying to do some fast load, but I'm not really sure about this theory. But anyways an easy fix is to just rename the listener on 3.5.\r\n\r\nAlso cherry-picked https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4d9dbb35aacb6bd8ca1e5a6dff5076034b5a042b to remove the tables after testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString searching in UTF8_BINARY_LCASE now works on character-level, rather than on byte-level. For example: `contains(\"İ\", \"i\");` now returns **false**, because there exists no `start, len` such that `lowercase(substring(\"İ\", start, len)) == \"i\"`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix functions that give unusable results due to one-to-many case mapping when performing string search under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE (see example above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, behaviour of `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith`, and `locate`/`position` expressions is changed for edge cases with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRename `FIELDS_ALREADY_EXISTS` to `FIELD_ALREADY_EXISTS`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThough it's not meant to be a proper English sentence, `FIELDS_ALREADY_EXISTS` is grammatically incorrect. It should either be \"fields already exist[]\" or \"field[] already exists\". I opted for the latter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the name of an error condition.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNew lightweight exception for control-flow between UnivocityParser and FailureSafeParser to speed-up malformed CSV parsing.\r\n\r\nThis is a different way to implement these reverted changes: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46478\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation was more invasive - removing `cause` from `BadRecordException` could break upper code, which unwraps errors and checks the types of the causes. This implementation only touches `FailureSafeParser` and `UnivocityParser` since in the codebase they are always used together, unlike `JacksonParser` and `StaxXmlParser`. Removing stacktrace from `BadRecordException` is safe, since the cause itself has an adequate stacktrace (except pure control-flow cases).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nParsing in `PermissiveMode` is slow due to heavy exception construction (stacktrace filling + string template substitution in `SparkRuntimeException`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, since `FailureSafeParser` unwraps `BadRecordException` and correctly rethrows user-facing exceptions in `FailFastMode`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- `testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.csv.UnivocityParserSuite`\r\n- Manually run csv benchmark\r\n- Manually checked correct and malformed csv in sherk-shell (org.apache.spark.SparkException is thrown with the stacktrace)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

pushdown predicates.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLike #33958, to avoid performance regression caused by repeated evaluation of expensive expressions and larger plans such as case

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n1.migrate `error/warn/info` in module `common` with variables to `structured logging framework` for java side.\r\n2.convert all dependencies on `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` to `org.apache.spark.internal.Logger & org.apache.spark.internal.LoggerFactory`, in order to completely `prohibit` importing `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` in java code later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-09T02:54:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T04:04:15Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T04:04:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11a7931ad30a95eebbb3d831a161ce10b3cf00af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d1fe872eaa18fe55ea6e7cfc7fba0b55ad4386e","head":{"label":"panbingkun:common_java_sl","ref":"common_java_sl","sha":"6d1fe872eaa18fe55ea6e7cfc7fba0b55ad4386e","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip providing memory usage metrics from RocksDB if bounded memory usage is enabled\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this, we are providing memory usage that is the max usage per node at a partition level.\r\nFor eg - if we report this\r\n```\r\n    \"allRemovalsTimeMs\" : 93,\r\n    \"commitTimeMs\" : 32240,\r\n    \"memoryUsedBytes\" : 15956211724278,\r\n    \"numRowsDroppedByWatermark\" : 0,\r\n    \"numShufflePartitions\" : 200,\r\n    \"numStateStoreInstances\" : 200,\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have 200 partitions in this case.\r\nSo the memory usage per partition / state store would be ~78GB. However, this node has 256GB memory total and we have 2 such nodes. We have configured our cluster to use 30% of available memory on each node for RocksDB which is ~77GB. \r\nSo the memory being reported here is actually per node rather than per partition which could be confusing for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo - only a metrics reporting change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 10 seconds, 878 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 24\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 24, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-09T00:58:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T08:10:08Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T08:10:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa80301c0f626b96e3653701ba6f2aa564143cba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis introduces a new operator to approximate the frequency of unique combinations of column values. This is done inline so it dos not require significant code changes when debugging issues, like skew. I wrote this with joins in mind, but it is not limited to that.\r\n\r\nThe solution does not guarantee the top keys will be surfaced because it only maintains the top N keys to reduce the overhead. For most cases, this will be sufficient to find the skewed keys. If it doesn't then the new config `spark.sql.debug.maxInlineColumnCountKeys` can be increased to increase the keys maintained, which increases the chances of finding the top key frequencies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen skew is discovered, the natural next step is to determine what key is causing skew. Today, this requires you to write custom queries or refactor code to identify the hot key. After this change, someone can call `Dataset.inlineColumnsCount()` to count the key frequencies inline and publish the top results to an accumulator. This will result in much less code to identify skew issues, especially in complex transformations.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements I would like to make are:\r\n\r\n1. The same debug for other APIs (SQL hint, Python)\r\n2. A config only way to enable this. This will be a useful way to debug without needing a code change. I tried adding a config, plus an analyzer rule to automatically add the new operator to all joins, but it requires more consideration because when calling `Dataset.join` it calls the analyzer and assumes the analyzed plan has a join as the root.\r\n3. Extend the analyzer to infer the keys in more places, like exchanges.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This includes:\r\n1. A new operator to count the occurrence for a combination of column values that are written to an accumulator.\r\n2. It adds a debug method to use the new operator.\r\n4. A new config to control how many unique values are maintained while counting their frequencies.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.execution.debug._\r\n\r\nval a = spark.range(50)\r\nval b = spark.range(100).withColumn(\"id2\", when($\"id\" > 10, 10).otherwise($\"id\")).select($\"id2\")\r\n\r\nval c = a.join(b, $\"id\" === $\"id2\").inlineColumnsCount()\r\nc.collect\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what it looks like in the SHS UI. a's output:\r\n<img width=\"913\" alt=\"image\"

is the PR description for the alternative PR:\r\n\r\n---\r\n### PR Description\r\n\r\n#### Introduction\r\nThis PR proposes an alternative approach to the original implementation using `TreeMap` with a custom comparator for collation-sensitive grouping. The primary objective is to improve performance by leveraging `OpenHashMap` with a custom hashing strategy.\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark Results\r\nThe initial `TreeMap` approach led to significant performance degradation, especially for unicode collations. After implementing a proof of concept using `OpenHashMap`, the slowdown was reduced considerably.\r\n\r\n**Benchmark Results Overview**\r\n\r\n| Approach           | Slowdown (UTF8_BINARY Reference) |\r\n|--------------------|----------------------------------|\r\n| `TreeMap`          | 16.9x - 56x                      |\r\n| `OpenHashMap`      | 9.5x - 15x                       |\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n- **UTF8_BINARY (Baseline)**\r\n  - Red-Black Tree / TreeMap Implementation: Slowdown ranges from 16.9x to 56x\r\n  - `OpenHashMap` Implementation: Slowdown ranges from 9.5x to 15x\r\n- The numerical benchmark case has been ignored for this analysis.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Implementation\r\n- **Custom Hasher**: Introduced a custom `Hasher` to allow collation-sensitive grouping.\r\n  - Modified `org.apache.spark.util.collection.OpenHashSet.Hasher.hash()`, specifically an override of `hash()` within `Hasher[String with Collation]`.\r\n  - This new `Hasher` branches to an alternative hashing method that is collation-sensitive.\r\n- **Benchmark Enhancement**: Benchmarks now include multiple collation types and evaluate different algorithms.\r\n\r\n**Approach 3 (Prototype)**\r\nIn addition to `TreeMap` and `OpenHashMap`, a third approach has been introduced:\r\n```scala\r\nprivate def impl3(buff: OpenHashMap[AnyRef, Long]) = {\r\n  val modeMap = buff.toSeq.groupMapReduce {\r\n    case (key: String, _) =>\r\n      CollationFactory.getCollationKey(UTF8String.fromString(key), collationId)\r\n    case (key: UTF8String, _) =>\r\n      CollationFactory.getCollationKey(key, collationId)\r\n    case (key, _) => key\r\n  }(x => x)((x, y) => (x._1, x._2 + y._2)).values\r\n  modeMap\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Next Steps\r\n- **Cardinality and Duplicates**: Further analysis needed to determine expected cardinalities in realistic scenarios. For example, even in large datasets with 1 trillion rows, it's unlikely that all rows will have unique values.\r\n- **Benchmark Diversity**: More varied benchmarks needed, especially in the experimental branch, to better evaluate different algorithms with varied duplicate values.\r\n\r\n## OpenJDK Benchmark Results\r\n\r\n**Configuration**:  \r\n- **Java Version**: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 21.0.2+13-LTS  \r\n- **OS**: Mac OS X 14.4.1  \r\n- **CPU**: Apple M3 Max  \r\n\r\n### Collation Unit Benchmarks - Mode - 2000 Elements\r\n\r\n| Mode                         | Map Type  | Best Time

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt adds null checks when accessing a nested element when casting a nested type to variant. It is necessary because the `get` API doesn't guarantee to return null when the slot is null. For example, `ColumnarArray.get` may return the default value of a primitive type if the slot is null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is a bug fix is necessary for the cast-to-variant expression to work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTwo new unit tests. One directly uses `ColumnarArray` as the input of the cast. The other creates a real-world situation where `ColumnarArray` is the input of the cast (scan). Both of them would fail without the code change in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run `pyspark-pandas*` of `branch-3.4` only in PR builder and Daily Python CIs. In other words, only the commit builder will skip it by default. Please note that all PR builders is not consuming ASF resources and they provides lots of test coverage everyday.\r\n\r\n`branch-3.4` Python Daily CI runs all Python tests including `pyspark-pandas` like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/21548a8cc5c527d4416a276a852f967b4410bd4b/.github/workflows/build_branch34_python.yml#L43-L44\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce GitHub Action usage to meet ASF INFRA policy.\r\n- https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\n    > All workflows MUST have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 20. This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.\r\n\r\nAlthough `pandas` is an **optional** package in PySpark, this is essential for PySpark users and we have **6 test pipelines** which requires lots of resources. We need to optimize the job concurrently level to `less than or equal to 20` while keeping the test capability as much as possible.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/da0c7cc81bb3d69d381dd0683e910eae4c80e9ae/dev/requirements.txt#L4-L7\r\n\r\n- pyspark-pandas\r\n- pyspark-pandas-slow\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run `pyspark-pandas*` of `branch-3.5` only in PR builder and Daily Python CIs. In other words, only the commit builder will skip it by default. Please note that all PR builders is not consuming ASF resources and they provides lots of test coverage everyday.\r\n\r\n`branch-3.5` Python Daily CI runs all Python tests including `pyspark-pandas` like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/21548a8cc5c527d4416a276a852f967b4410bd4b/.github/workflows/build_branch35_python.yml#L43-L44\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce GitHub Action usage to meet ASF INFRA policy.\r\n- https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\n    > All workflows MUST have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 20. This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.\r\n\r\nAlthough `pandas` is an **optional** package in PySpark, this is essential for PySpark users and we have **6 test pipelines** which requires lots of resources. We need to optimize the job concurrently level to `less than or equal to 20` while keeping the test capability as much as possible.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a762f3175fcdb7b069faa0c2bfce93d295cb1f10/dev/requirements.txt#L4-L7\r\n\r\n- pyspark-pandas\r\n- pyspark-pandas-slow\r\n- pyspark-pandas-connect\r\n- pyspark-pandas-slow-connect\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRevert BadRecordException optimizations for UnivocityParser, StaxXmlParser and JacksonParser\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reduce the blast radius - this will be implemented differently. There were two PRs by me recently:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46438\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46400\r\n\r\nwhich introduced optimizations to speed-up control flow between UnivocityParser, StaxXmlParser and JacksonParser. However, these changes are quite unstable and may break any calling code, which relies on exception cause type, for example. Also, there may be some Spark plugins/extensions using that exception for user-facing errors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-08T17:18:03Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T07:35:34Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T07:35:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17b10b875e8ab8ccd7b06d66069b08ba731d3798","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6760fb5088b8a509f5a149417ba751a9c414cf3","head":{"label":"vladimirg-db:vladimirg-db/revert-SPARK-48169-SPARK-48143","ref":"vladimirg-db/revert-SPARK-48169-SPARK-48143","sha":"a6760fb5088b8a509f5a149417ba751a9c414cf3","user":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"70e5d2aa7a992a6f4ff9c7d8e3752ce1d3d488f2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`ExpressionBuilder` asserts all its input expressions to be resolved during lookup, which is not true as the analyzer rule `ResolveFunctions` can trigger function lookup even if the input expression contains unresolved lambda functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates that assert to check non-lambda inputs only, and fail earlier if the input contains lambda functions. In the future, if we use `ExpressionBuilder` to register higher-order functions, we can relax it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter error message\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only changes error message\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBlock of syntax CAST(value AS STRING COLLATE collation_name).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent state of code allows for calls like CAST(1 AS STRING COLLATE UNICODE). We want to restrict CAST expression to only be able to cast to default collation string, and to only allow COLLATE expression to produce explicitly collated strings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest in CollationSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe must consistently use normalized plans for cache filling and lookup, or inconsistency will lead to cache misses.\r\n\r\nTo guarantee this, this PR makes `CacheManager` the central place to do plan normalization, so that callers don't need to care about it. Now most APIs in `CacheManager` take either `Dataset` or `LogicalPlan`. For `Dataset`, we get the normalized plan directly. For `LogicalPlan`, we normalize it before further use.\r\n\r\nThe caller side should pass `Dataset` when invoking `CacheManager`, if it already creates `Dataset`. This is to reduce the impact, as extra creation of `Dataset` may have perf issues or introduce unexpected analysis exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary cache misses for users who add custom normalization rules\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, perf only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix SortShuffleWriter lacks shuffle write related metrics resulting in potentially inaccurate data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the shuffle writer is SortShuffleWriter, it does not use SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter to update metrics, which causes AQE to obtain runtime statistics and the rowCount obtained is 0.\r\n\r\nSome optimization rules rely on rowCount statistics, such as `EliminateLimits`. Because rowCount is 0, it removes the limit operator. At this time, we get data results without limit.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/ShuffleExchangeExec.scala#L168-L172\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L2067-L2070\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix SortShuffleWriter lacks shuffle write related metrics resulting in potentially inaccurate data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the shuffle writer is SortShuffleWriter, it does not use SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter to update metrics, which causes AQE to obtain runtime statistics and the rowCount obtained is 0.\r\n\r\nSome optimization rules rely on rowCount statistics, such as `EliminateLimits`. Because rowCount is 0, it removes the limit operator. At this time, we get data results without limit.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/ShuffleExchangeExec.scala#L168-L172\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/59d5946cfd377e9203ccf572deb34f87fab7510c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L2067-L2070\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAddition of an abstract MapType (similar to abstract ArrayType in sql internal types) which accepts `StringTypeCollated` as `keyType` & `valueType`. Apart from extending this interface for all Spark functions, this PR also introduces collation awareness for json expression: schema_of_json.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed in order to enable collation support for functions that use collated maps.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users should now be able to use collated strings within arguments for json function: schema_of_json.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nE2e sql tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
