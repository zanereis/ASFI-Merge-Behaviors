PR covers point (2) and point (5) from KAFKA-5036:\r\n\r\n**Commit 1:** \r\n2. Currently, we update the leader epoch in epochCache after log append in the follower but before log append in the leader. It would be more consistent to always do this after log append. This also avoids issues related to failure in log append.\r\n5. The constructor of LeaderEpochFileCache has the following:\r\nlock synchronized { ListBuffer(checkpoint.read(): _*) }\r\nBut everywhere else uses a read or write lock. We should use consistent locking.\r\nThis is a refactor to the way epochs are cached, replacing the code to cache the latest epoch in the LeaderEpochFileCache by reusing the cached value in Partition. There is no functional change.\r\n\r\n**Commit 2:**\r\nAdds an assert(epoch >=0) as epochs are written. Refactors tests so they never hit this assert. \r\n\r\n

goal of this ticket is to improve controller maintainability by simplifying the controller's concurrency semantics. The controller code has a lot of shared state between several threads using several concurrency primitives. This makes the code hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nThis ticket proposes we convert the controller to a single-threaded event queue model. We add a new controller thread which processes events held in an event queue. Note that this does not mean we get rid of all threads used by the controller. We merely delegate all work that interacts with controller local state to this single thread. With only a single thread accessing and modifying the controller local state, we no longer need to worry about concurrent access, which means we can get rid of the various concurrency primitives used throughout the controller.\r\n\r\nPerformance is expected to match existing behavior since the bulk of the existing controller work today already happens sequentially in the ZkClient’s single

PR replaces https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2743 (just raising from Confluent repo)\r\n\r\nThis PR describes the addition of Partition Level Leader Epochs to messages in Kafka as a mechanism for fixing some known issues in the replication protocol. Full details can be found here:\r\n\r\n[KIP-101 Reference](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-101+-+Alter+Replication+Protocol+to+use+Leader+Epoch+rather+than+High+Watermark+for+Truncation)\r\n\r\n*The key elements are*:\r\n- Epochs are stamped on messages as they enter the leader.\r\n- Epochs are tracked in both leader and follower in a new checkpoint file. \r\n- A new API allows followers to retrieve the leader's latest offset for a particular epoch. \r\n- The logic for truncating the log, when a replica becomes a follower, has been moved from Partition into the ReplicaFetcherThread\r\n- When partitions are added to the ReplicaFetcherThread they are added in an initialising state. Initialising partitions request leader epochs and then truncate their logs appropriately. \r\n\r\nThis test provides a good overview of the workflow `EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.shouldFollowLeaderEpochBasicWorkflow()`\r\n\r\nThe corrupted log use case is covered by the test

\r\n> Currently SchemaBuilder is strict when checking that certain fields have not been set yet (e.g. version, name, doc). It just checks that the field is null. This is intended to protect the user from buggy code that overwrites a field with different values, but it's a bit too strict currently. In generic code for converting schemas (e.g. Converters) you will sometimes initialize a builder with these values (e.g. because you get a SchemaBuilder for a logical type, which sets name & version),

deadlock scenario found during local test run: The main thread was waiting for the coordinator lock. The thread performing close() was holding the coordinator lock and polling to find coordinator. The test expected close() to timeout, but for timing out, the main thread had to update time, which it couldn't since it was waiting for the lock. This fix avoids using coordinator in the main thread during the close task.","created_at":"2017-04-03T10:32:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T11:59:03Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T11:59:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3f2d0d2e4c6953bdc15b4f307c8dfdbfa13830e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/2792/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/2792/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2792/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/37eb3d16f31edb2c47cb063cfc216e205075de0f","head":{"label":"rajinisivaram:MINOR-closetest-deadlock","ref":"MINOR-closetest-deadlock","sha":"37eb3d16f31edb2c47cb063cfc216e205075de0f","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42296329,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjI5NjMyOQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"rajinisivaram/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram/kafka","description":"Mirror

deadlock.\r\n\r\nFixed this by softer locking on the state change, that guarantees atomic changes to the state but does not lock on the whole object (I at least could not find another method that would require more than atomicly-locked access except for `setState`).\r\nAlso qualified the state listeners with their outer-class to make the whole code-flow around this more readable (having two interfaces with the same naming for interface and method and then using them between their two outer classes is crazy hard to get imo :)).\r\n\r\nEasy to reproduced yourself by running `org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreamsTest` in a loop for a bit (save yourself some time by running 2-4 in parallel :)). Eventually it will lock on one of the tests (for me this takes less than 1 min with 4 parallel

Currently SchemaBuilder is strict when checking that certain fields have not been set yet (e.g. version, name, doc). It just checks that the field is null. This is intended to protect the user from buggy code that overwrites a field with different values, but it's a bit too strict currently. In generic code for converting schemas (e.g. Converters) you will sometimes initialize a builder with these values (e.g. because you get a SchemaBuilder for a logical type, which sets name & version), but then have generic code for setting name & version from the source schema.\r\n\r\nChanged the validation method to not only check if a field is null but also to check if the new value that is being set is the same as the current value of the field.\r\n\r\n@ewencp

looking into instabilities like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4692 I noticed that we are running one JVM fork per core in the ITs.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me could be contributing to the instability of some ITs a lot. Turning down the number of forks to half the cores, the IT suits speed up measurably for me (example streams goes from ~4 minutes to 2.5 minutes).\r\nAlso, case in point this is what 4 forks look like on an i7 (that would get 8 forks in trunk):\r\n\r\n![4forks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6490959/24557893/a7afa746-1639-11e7-94ff-6327695cf108.png)\r\n\r\nEffectively there's still load on all 8 cores at 4 forks (which is expected looking at the fact that most ITs have 2 or more I/O threads).\r\n\r\n=> imo it's a good idea to turn this down to half the cores. Let's see how Jenkins behaves with this in terms of the build times

Fixes race condition in TestVerifiableProducer sanity test:\r\nThe test starts a producer, waits for at least 5 acks, and then\r\nlogs in to the worker to grep for the producer process to figure\r\nout what version it is running.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the producer was set up to produce 1000 messages\r\nat a rate of 1000 msgs/s and then exit.

should be resolved by this.\r\n\r\nThe problem here (or at least one problem, causing trouble) appears to have been that the `testNo` field is not thread-safe the way it is used here (`volatile` doesn't help anything really) to generate a unique test number (for creating non-conflicting topic names).\r\nIf two instances of this class are set up inside the same fork and `testNo++;` is run in one just as the other runs e.g. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private void createTopics() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        streamOneInput = \"stream-one-\" + testNo;\r\n        outputTopic = \"output-\" + testNo;\r\n        CLUSTER.createTopic(streamOneInput, 3, 1);\r\n        CLUSTER.createTopic(outputTopic);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen both will have the same value for the topic names while sharing the same static `CLUSTER` field too.\r\nI fixed this by simply making the actually used `testNo` an instance variable that is derived from an increasing static counter for each test in an atomic way. I think this should resolve any naming collisions

We turn on SSL for interbroker communication).\r\n\r\nAs per the \"Concurrency Notes\" section from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLEngine.html:\r\n> two threads must not attempt to call the same method (either wrap() or unwrap()) concurrently\r\n\r\nSSLEngine.wrap gets called in:\r\n* SslTransportLayer.write\r\n* SslTransportLayer.handshake\r\n* SslTransportLayer.close\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the ZkEventThread and RequestSendThread can concurrently call SSLEngine.wrap:\r\n* ZkEventThread calls SslTransportLayer.close from ControllerChannelManager.removeExistingBroker\r\n* RequestSendThread can call SslTransportLayer.write or SslTransportLayer.handshake from NetworkClient.poll\r\n\r\nSuppose the controller moves for whatever reason. The former controller could have had a RequestSendThread who was in the middle of sending out messages to the cluster while the ZkEventThread began executing KafkaController.onControllerResignation, which calls ControllerChannelManager.shutdown, which sequentially cleans up the controller-to-broker queue and connection for every broker in the cluster. This cleanup includes the call to ControllerChannelManager.removeExistingBroker as mentioned earlier, causing the concurrent call to SSLEngine.wrap. This concurrent call throws a BufferOverflowException which ControllerChannelManager.removeExistingBroker catches so the ControllerChannelManager.shutdown moves onto cleaning up the next controller-to-broker queue and connection, skipping the cleanup steps such as clearing the queue, stopping the RequestSendThread, and removing the entry from its brokerStateInfo map.\r\n\r\nBy failing out of the Selector.close, the sensors corresponding to the broker connection has not been cleaned up. Any later attempt at initializing an identical Selector will result in a sensor collision and therefore cause Selector initialization to throw an exception. In other words, any later attempts by this broker to become controller again will fail on initialization. When controller initialization fails, the controller deletes the /controller znode and lets another broker take over.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the controller moves enough times such that every broker hits the BufferOverflowException concurrency issue. We're now guaranteed to fail controller initialization due to the sensor collision on every controller transition, so the controller will move across brokers continuously.\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids the concurrent use of non-threadsafe classes in ControllerChannelManager.removeExistingBroker by shutting down the RequestSendThread before closing the NetworkClient.","created_at":"2017-03-27T22:05:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T00:20:19Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T22:54:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71b1ff5ee66de11996ce0bb5914443d57f433199","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/2746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/2746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/11c828bcce89e5e640cf470b7d9bdfea0fe40b70","head":{"label":"onurkaraman:KAFKA-4959","ref":"KAFKA-4959","sha":"11c828bcce89e5e640cf470b7d9bdfea0fe40b70","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39984426,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTk4NDQyNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"onurkaraman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR describes the addition of Partition Level Leader Epochs to messages in Kafka as a mechanism for fixing some known issues in the replication protocol. Full details can be found here:\r\n\r\n[KIP-101 Reference](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-101+-+Alter+Replication+Protocol+to+use+Leader+Epoch+rather+than+High+Watermark+for+Truncation)\r\n\r\n*The key elements are*:\r\n- Epochs are stamped on messages as they enter the leader.\r\n- Epochs are tracked in both leader and follower in a new checkpoint file. \r\n- A new API allows followers to retrieve the leader's latest offset for a particular epoch. \r\n- The logic for truncating the log, when a replica becomes a follower, has been moved from Partition into the ReplicaFetcherThread\r\n- When partitions are added to the ReplicaFetcherThread they are added in an initialising state. Initialising partitions request leader epochs and then truncate their logs appropriately. \r\n\r\nThis test provides a good overview of the workflow `EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.shouldFollowLeaderEpochBasicWorkflow()`\r\n\r\nThe corrupted log use case is covered by the test  \r\n`EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.offsetsShouldNotGoBackwards()`\r\n\r\nRemaining work: The test `EpochDrivenReplicationProtocolAcceptanceTest.shouldSurviveFastLeaderChange()` doesn't correctly reproduce the underlying issue. This will be altered later to properly support this use case.
