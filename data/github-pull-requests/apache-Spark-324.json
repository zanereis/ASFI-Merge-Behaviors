What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor large trigger intervals (e.g. 10 minutes), if a batch takes 11 minutes, then it will wait for 9 mins before starting the next batch. This does not make sense. The processing time based trigger policy should be to do process batches as fast as possible, but no faster than 1 in every trigger interval. If batches are taking longer than trigger interval anyways, then no point waiting extra trigger interval.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I modified the ProcessingTimeExecutor to do so. Another minor change I did was to extract our StreamManualClock into a separate class so that it can be used outside subclasses of StreamTest. For example, ProcessingTimeExecutorSuite does not need to create any context for testing, just needs the StreamManualClock.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests to comprehensively test this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up of enabling test cases in DDLSuite with Hive Metastore. It consists of the following remaining tasks:\r\n- Run all the `alter table` and `drop table` DDL tests against data source tables when using Hive metastore. \r\n- Do not run any `alter table` and `drop table` DDL test against Hive serde tables when using InMemoryCatalog.\r\n- Reenable `alter table: set serde partition` and `alter table: set serde` tests for Hive serde tables.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis commit moves two rules right next to the rule OptimizeSubqueries.\r\n\r\n1. PullupCorrelatedPredicates: the rewrite of [Not] Exists and [Not] In (ListQuery) to PredicateSubquery\r\n2. RewritePredicateSubquery: the rewrite of PredicateSubquery to LeftSemi/LeftAnti\r\n  \r\nWith this change, [Not] Exists/In subquery is now rewritten to LeftSemi/LeftAnti at the beginning of Optimizer. \r\nOne Todo is to merge the two-stage rewrite in rule PullupCorrelatedPredicates and rule RewritePredicateSubquery into a single stage rewrite rule.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests with test cases in SQLQueryTestSuite under the directory ./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs/subquery.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nObserved by @felixcheung , in `SparkSession`.`Catalog` APIs, we have different conventions/rules for table/function identifiers/names. Most APIs accept the qualified name (i.e., `databaseName`.`tableName` or `databaseName`.`functionName`). However, the following five APIs do not accept it.  \r\n- def listColumns(tableName: String): Dataset[Column]\r\n- def getTable(tableName: String): Table \r\n- def getFunction(functionName: String): Function\r\n- def tableExists(tableName: String): Boolean\r\n- def functionExists(functionName: String): Boolean\r\n\r\nTo make them consistent with the other Catalog APIs, this PR does the changes, updates the function/API comments and adds the `@params` to clarify the inputs we allow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the test cases

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems there are several non-breaking spaces were inserted into several `.md`s and they look breaking rendering markdown files.\r\n\r\nThese are different. For example, this can be checked via `python` as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> \" \"\r\n'\\xc2\\xa0'\r\n>>> \" \"\r\n' '\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note that it seems this PR description automatically replaces non-breaking spaces into normal spaces. Please open a `vi` and copy and paste it into `python` to verify this (do not copy the characters here)._\r\n\r\nI checked the output below in  Sapari and Chrome on Mac OS and, Internal Explorer on Windows 10.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n![2017-04-03 12 37 17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6477701/24594655/50aaba02-186a-11e7-80bb-d34b17a3398a.png)\r\n![2017-04-03 12 36 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6477701/24594654/50a855e6-186a-11e7-94e2-661e56544b0f.png)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n![2017-04-03 12 36 46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6477701/24594657/53c2545c-186a-11e7-9a73-00529afbfd75.png)\r\n![2017-04-03 12 36 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6477701/24594658/53c286c0-186a-11e7-99c9-e66b1f510fe7.png)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese instances were found via \r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep --include=*.scala --include=*.python --include=*.java --include=*.r --include=*.R --include=*.md --include=*.r -r -I \" \" .\r\n```\r\n\r\nin Mac OS.\r\n\r\nIt seems there are several instances more as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   ├── ...\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   │\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   ├── country=US\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   │   └── data.parquet\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   ├── country=CN\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   │   └── data.parquet\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:        │   └── ...\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            ├── ...\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            │\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            ├── country=US\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            │   └── data.parquet\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            ├── country=CN\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            │   └── data.parquet\r\n./docs/sql-programming-guide.md:            └── ...\r\n./sql/core/src/test/README.md:│   ├── *.avdl                  # Testing Avro IDL(s)\r\n./sql/core/src/test/README.md:│   └── *.avpr                  # !!

They do not look causing any problem for rendering within code blocks and I did not fix it to reduce the overhead to manually replace it when it is overwritten via `tree` command in the future.","created_at":"2017-04-03T03:44:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:31Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T09:11:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0dc504b4b2482378986d2236b964792088687dfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b0e56a590a9a73e26e6c5c2cff2a20942fdb908","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:non-breaking-space","ref":"non-breaking-space","sha":"4b0e56a590a9a73e26e6c5c2cff2a20942fdb908","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch implements `listPartitionsByFilter()` for `InMemoryCatalog` and thus resolves an outstanding TODO causing the `PruneFileSourcePartitions` optimizer rule not to apply when \"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\" is set to \"in-memory\" (which is the default).\r\n\r\nThe change is straightforward: it extracts the code for further filtering of the list of partitions returned by the metastore's `getPartitionsByFilter()` out from `HiveExternalCatalog` into `ExternalCatalogUtils` and calls this new function from `InMemoryCatalog` on the whole list of partitions.\r\n\r\nNow that this method is implemented we can always pass the `CatalogTable` to the `DataSource` in `FindDataSourceTable`, so that the latter is resolved to a relation with a `CatalogFileIndex`, which is what the `PruneFileSourcePartitions` rule matches for.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan existing tests and added new test for `listPartitionsByFilter` in `ExternalCatalogSuite`, which is subclassed by both `InMemoryCatalogSuite` and `HiveExternalCatalogSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-02T14:43:15Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T16:00:13Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T15:51:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ab14fae3c139898f7b0027d52dc1dccd67e70f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6bdcf480cbd1a4e3dff51bdd299e8eea6f4306d","head":{"label":"adrian-ionescu:InMemoryCatalog","ref":"InMemoryCatalog","sha":"d6bdcf480cbd1a4e3dff51bdd299e8eea6f4306d","user":{"login":"adrian-ionescu","id":16205848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16205848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86986142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Njk4NjE0Mg==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"adrian-ionescu/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adrian-ionescu","id":16205848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16205848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-ionescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-ionescu/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

Launch spark-shell, configured to bind to port 4040 => observed successful bind to 4040\r\n2. Launch spark-shell again, same config => WARN log & stack trace appear similar to Jira description, and port successfully binds to 4041.\r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n\r\nRepeat 1. and 2. above => No

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current Spark's HistoryServer we expected to get `AccessControlException` during listing all the files, but unfortunately it was not worked because we actually doesn't check the access permission and no other calls will throw such exception. What was worse is that this check will be deferred until reading files, which is not necessary and quite verbose, since it will be printed out the exception in every 10 seconds when checking the files.\r\n\r\nSo here with this fix, we actually check the read permission during listing the files, which could avoid unnecessary file read later on and suppress the verbose log.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit test to verify.","created_at":"2017-03-31T09:47:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T23:05:14Z","closed_at":"2017-04-20T23:05:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"625d8b6b298f1f491a9e235807faf76d4df20e69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b36fa75e4b2414d3df9bf6921cccc081147176e4","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-20172","ref":"SPARK-20172","sha":"b36fa75e4b2414d3df9bf6921cccc081147176e4","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `XXX` format instead of `ZZ`. `ZZ` seems a `FastDateFormat` specific.\r\n\r\n`ZZ` supports \"ISO 8601 extended format time zones\" but it seems `FastDateFormat` specific option. \r\nI misunderstood this is compatible format with `SimpleDateFormat` when this change is introduced.\r\nPlease see [SimpleDateFormat documentation]( https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html#iso8601timezone) and [FastDateFormat documentation](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/FastDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nIt seems we better replace `ZZ` to `XXX` because they look using the same strategy - [FastDateParser.java#L930](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/8767cd4f1a6af07093c1e6c422dae8e574be7e5e/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/FastDateParser.java#L930), [FastDateParser.java#L932-L951 ](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/8767cd4f1a6af07093c1e6c422dae8e574be7e5e/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/FastDateParser.java#L932-L951) and [FastDateParser.java#L596-L601](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/8767cd4f1a6af07093c1e6c422dae8e574be7e5e/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/FastDateParser.java#L596-L601). \r\n\r\nI also checked the codes and manually debugged it for sure. It seems both cases use the same pattern `( Z|(?:[+-]\\\\d{2}(?::)\\\\d{2}))`.\r\n\r\n_Note that this should be rather a fix about documentation and not the behaviour change because `ZZ` seems invalid date format in `SimpleDateFormat` as documented in `DataFrameReader` and etc, and both `ZZ` and `XXX` look identically working with `FastDateFormat`_\r\n\r\nCurrent documentation is as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   * <li>`timestampFormat` (default `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ`): sets the string that\r\n   * indicates a timestamp format. Custom date formats follow the formats at\r\n   * `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`. This applies to timestamp type.</li>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this. Also, manually tested as below (BTW, I don't think these are worth being added as tests within Spark):\r\n\r\n**Parse**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Encoder's deserializer must be resolved at the driver where the class is defined. Otherwise there are corner cases using nested classes where resolving at the executor can fail.\r\n\r\n- Fixed flaky test related to processing time timeout. The flakiness is caused because the test thread (that adds data to memory source) has a race condition with the streaming query thread. When testing the manual clock, the goal is to add data and increment clock together atomically, such that a trigger sees new data AND updated clock simultaneously (both or none). This fix adds additional synchronization in when adding data; it makes sure that the streaming query thread is waiting on the manual clock to be incremented (so no batch is currently running) before adding data.\r\n\r\n- Added`testQuietly` on some tests that generate a lot of error logs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nMultiple runs on existing unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-30T23:35:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T17:57:54Z","closed_at":"2017-03-31T17:57:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d68b5e549ea2c570a3a5b8447270e0a3f2e786f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4c5f6bc2446413cdd797b24c18895821ac3d19b","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-20165","ref":"SPARK-20165","sha":"e4c5f6bc2446413cdd797b24c18895821ac3d19b","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the scheduler does not kill the running tasks in a stage when it encounters fetch failure, as a result, we might end up running many duplicate tasks in the cluster. There is already a TODO in TaskSetManager to kill all running tasks which has not been implemented.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`ParquetConversions` and `OrcConversions` should be treated as regular `Analyzer` rules. It is not reasonable to be part of `HiveSessionCatalog`. This PR also combines two rules `ParquetConversions` and `OrcConversions` to build a new rule `RelationConversions `.\r\n\r\nAfter moving these two rules out of HiveSessionCatalog, the next step is to clean up, rename and move `HiveMetastoreCatalog` because it is not related to the hive package any more.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to run Spark unidoc to test Javadoc 8 build as Javadoc 8 is easily re-breakable.\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with it:\r\n\r\n- It introduces little extra bit of time to run the tests. In my case, it took 1.5 mins more (`Elapsed :[94.8746569157]`). How it was tested is described in \"How was this patch tested?\".\r\n\r\n- > One problem that I noticed was that Unidoc appeared to be processing test sources: if we can find a way to exclude those from being processed in the first place then that might significantly speed things up.\r\n\r\n  (see  @joshrosen's [comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18692?focusedCommentId=15947627&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15947627))\r\n\r\nTo complete this automated build, It also suggests to fix existing Javadoc breaks / ones introduced by test codes as described above.\r\n\r\nThere fixes are similar instances that previously fixed. Please refer https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15999 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16013\r\n\r\nNote that this only fixes **errors** not **warnings**. Please see my observation https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17389#issuecomment-288438704 for spurious errors by warnings.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually via `jekyll build` for building tests. Also, tested via running `./dev/run-tests`. \r\n\r\nThis was tested via manually adding `time.time()` as below:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     profiles_and_goals = build_profiles + sbt_goals\r\n\r\n     print(\"[info] Building Spark unidoc (w/Hive 1.2.1) using SBT with these arguments: \",\r\n           \" \".join(profiles_and_goals))\r\n\r\n+    import time\r\n+    st = time.time()\r\n     exec_sbt(profiles_and_goals)\r\n+    print(\"Elapsed :[%s]\" % str(time.time() - st))\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduces\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n========================================================================\r\nBuilding Unidoc API Documentation\r\n========================================================================\r\n...\r\n[info] Main Java API documentation successful.\r\n...\r\nElapsed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd docstrings to column.py for the Column functions `rlike`, `like`, `startswith`, and `endswith`.

I put them immediately above the Column class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran `make html` on my local computer to remake the documentation, and verified that the html pages were displaying the docstrings correctly. I tried running `dev-tests`, and the formatting tests passed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe pull requests proposes to remove the hardcoded values for Amazon Kinesis - MIN_RETRY_WAIT_TIME_MS, MAX_RETRIES.\r\n\r\nThis change is critical for kinesis checkpoint recovery when the kinesis backed rdd is huge.\r\nFollowing happens in a typical kinesis recovery :\r\n- kinesis throttles large number of requests while recovering\r\n- retries in case of throttling are not able to recover due to the small wait period\r\n- kinesis throttles per second, the wait period should be configurable for recovery\r\n\r\nThe patch picks the spark kinesis configs from:\r\n- spark.streaming.kinesis.retry.wait.time\r\n- spark.streaming.kinesis.retry.max.attempts\r\n\r\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20140\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified the KinesisBackedBlockRDDSuite.scala to run kinesis tests with the modified configurations. Wasn't able to test the patch with actual throttling.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-29T12:22:33Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T22:51:14Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T22:11:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b96c1ec47cb2017a758e3ab180ad20786bf0b69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91a777c48e3794365b287015775d7554aa0ceff1","head":{"label":"yssharma:ysharma/spark-kinesis-retries","ref":"ysharma/spark-kinesis-retries","sha":"91a777c48e3794365b287015775d7554aa0ceff1","user":{"login":"yssharma","id":2063917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjM5MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2063917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma","html_url":"https://github.com/yssharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86563078,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjU2MzA3OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yssharma/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yssharma","id":2063917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjM5MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2063917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma","html_url":"https://github.com/yssharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yssharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yssharma/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we use KafkaDirectStream(Kafka0.10) with `enable.auto.commit` is `false`, \r\nsome record's offsets do not commit to Kafka at graceful shutdown, such below.\r\n\r\nSample code\r\n\r\n```\r\nval kafkaParams = Map[String, Object](\"enable.auto.commit\" -> \"false\")\r\nval kafkaStream = KafkaUtils.createDirectStream[String, String](ssc, ... , kafkaParams.asScala)\r\n\r\nkafkaStream.map { input =>\r\n  \"key: \" + input.key.toString + \" value: \" + input.value.toString + \" offset: \" + input.offset.toString\r\n  }.foreachRDD { rdd =>\r\n    rdd.foreach { input =>\r\n    println(input)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nkafkaStream.foreachRDD { rdd =>\r\n  val offsetRanges = rdd.asInstanceOf[HasOffsetRanges].offsetRanges\r\n  kafkaStream.asInstanceOf[CanCommitOffsets].commitAsync(offsetRanges)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput at first time\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey: null value: 1 offset: 101452472\r\nkey: null value: 2 offset: 101452473\r\nkey: null value: 3 offset: 101452474\r\nkey: null value: 4 offset: 101452475\r\nkey: null value: 5 offset: 101452476\r\nkey: null value: 6 offset: 101452477\r\nkey: null value: 7 offset: 101452478\r\nkey: null value: 8 offset: 101452479\r\nkey: null value: 9 offset: 101452480  // this is a last record before shutdown Spark Streaming gracefully\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput at second time\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey: null value: 7 offset: 101452478   // duplicate\r\nkey: null value: 8 offset: 101452479   // duplicate\r\nkey: null value: 9 offset: 101452480   // duplicate\r\nkey: null value: 10 offset: 101452481\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because offset will commit at the beginning of each batches, and will not commit after all batches processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests `offset commit when graceful shtudown` in `DirectKafkaStreamSuite.scala`","created_at":"2017-03-28T22:36:03Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T10:40:23Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T12:15:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42c61913656c35b8b557922c79d9828a273a6a53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0687565ab404878e1112d670bbf94a396b0ad40","head":{"label":"sasakitoa:Kafka010commitAsync2","ref":"Kafka010commitAsync2","sha":"c0687565ab404878e1112d670bbf94a396b0ad40","user":{"login":"sasakitoa","id":9620266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjAyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9620266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa","html_url":"https://github.com/sasakitoa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27533954,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzUzMzk1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sasakitoa/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sasakitoa","id":9620266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjAyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9620266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa","html_url":"https://github.com/sasakitoa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sasakitoa/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR propose the possibility to re-use a previous LDA as a starting point for the online optimizer, for incremental learning.\r\n- I add an `initialModel` parameter at mllib level, that is used to initialize the alpha and lambda (doc concentration, topic matrix) of the OnlineLDAOptimizer, instead of random.\r\n- It's only supported for online optimizer, any use with em optimizer will throw\r\n- Consistency of LDA parameters are checked between models (same k, vocab size...)\r\n- At ml API level, initialModel can be provided as a path to a serialized trained model (it's a path, and not a LDAModel object, to better fit in Params api)\r\n- I reflected the change at ml API level, python API, java API\r\n- I added a mention of that in docs\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests: mllib, ml, java api, python api\r\nManual tests: see added example \"LDAIncrementalExample.scala\"\r\n\r\nNB: This is my first contribution, please apologize is I miss something in PR process, or Spark standards.","created_at":"2017-03-28T20:14:03Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T14:53:14Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T14:53:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a2f49d039f78e22533ed777b310e2d7bf6b9b81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31cd11b94c751c42347e1c0e5a2cb707d1cd907c","head":{"label":"mdespriee:SPARK-20082_LDA_online_learning","ref":"SPARK-20082_LDA_online_learning","sha":"31cd11b94c751c42347e1c0e5a2cb707d1cd907c","user":{"login":"mdespriee","id":1590580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1590580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee","html_url":"https://github.com/mdespriee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86188302,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjE4ODMwMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"mdespriee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mdespriee","id":1590580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1590580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee","html_url":"https://github.com/mdespriee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdespriee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mdespriee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- ~~I added the method `toBlockMatrixDense` to the IndexedRowMatrix class. The current implementation of `toBlockMatrix` is insufficient for users with relatively dense IndexedRowMatrix objects, since it assumes sparsity.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ended up deciding that there should be just a single `toBlockMatrix` method, which creates a BlockMatrix whose blocks may be dense or sparse depending on the sparsity of the rows. This method will work better on any current use case of `toBlockMatrix` and doesn't go through `CoordinateMatrix` like the old method. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n~~I used the same tests already written for `toBlockMatrix()` to test this method. I also added a new additional unit test for an edge case that was not adequately tested by current test suite.~~\r\n\r\nI ran the original `IndexedRowMatrix` tests, plus wrote more to better handle edge cases ignored by original tests.

Ideally this should be fine, as `scala.collection.immutable.Map` extends `scala.collect.Map`, but our `ObjectType` is too strict about this, this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`FalseLiteral` and `TrueLiteral` should have been eliminated by optimizer rule `BooleanSimplification`, but null literals might be added by optimizer rule `NullPropagation`. For safety, our filter estimation should handle all the eligible literal cases.\r\n\r\nOur optimizer rule BooleanSimplification is unable to remove the null literal in many cases. For example, `a < 0 or null`. Thus, we need to handle null literal in filter estimation.\r\n\r\n`Not` can be pushed down below `And` and `Or`. Then, we could see two consecutive `Not`, which need to be collapsed into one. Because of the limited expression support for filter estimation, we just need to handle the case `Not(null)` for avoiding incorrect error due to the boolean operation on null.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Spark’s DAGScheduler currently does not recompute all the lost shuffle blocks on a host when a FetchFailed exception occurs, while fetching shuffle blocks from another executor with external shuffle service enabled. Instead it only recomputes the lost shuffle blocks computed by the executor for which the FetchFailed exception occurred. This works fine for Internal shuffle scenario, where the executors serve their own shuffle blocks and hence only the shuffle blocks for that executor should be considered lost. However, when External Shuffle Service is being used, a FetchFailed exception would mean that the external shuffle service running on that host has become unavailable. This in turn is sufficient to assume that all the shuffle blocks which were managed by the Shuffle service on that host are lost. Therefore, just recomputing the shuffle blocks associated with the particular Executor for which FetchFailed exception occurred is not sufficient. We need to recompute all the shuffle blocks, managed by that service because there could be multiple executors running on that host.\r\n\r\nSince not all the shuffle blocks (for all the executors on the host) are recomputed, this causes future attempts of the reduce stage to fail as well because the new tasks scheduled still keep trying to reach the old location of the shuffle blocks (which were not recomputed) and keep throwing further FetchFailed exceptions. This ultimately causes the job to fail, after the reduce stage has been retried 4 times.\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are proposed to address the above issue:\r\n1. In case of FetchFailed exception when using external shuffle service, mark all the shuffle outputs on the host as failed (due to failure of external shuffle service).\r\n2. Thus recompute all the lost shuffle blocks, instead of for just one executor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Added unit test for the change in functionality.\r\n2. Tested on a cluster with Spark running on Yarn (with external shuffle enabled), by performing the following steps:\r\n- Start a word count job, and wait for the Map stage to be completed\r\n- During the reduce stage, stop the external shuffle service on a host\r\n- Wait for fetch failed exception to occur, while fetching shuffle blocks from the host\r\n- Check that in the reattempt of the Map stage, Spark computes all the lost shuffle blocks for the host on which shuffle service was stopped\r\n- Job completes successfully, since reduce stage in next reattempt finds all the shuffle blocks\r\n@kayousterhout @mridulm

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExisting logic seemingly writes null to the BatchCommitLog, even though it does additional checks to write '{}' (valid json) to the log. This PR simplifies the logic by disallowing use of `log.add(batchId, metadata)` and instead using `log.add(batchId)`. No question of specifying metadata, so no confusion related to null. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests pass.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems `checkType` and the type string in `structField` are not being tested closely. This string format currently seems SparkR-specific (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d1f6c64c4b763c05d6d79ae5497f298dc3835f3e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/api/r/SQLUtils.scala#L93-L131) but resembles SQL type definition.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it seems nicer if we test positive/negative cases in R side.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `test_sparkSQL.R`.","created_at":"2017-03-27T03:31:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:36Z","closed_at":"2017-03-27T17:45:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa38c158f856eb64d93f54239678d9aabc1cbb85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32ba2e1a6b61be951dec4951670ece161ae1fe5c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:r-typestring-tests","ref":"r-typestring-tests","sha":"32ba2e1a6b61be951dec4951670ece161ae1fe5c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current stage, we don't have advanced statistics such as sketches or histograms. As a result, some operator can't estimate `nullCount` accurately. E.g. left outer join estimation does not accurately update `nullCount` currently. So for `IsNull` and `IsNotNull` predicates, we only estimate them when the child is a leaf node, whose `nullCount` is accurate.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test case is added in `FilterEstimationSuite`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-27T03:28:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T15:44:16Z","closed_at":"2017-03-27T15:44:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"774b0299dca087d5c3729fe5f228aacecac0b7a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62a8ae514ee22e73e88d8e399a03dcf74195d4de","head":{"label":"wzhfy:nullEstimation","ref":"nullEstimation","sha":"62a8ae514ee22e73e88d8e399a03dcf74195d4de","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe master snapshot publisher builds are currently broken due to two minor build issues:\r\n\r\n1. For unknown reasons, the LFTP `mkdir -p` command began throwing errors when the remote directory already exists. This change of behavior might have been caused by configuration changes in the ASF's SFTP server, but I'm not entirely sure of that. To work around this problem, this patch updates the script to ignore errors from the `lftp mkdir -p` commands.\r\n2. The PySpark `setup.py` file references a non-existent `pyspark.ml.stat` module, causing Python packaging to fail by complaining about a missing directory. The fix is to simply drop that line from the setup script.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe LFTP fix was tested by manually running the failing commands on AMPLab Jenkins against the ASF SFTP server. The PySpark fix was tested locally.","created_at":"2017-03-26T21:20:19Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T17:43:52Z","closed_at":"2017-03-27T17:26:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b13c670cb22d0ea1b27646b3b5835580b8b9848","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/867ca2ccab8fe75861a246e166da175086c45248","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:spark-20102","ref":"spark-20102","sha":"867ca2ccab8fe75861a246e166da175086c45248","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current SessionState initialization code path is quite complex. A part of the creation is done in the SessionState companion objects, a part of the creation is one inside the SessionState class, and a part is done by passing functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors this code path, and consolidates SessionState initialization into a builder class. This SessionState will not do any initialization and just becomes a place holder for the various Spark SQL internals. This also lays the ground work for two future improvements:\r\n\r\n1. This provides us with a start for removing the `HiveSessionState`. Removing the `HiveSessionState` would also require us to move resource loading into a separate class, and to (re)move metadata hive.\r\n2. This makes it easier to customize the Spark Session. Currently you will need to create a custom version of the builder. I have added hooks to facilitate this. A future step will be to create a semi stable API on top of this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2017-03-26T10:07:07Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T02:09:53Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T02:09:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4b93beb63c4b0c30968a2865b145324ef4ad050","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c5ed966f0e17c0f4d6f40cead45c006b3064562","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-20100","ref":"SPARK-20100","sha":"4c5ed966f0e17c0f4d6f40cead45c006b3064562","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe are currently detecting the changes in `R/` directory only and then trigger AppVeyor tests.\r\n\r\nIt seems we need to tests when there are Scala codes dedicated for R in `core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/r/`, `sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/api/r/` and `mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/r/` too.\r\n\r\nThis will enables the tests, for example, for SPARK-20088.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests with manually created PRs. \r\n\r\n- Changes in
