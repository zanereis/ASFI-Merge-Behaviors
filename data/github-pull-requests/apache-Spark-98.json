If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new client-streaming RPC service \"AddArtifacts\" to handle the transfer of artifacts from the client to the server. New message types `AddArtifactsRequest` and `AddArtifactsResponse` are added that specify the format of artifact transfer.\r\n\r\nAn artifact is defined by its `name` and `data` fields.\r\n\r\n- `name`\r\n  - The name of the artifact is expected in the form of a \"Relative Path\" that is made up of a sequence of directories and the final file element.\r\n  - Examples of \"Relative Path\"s: `jars/test.jar`,  `classes/xyz.class`, `abc.xyz`, `a/b/X.jar`.\r\n  - The server is expected to maintain the hierarchy of files as defined by their name. (i.e The relative path of the file on the server's filesystem will be the same as the name of the provided artifact).\r\n- `data`\r\n  - The raw data of the artifact.\r\n\r\nThe intention behind the `name` format is to add extensibility to the approach. Through this scheme, the server can maintain the hierarchy/grouping of files in any way the client specifies as well as transfer different \"forms\" of artifacts without needing any updates to the protocol/code itself.\r\n\r\nThe protocol supports batching and chunking (due to gRPC size limits) of artifacts as required.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the decoupled client-server architecture of Spark Connect, a remote client may use a local JAR or a new class in their UDF that may not be present on the server. To handle these cases of missing \"artifacts\", a protocol for artifact transfer is needed to move the required artifacts from the client side over to the server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using the 'builtin' Hive version for the Hive metadata client, do not create a separate classloader, and rather continue to use the overall user/application classloader (regardless of Java version). This standardizes the behavior for all Java versions with that of Java 9+. See SPARK-42539 for more details on why this approach was chosen.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPlease see a much more detailed description in SPARK-42539. The tl;dr is that user-provided JARs (such as `hive-exec-2.3.8.jar`) take precedence over Spark/system JARs when constructing the classloader used by `IsolatedClientLoader` on Java 8 in 'builtin' mode, which can cause unexpected behavior and/or breakages. This violates the expectation that, unless user-first classloader mode is used, Spark JARs should be prioritized over user JARs. It also seems that this separate classloader was unnecessary from the start, since the intent of 'builtin' mode is to use the JARs already existing on the regular classloader (as alluded to [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24057#discussion_r265142878)). The isolated clientloader was originally added in #5876 in 2015. This bit in the PR description is the only mention of the behavior for \"builtin\":\r\n> attempt to discover the jars that were used to load Spark SQL and use those. This option is only valid when using the execution version of Hive.\r\n\r\nI can't follow the logic here; the user classloader clearly has all of the necessary Hive JARs, since that's where we're getting the JAR URLs from, so we could just use that directly instead of grabbing the URLs. When this was initially added, it only used the JARs from the user classloader, not any of its parents, which I suspect was the motivating factor (to try to avoid more Spark classes being duplicated inside of the isolated classloader, I guess). But that was changed a month later anyway in #6435 / #6459, so I think this may have basically been deadcode from the start. It has also caused at least one issue over the years, e.g. SPARK-21428, which disables the new-classloader behavior in the case of running inside of a CLI session.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except to protect Spark itself from potentially being broken by bad user JARs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis includes a new unit test in `HiveUtilsSuite` which demonstrates the issue and shows that this approach resolves it. It has also been tested on a live cluster running Java 8 and Hive communication functionality continues to work as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSometimes, the SQL exists filter which condition compares the window function `ROW_NUMBER()` with number. For example,\r\n```\r\nSELECT *,\r\n         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY a) AS rn\r\nFROM Tab1\r\nWHERE rn <= 5\r\n```\r\nWe can create a `Limit` as the parent node of `Window` node. Such as: `Limit(Literal(5), Window)` and the optimizer rule `LimitPushDownThroughWindow` will push down the `Limit` as the child of `Window`. After this optimization, Spark executes top n and reduce the data size before shuffle. We can consider the SQL adjusted as the below.\r\n```\r\nSELECT *,\r\n         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY a) AS rn\r\nFROM \r\n    (SELECT *\r\n    FROM Tab1\r\n    ORDER BY  a LIMIT 5) t\r\n```\r\nIn short, it supports following pattern:\r\n```\r\nSELECT (... row_number()\r\n    OVER (\r\nORDER BY  ... ) AS rn)\r\nWHERE rn (==|<|<=) k\r\n        AND other conditions\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the performance by infer window limit and push down it through window when partitionSpec is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe top n (`Limit` + `Sort`) have better performance than `WindowGroupLimit` if the window function is `RowNumber` and `Window`'s partitionSpec is empty.\r\nBefore this PR, the micro benchmark of Top-K show below.\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_311-b11 on Mac OS X 10.16\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProtobuf deserializer (`from_protobuf()` function()) optionally supports recursive fields up to certain depth. Currently it uses `NullType` to terminate the recursion. But an `ArrayType` containing `NullType` is not really useful and  it does not work delta.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by removing the field to terminate recursion rather than using `NullType`. \r\nThe following example illustrates the difference. \r\n\r\nE.g. Consider a recursive Protobuf like this:\r\n```\r\nmessage Node {\r\n    int value = 1;\r\n    repeated Node children = 2  // recursive array\r\n}\r\nmessage Tree {\r\n    Node root = 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCatalyst schama with `from_protobuf()` of `Tree` with max recursive depth set to 2, would be:\r\n \r\n   - **Before**:  _STRUCT<root: STRUCT<value: int, children: array<STRUCT<value: int, **children: array< void >**>>>>_\r\n   - **After**: _STRUCT<root: STRUCT<value: int, children: array<STRUCT<value: int>>>>_\r\n\r\nNotice that at second level, the `children` array is dropped, rather than being defined as `array<void>`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n - This improves how Protobuf connector handles recursive fields. It avoids using `void` fields which are problematic in many scenarios and do not add any information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n - This changes the schema in a subtle manner while using with recursive support enabled. Since this only removes an optional field, it is backward compatible. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Added multiple unit tests and updated existing one. Most of the changes for this PR are in the tests.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the internal error `Child is not Cast or ExpressionProxy of Cast` for valid `CaseWhen` expr with `Cast` expr in its branches.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, after SPARK-39865, an improved error msg for overflow exception during table insert was introduced. The improvement covers `Cast` expr and `ExpressionProxy` expr, but `CaseWhen` and other complex ones are not covered. An example below hits an internal error today.\r\n```\r\ncreate table t1 as select x FROM values (1), (2), (3) as tab(x);\r\ncreate table t2 (x Decimal(9, 0));\r\ninsert into t2 select 0 - (case when x = 1 then 1 else x end) from t1 where x = 1;\r\n```\r\nTo fix the query failure, we decide to fall back to the previous handling if the expr is not a simple `Cast` expr or `ExpressionProxy` expr.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix the query regression introduced in SPARK-39865.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. We just fall back to the previous error msg if the expression involving `Cast` is not a simple one.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added Unit test.\r\n- Removed one test case for the `Child is not Cast or ExpressionProxy of Cast` internal error, as now we do not check if the child has a `Cast` expression and fall back to the previous error message.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-23T06:22:21Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T20:05:51Z","closed_at":"2023-02-24T20:05:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f038cec889231e20212406df948fe92404704d83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99463914fb0649c66fd97b99892acc8d47c0ccc4","head":{"label":"RunyaoChen:cast_fix_branch_3.3_cp","ref":"cast_fix_branch_3.3_cp","sha":"99463914fb0649c66fd97b99892acc8d47c0ccc4","user":{"login":"RunyaoChen","id":114445704,"node_id":"U_kgDOBtJNiA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114445704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/RunyaoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":591534378,"node_id":"R_kgDOI0IZKg","name":"spark","full_name":"RunyaoChen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RunyaoChen","id":114445704,"node_id":"U_kgDOBtJNiA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114445704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen","html_url":"https://github.com/RunyaoChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RunyaoChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RunyaoChen/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBefore 3.4, the `Add` did not check overflow. Instead, we always wrapped `Add` with a `CheckOverflow`. After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36698, we make `Add` check overflow by itself. However, the bound ordering of window range frame uses `Add` to calculate the boundary that is used to determine which input row lies within the frame boundaries of an output row. Then the behavior is changed with an extra overflow check. \r\n\r\nTechnically，We could allow an overflowing value if it is just an intermediate result. So this pr use `DecimalAddNoOverflowCheck` to replace the `Add` to restore the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, restore the previous(before 3.4) behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExisting implementation always convert inputs (maybe column or column name) to columns, this cause `AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE` issue since there maybe several columns with the same name.\r\n\r\nIn the JVM side, the logics of drop(column: Column) and drop(columnName: String) are different, we can not simply always convert a column name to column via col() method.\r\n\r\nWhen there are multi-column with the same name (e.g, `name`), users can:\r\n1, `drop('name')` --- drop all the columns;\r\n2, `drop(df1.name)` --- drop the column from the specific dataframe `df1`;\r\n\r\nBut if users call `drop(col('name'))`, it will fail due to ambiguous issue.\r\n\r\nIn Pyspark, it is a bit complex, that the user can input both column names with columns. This PR drops the columns first, and then the column names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import Row\r\n>>> df1 = spark.createDataFrame([(14, \"Tom\"), (23, \"Alice\"), (16, \"Bob\")], [\"age\", \"name\"])\r\n>>> df2 = spark.createDataFrame([Row(height=80, name=\"Tom\"), Row(height=85, name=\"Bob\")])\r\n>>> df3 = df1.join(df2, df1.name == df2.name, 'inner')\r\n>>> df3.show()\r\n+---+----+------+----+\r\n|age|name|height|name|\r\n+---+----+------+----+\r\n| 16| Bob|    85| Bob|\r\n| 14| Tom|    80| Tom|\r\n+---+----+------+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nBEFORE\r\n```\r\n>>> df3.drop(\"name\", \"age\").columns\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.captured.AnalysisException: [AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE] Reference `name` is ambiguous, could be: [`name`, `name`].\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFTER\r\n```\r\n>>> df3.drop(\"name\", \"age\").columns\r\n['height']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes DB2 Limit clause syntax. Although DB2 supports LIMIT keyword, it seems that this support varies across databases and versions and the recommended way is to use `FETCH FIRST x ROWS ONLY`. In fact, some versions don't support LIMIT at all. Doc: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=subselect-fetch-clause, usage example: https://www.mullinsconsulting.com/dbu_0502.htm.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes the incorrect Limit clause which could cause errors when using against DB2 versions that don't support LIMIT.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test and an integration test to cover this

files).","created_at":"2023-02-22T20:47:49Z","updated_at":"2023-02-23T15:45:52Z","closed_at":"2023-02-23T15:45:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"894e336f4cf4e947f7b8392e3c49eeacb11764d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aad07e62ac76aa484760856aa7cbbf719420d372","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-42531","ref":"SPARK-42531","sha":"aad07e62ac76aa484760856aa7cbbf719420d372","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Instead of creating multiple sub directories in k8s upload directory (spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path) for each file to be uploaded, create a single subdirectory to be used for all file uploads of a specific application. This directory will be named using the spark application id.\r\n2. Delete the sub directory and it's content when job terminates\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is required to cleanup the files and directories which are created under the k8s upload path to prevent space getting full. without this change, user needs to manually clean up these files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Users submitting spark on k8s job, won't need to manually cleanup the files under upload directory.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThrough git action and manually by running jobs in local k8s cluster.\r\nAlso, added unit test for testing the change in behaviour of sub directory creation under upload path.\r\n\r\nSome logs for verification:\r\n\r\n23/02/22 18:41:16 INFO SparkContext: Successfully stopped

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change auto-generation of column aliases (the case when an user doesn't assign any alias explicitly). Before the changes, Spark SQL generates such alias from `Expression` but this PR proposes to take the parse tree (output of lexer), and generate an alias using the term tokens from the tree.\r\n\r\nNew helper function `ParserUtils.toExprAlias` takes a `ParseTree` from `Antlr4`, and converts it to a `String` using the following simple rule:\r\n- Concatenate all terminal nodes of the lexer tree without any gaps.\r\n- Upper case keywords and numeric literals.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sequence of tokens \"1\", \"in\", \"(\", \"1.0d\" \")\" is converted to the alias \"1IN(1.0D)\".\r\n\r\nBy default, the feature is off, and the SQL config `spark.sql.stableDerivedColumnAlias.enabled` allows to enable it.\r\n\r\nCloses #39332 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. It is always best practice to name the result of any expressions in a queries select list,  if one plans to reference them later. This yields the most readable results and stability. However, sometimes queries are generated or we’re just lazy and trust in the auto generated names. The problem is that the auto-generated names are produced by pretty printing the expression tree which is, while “generally” readable, not meant to be stable across long durations of time. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> DESC SELECT substring('hello', 5);\r\nsubstring(hello, 5, 2147483647)\tstring\r\n```\r\nthe auto-generated column alias `substring(hello, 5, 2147483647)` contains not-obvious elements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.ResolveAliasesSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-02-22T18:13:09Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T14:04:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T06:14:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60f2e45b5b473bc8315548d718c295a26701cdd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74d6b48c7e9392ea15a6f800b5b10ce482d3985c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:stable-derived-column-aliases-2","ref":"stable-derived-column-aliases-2","sha":"74d6b48c7e9392ea15a6f800b5b10ce482d3985c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

So, we should not cache the local port but have the new local port.\r\n\r\nFor example, in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40109, the Spark Connect server at `ReadwriterTestsMixin` stops after the tests.

The improvement request is to support multiple dataframes with variable arity. We have cases where we want to pass multiple(20 to 30) data frames to `cogroup.applyInPandas` function which then are used to either combine them together for further processing in spark or emit excel files or combined graphs. Workarounds are possible but they are very inefficient and error-prone.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe previous experimental implementation is awkward. The UDF can accept either 2 or 3 args. If 2 args are passed in the UDF then UDF receives 2 cogrouped DFs, if 3 args are passed then UDF receives 2 cogrouped DFs with grouping key as the first arg. he previous API is limiting and has implications on new proposed change. There is no clear way of distinguishing whether 3 args are for 3 DFs or 2 DFs + 1 grouping key. \r\nThis change removes this behaviour. In this change, we always pass key as first arg to the UDF. \r\nBreaking change:\r\n```python\r\ndef test_udf(df1, df2):\r\n    return df1\r\n\r\ndf1.groupby(\"id\").cogroup(df2.groupby(\"id\")).applyInPandas(\r\n    test_udf, \"time int, id int, v1 double\").show()\r\n\r\n```\r\nBEFORE:\r\n```\r\n+--------+---+---+\r\n|    time| id| v1|\r\n+--------+---+---+\r\n|20000101|  1|1.0|\r\n|20000102|  1|3.0|\r\n|20000101|  2|2.0|\r\n|20000102|  2|4.0|\r\n+--------+---+---+\r\n```\r\nAFTER:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"previous.py\", line 64, in <module>\r\n    df1.groupby(\"id\").cogroup(df2.groupby(\"id\")).applyInPandas(\r\n  File

cogroup.applyInPandas must contain vararg or must take three or more argument with key being first\r\n```\r\nTo make it work, change the UDF:\r\n```python\r\ndef test_udf(key, df1, df2):\r\n    return df1\r\n\r\ndf1.groupby(\"id\").cogroup(df2.groupby(\"id\")).applyInPandas(\r\n    test_udf, \"time int, id int, v1

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReimplement `PercentileHeap` such that:\r\n- the percentile value is always in the `topHeap`, this speeds up `percentile` access\r\n- rebalance the heaps more efficiently by checking which heap should grow due to the new insertion and doing a rebalance based on target heap sizes\r\n- the heaps are java PriorityQueue's *without* comparators. Comparator call overhead slows down `poll`/`offer` by more than 2x. Instead implement a max-heap by `poll`/`offer` on the negated domain of numbers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`PercentileHeap` is heavy weight enough to cause scheduling delays if inserted inside the scheduler loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded more extensive

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhance `LimitPushDown` to support push down topK through join. The key idea is that if the order expressions comes from one join side and pushing down topK does not affect query result:\r\n1. Left outer join and order expressions come from the left side.\r\n2. Right outer join and order expressions come from the right side.\r\n3. Inner join, cross join, left outer join, right outer join, full outer join and join condition is empty and order expressions from one side.\r\n4. Left anti join, left semi join and join condition is empty and order expressions from left side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpgrade pandas from 1.1.5 to 1.5.3, numpy from 1.19.4 to 1.20.3 in the Dockerfile used for Spark releases.\r\n\r\nThey are also what we use to cut `v3.4.0-rc1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOtherwise, errors are raised as shown below when building release docs.\r\n```\r\nImportError: Warning: Latest version of pandas (1.5.3) is required to generate the documentation; however, your version was 1.1.5\r\n\r\nImportError: this version of pandas is incompatible with numpy < 1.20.3\r\nyour numpy version is 1.19.4.\r\nPlease upgrade numpy to >= 1.20.3 to use this pandas version\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to capture the session time zone config (`spark.sql.session.timeZone`) as a view property, and use it while re-parsing/analysing the view. If the SQL config is not set while creating a view, use the default value of the config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. The current behaviour might confuse users because query results depends on whether or not the session time zone was set explicitly while creating a view.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the current value of the session time zone is used in view analysis but this behaviour can be restored via another SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.useCurrentConfigsForView`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the new test via:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.PersistedViewTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-02-21T09:00:34Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T11:03:30Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T11:03:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"470268468254d70d8edfa33c82c4035862e25f43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28b57f4d4a12474f59ff69d5bfbf0a32a1cdc4c4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:view-tz-conf","ref":"view-tz-conf","sha":"28b57f4d4a12474f59ff69d5bfbf0a32a1cdc4c4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr improves the `NestedColumnAliasing` to support prune the adjacent project nodes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCollapseProject won't combine adjacent projects into one, e.g. non-cheap expression has been accessed more than once with the below project. Then there would be possible to appear some adjacent project nodes that `NestedColumnAliasing` does not support pruning.\r\n\r\nIt's a common case with lateral column alias that it would push down an extra project, e.g.\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t (c struct<c1: int, c2 string>) USING PARQUET;\r\nSELECT c.c1, c.c1 + 1 as x, x + 1 FROM t;\r\n\r\n-- before\r\n*(1) Project [c#15.c1 AS c1#53, x#47, (x#47 + 1) AS (lateralAliasReference(x) + 1)#55]\r\n+- *(1) Project [c#15, (c#15.c1 + 1) AS x#47]\r\n   +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n      +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[c#15] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<c:struct<c1:int,c2:string>>\r\n\r\n-- after\r\n*(1) Project [_extract_c1#38 AS c1#34, x#27, (x#27 + 1) AS (lateralAliasReference(x) + 1)#37]\r\n+- *(1) Project [c#33.c1 AS _extract_c1#38, (c#33.c1 + 1) AS x#27]\r\n   +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n      +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[c#33] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<c:struct<c1:int>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n## Common classes\r\n\r\nThis PR move following packages/classes into new module `spark-mllib-common`:\r\n1, `org.apache.spark.ml.attribute.*`\r\n2, `org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.*`\r\n3, `org.apache.spark.ml.param.*` except: \r\n - `SharedParamsCodeGen` due to it depends on `spark-core`, and it is not a runtime dependency; \r\n - `getExecutionContext` method in `HasParallelism` due to it depends on `spark-core`;\r\n\r\n4, `org.apache.spark.ml.PredictorParams`\r\n5, `org.apache.spark.ml.classification.ClassifierParams`\r\n6, `org.apache.spark.ml.classification.ProbabilisticClassifierParams`\r\n7, `org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable`\r\n8, `org.apache.spark.ml.util.SchemaUtils`\r\n9, `org.apache.spark.ml.feature.{LabeledPoint, Instance}`\r\n\r\nWhen implementing the algorithms, we should also move corresponding Params traits into `spark-mllib-common`, e.g. `DecisionTreeParams`, `DecisionTreeClassifierParams`, etc\r\n\r\n## Testsuites\r\n\r\nThis PR moves following testsuites to `spark-mllib-common`:\r\n1, `org.apache.spark.ml.attribute.*`\r\n2, `org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.*` except `test(\"JavaTypeInference with VectorUDT\")` in `VectorUDTSuite` due to cyclical dependency;\r\n3, `org.apache.spark.ml.param.*` except `test(\"Filtering ParamMap\")` in `ParamsSuite` due to cyclical dependency;\r\n4, `org.apache.spark.ml.util.IdentifiableSuite`\r\n\r\n## Dependency\r\n\r\nThe new module `spark-mllib-common` depends on following packages:\r\n1, `json4s-jackson`\r\n2, `spark-tags`\r\n3, `spark-mllib-local`\r\n4, `spark-catalyst`:\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.types.*`\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow` in `VectorUDT` and `MatrixUDT`\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.{GenericInternalRow, UnsafeArrayData}` in `VectorUDT` and `MatrixUDT`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependency changes\r\n\r\nThis PR make `spark-mllib` depend on the `spark-mllib-common`;\r\n\r\nThis PR make Spark Connect Scala Client `spark-connect-client-jvm` depend on the `spark-mllib-common`;\r\n\r\nThis PR make Spark Connect Server `spark-connect` depend on the `spark-mllib`;\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reorg mllib modules\r\n\r\nThis PR also reorg the mllib modules:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmllib\r\n  | --- core: spark-mllib\r\n  | --- local: spark-mllib-local\r\n  | --- common: spark-mllib-common\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto support ML APIs atop Spark-Connect Scala Client\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nupdated tests","created_at":"2023-02-21T01:03:02Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T00:22:40Z","closed_at":"2023-03-14T23:31:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a908f6a52665482309bf9ad3e2f284066205e1cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35b5ebed801ebcc99375cda55e76355f34107563","head":{"label":"zhengruifeng:connect_decision_tree","ref":"connect_decision_tree","sha":"35b5ebed801ebcc99375cda55e76355f34107563","user":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51584791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU4NDc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengruifeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `ConstantPropagation` to support more cases. \r\n1. Propagated through other binary comparisons.\r\n2. Propagated across equality comparisons. This can be further optimized to `false`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\na = 1 and b > a + 2 ==> a = 1 && b > 3\r\na = 1 and a = 2 ==> 2 = 1 and 1 = 2 ==> false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance. [Denodo](https://community.denodo.com/docs/html/browse/latest/en/vdp/administration/optimizing_queries/automatic_simplification_of_queries/removing_redundant_branches_of_queries_partitioned_unions) also has a similar optimization. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(a int, b int) using parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(x int, y int) using parquet;\r\n\r\nCREATE TEMP VIEW v1 AS                                        \r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 WHERE a = x AND a = 0                \r\nUNION ALL                                                     \r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 WHERE a = x AND (a IS NULL OR a <> 0);\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM v1 WHERE x > 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nUnion false, false\r\n:- Project [a#0 AS a#12, b#1 AS b#13, x#2 AS x#14, y#3 AS y#15]\r\n:  +- Join

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new higher order function `filter_value` which takes a column to validate and a function that takes the result of that column and returns a boolean indicating whether to keep the value or return null. This is semantically the same as a `when` expression passing the column into a validation function, except it guarantees to only evaluate the initial column once. The idea was taken from the Scala `Option.filter`, open to other names if anyone has a better idea.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nConditionally evaluated expressions are currently not candidates for subexpression elimination. This can lead to a lot of duplicate evaluations of expressions when doing common data cleaning tasks, such as only keeping a value if it matches some validation checks. It gets worse when multiple different checks are chained together, and you can end up with a single expensive expression being evaluated numerous times.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32987 attempts to solve this by allowing conditionally evaluated expressions to be candidates for subexpression elimination, however I have not been able to get that merged in the past 1.5 years. I still think that is valuable and useful, especially as an opt-in behavior, but this is an alternative option to help improve performance of these kinds of data validation tasks.\r\n\r\nA custom implementation of `NullIf` could help as well, however it would only support exact equals checks, where this can support any logic you need to do validation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAdds a new function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UTs.","created_at":"2023-02-19T13:54:37Z","updated_at":"2024-08-25T00:24:02Z","closed_at":"2024-08-25T00:24:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5a8cfb02d2e11d41759288466e47710612bd29a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/988dcb7f8393c79f7843b5398a1d034f7c78ba99","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:filter-value","ref":"filter-value","sha":"988dcb7f8393c79f7843b5398a1d034f7c78ba99","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProtobuf serializer (used in `to_protobuf()`) should error if non-nullable fields (i.e. protobuf `required` fields) are present in the schema of the catalyst record being converted to a protobuf.\r\n\r\nBut `isNullable()` method used for this check returns opposite (see PR comment in the diff).  As a result, Serializer incorrectly requires the fields that are optional. This PR fixes this check (see PR comment in the diff).\r\n\r\nThis also requires corresponding fix for couple of unit tests. In order use a Protobuf message with a `required` field, Protobuf version 2 file `proto2_messages.proto` is added.\r\nTwo tests are updated to verify missing required fields results in an error.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is need to fix a bug where we were incorrectly enforcing a schema check on optional fields rather than on required fields. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes the alias name for numpy literals.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes `F.lit` in Spark Connect to support `np.bool_` objects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently the alias name for literals created from numpy scalars contains something like `CAST(` ... `AS <type>)`, but it should be removed and return only the value string as same as literals from Python numbers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe alias name will be changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModifed/enabled

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShowing the essential information when throwing `InvalidUnsafeRowException`. Including where the check failed, and status of the `unsafeRow` and `expctedSchema`\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\n[UnsafeRowStatus] expectedSchema: StructType(StructField(key1,IntegerType,false),StructField(key2,IntegerType,false),StructField(sum(key1),IntegerType,false),StructField(sum(key2),IntegerType,false)), expectedSchemaNumFields: 4, numFields: 4, bitSetWidthInBytes: 8, rowSizeInBytes: 40 \r\nfieldStatus: \r\n[UnsafeRowFieldStatus] index: 0, expectedFieldType: IntegerType, isNull: false, isFixedLength: true, offset: -1, size: -1\r\n[UnsafeRowFieldStatus] index: 1, expectedFieldType: IntegerType, isNull: false, isFixedLength: true, offset: -1, size: -1\r\n[UnsafeRowFieldStatus] index: 2, expectedFieldType: IntegerType, isNull: false, isFixedLength: true, offset: -1, size: -1\r\n[UnsafeRowFieldStatus] index: 3, expectedFieldType: IntegerType, isNull: false, isFixedLength: true, offset: -1, size: -1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Reduce the number of retries when sending a request to spark connect service.\r\n* Slightly improve debug logging\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, 15 retries with the current backoff strategy result in the client sitting in\r\nthe retry loop for ~400 seconds in the worst case. This means, applications and\r\nusers using the spark connect client will hang for >6 minutes with no response.\r\n\r\nInstead, simply reduce the retry to 4, which reduces the retry loop in the worst case\r\nto a reasonable ~4 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nReduces the number of retries to the service and improves error response time\r\nwhen the spark connect service is unresponsive or unreachable.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch allows for eager execution of SQL statements using the Spark Connect Data Frame API. When `spark.sql` is called it will send the query to the server where a DataFrame is created and cached with the Session. If the query is a command this transformation will immediately kick of the execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit and e2e testing\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Add unit tests\r\n- [x] Add e2e python

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis makes `ProtoToPlanTestSuite` use analyzed plans instead of parsed plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to increase the fidelity of the `ProtoToPlanTestSuite`, especially since we are going to be adding functions. Functions are special because the spark connect planner leaves them unresolved, the actual binding only happens in the analyzer. Without running the analyzer we would not know if the bindings are correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt is a test change.","created_at":"2023-02-16T17:42:01Z","updated_at":"2023-02-16T22:43:27Z","closed_at":"2023-02-16T22:33:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a354b84be0e0df49b6bdada3fd186fca17b1434","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc3554a8e17716f462add7c2fe269515a9d4dee9","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-42465","ref":"SPARK-42465","sha":"dc3554a8e17716f462add7c2fe269515a9d4dee9","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `ProtoToPlanTestSuite` were broken for Scala 2.13 . This was caused by the following two problems:\r\n- Explain output between 2.12 and 2.13 is not stable because we render collection implementations as well. For this I changed the rendering of the offending classes to be version agnostic.\r\n- UDF code had deserialization issues. This was always the risk. I have removed those tests, we will work on improving UDF coverage in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to test Scala 2.13 as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest only change.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-16T14:28:24Z","updated_at":"2023-02-16T22:06:41Z","closed_at":"2023-02-16T18:47:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e809c88712a0e53335e8a95fbd8526b0c485ca0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/003c35a33b9504295ee02c46231ff1e46b95cc9c","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-42464","ref":"SPARK-42464","sha":"003c35a33b9504295ee02c46231ff1e46b95cc9c","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Spark Connect service's `client_type` attribute (which is really [user\r\nagent]) is set to `_SPARK_CONNECT_PYTHON` to signify PySpark.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the connection for the Spark Connect remote accepts an optional\r\n`user_agent` parameter which is then passed down to the service.\r\n\r\n[user agent]: https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis enables partners using Spark Connect to set their application as the user agent,\r\nwhich then allows visibility and measurement of integrations and usages of spark\r\nconnect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nA new optional `user_agent`
