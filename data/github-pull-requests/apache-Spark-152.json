the JdbcConnectionProvider API such that a provider can indicate that it will need to modify the global security configuration when establishing a connection, and as such, if access to the global security configuration should be synchronized to prevent races.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs suggested by @gaborgsomogyi [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r755788709), augments the `JdbcConnectionProvider` API to include a `modifiesSecurityContext` method that can be used by `ConnectionProvider` to determine when `SecurityConfigurationLock.synchronized` is required to avoid race conditions when establishing a JDBC connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvides a path forward for working around a significant bottleneck introduced by synchronizing `SecurityConfigurationLock` every time a connection is established. The synchronization isn't always needed and it should be at the discretion of the `JdbcConnectionProvider` to determine when locking is necessary. See [SPARK-37391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37391) or [this thread](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29024/files#r754441783).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAny existing implementations of `JdbcConnectionProvider` will need to add a definition of `modifiesSecurityContext`. I'm also open to adding a default implementation, but it seemed to me that requiring an explicit implementation of the method was preferable.\r\n\r\nA drop-in implementation that would continue the existing behavior is:\r\n```scala\r\noverride def modifiesSecurityContext(\r\n  driver: Driver,\r\n  options: Map[String, String]\r\n): Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, but I also plan to run a real workflow once I get the initial thumbs up on this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `HiveSessionResourceLoader`,  call the  function `addJars` of its supper class firstly and set the contextClassLoader in current thread, and then  use the `addJars` in `HiveClient`. to avoid that different class loaders load the same class. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nwhen using livy to execute sql statements that will use the udf jars located in lakefs, a inner filesystem in Tencent Cloud DLC. it will threw the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n`java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: loader (instance of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n#33588 (comment) show Spark cannot read/write timestamp ntz and ltz correctly. Based on the discussion https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34712#issuecomment-981402675, we just to fix read/write timestamp ntz to Orc uses UTC timestamp.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is Orc write/read timestamp with local timezone in default. The local timezone will be changed.\r\nIf the Orc writer write timestamp with local timezone(e.g. America/Los_Angeles), when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with other local timezone(e.g. Europe/Amsterdam), the value of timestamp will be different.\r\n\r\nIf we let the Orc writer write timestamp with UTC timezone, when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with UTC timezone too, the value of timestamp will be correct.\r\n\r\nThe related Orc source:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/3f1e57cf1cebe58027c1bd48c09eef4e9717a9e3/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/WriterImpl.java#L525\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/1f68ac0c7f2ae804b374500dcf1b4d7abe30ffeb/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/TreeReaderFactory.java#L1184\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug about read/write timestamp ntz from/to Orc with different times zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Orc timestamp ntz is a new feature not release yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T11:59:41Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T14:44:40Z","closed_at":"2022-03-24T14:44:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82bc7fdcf133cda0c94695fe00fed5b8fb679b2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03a764036674fc0a9934ee1f8b7b54457a2c9176","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-37463-new","ref":"SPARK-37463-new","sha":"03a764036674fc0a9934ee1f8b7b54457a2c9176","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supports push down limit to data source.\r\nHowever, in the user's scenario, limit must have the premise of order by. Because limit and order by are more valuable together.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, push down top N(same as order by ... limit N) outputs the data with basic order to Spark sort, the the sort of Spark may have some performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. push down top N is very useful for users scenario.\r\n2. push down top N could improves the performance of sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe will store table schema in table properties for the read-side to restore. In Spark 3.1, we add char/varchar support natively. In some commands like `create table`, `alter table` with these types,  the `char(x)` or `varchar(x)` will be stored directly to those properties. If a user uses Spark 2 to read such a table it will fail to parse the schema.\r\n\r\nFYI, https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/DataType.scala#L136\r\n\r\nA table can be a newly created one by Spark 3.1 and later or an existing one modified by Spark 3.1 and on.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbackward compatibility\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThat's not necessarily user-facing as a bugfix and only related to internal table properties.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds `scale` parameter to `floor`/`ceil` functions in order to allow users to control the rounding position. This feature is proposed in the PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34593\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we support Decimal RoundingModes : HALF_UP (round) and HALF_EVEN (bround). But we have use cases that needs RoundingMode.UP and RoundingMode.DOWN.\r\n\r\nFloor and Ceil functions helps to do this but it doesn't support the position of the rounding. Adding scale parameter to the functions would help us control the rounding positions. \r\n\r\nSnowflake supports `scale` parameter to `floor`/`ceil` :\r\n` FLOOR( <input_expr> [, <scale_expr> ] )`\r\n\r\nREF:\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/floor.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNow users can pass `scale` parameter to the `floor` and `ceil` functions.\r\n ```\r\n     > SELECT floor(-0.1);\r\n       -1.0\r\n      > SELECT floor(5);\r\n       5\r\n      > SELECT floor(3.1411, 3);\r\n       3.141\r\n      > SELECT floor(3.1411, -3);\r\n       1000.0\r\n\r\n      > SELECT ceil(-0.1);\r\n       0.0\r\n      > SELECT ceil(5);\r\n       5\r\n      > SELECT ceil(3.1411, 3);\r\n       3.142\r\n      > SELECT ceil(3.1411, -3);\r\n       1000.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested locally using unit test and git

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes migration of R API docs to [pkgdown](pkgdown.r-lib.org/). \r\n\r\nResult (not synced automatically) could look like this\r\n\r\nhttps://zero323.gitlab.io/sparkr-docs-experiments/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo improve overall experience of interactions with SparkR docs:\r\n\r\n- Arguably, much better looking than the simple R docs.\r\n- Fully linked examples allow easy inspection of the used functions.\r\n- Adds functional search.\r\n- For what is worth, all samples can be copied and pasted.\r\n- Dark mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInspection of the build

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR consolidates the code paths for subexpression elimination in whole stage and non-whole stage codegen. Whole stage codegen seemed to be mostly a superset of the non-whole stage subexpression elimination, just with whole stage not using the codegen context to track subexpressions. Since subexpression values are replaced with empty blocks when evaluated, the context should be able to track the subexpressions across multiple operators. Not sure if there's corner cases I'm missing though.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't result in any functionality changes, but there are slight differences in the generated code as a result of this:\r\n- Subexpressions in whole stage always use mutable state for results instead of inlining results to support code splitting in non-whole stage\r\n- Non-whole stage now supports the same inlining subexpressions if small enough as whole stage codegen\r\n- Subexpressions are tracked across multiple physical operators in whole stage. They are still only calculated in each operator, but if you happen to have an expression in a later operator that was a subexpression in a previous operator, it will be used in the later operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, there are different code paths to handle subexpression elimination in whole stage and non-whole stage codegen. This makes it harder to add new capabilities to subexpression elimination having to deal with independent code paths.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, just slight changes in generated code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2021-11-27T15:25:13Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T12:56:30Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T12:56:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd7c7f5bc78a681981d286fd2b9cb28f412f1751","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6a113a70c3c77853334daa0cce005ce9b74a3fe","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:consolidate-subexpr-elimination","ref":"consolidate-subexpr-elimination","sha":"e6a113a70c3c77853334daa0cce005ce9b74a3fe","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe think it has no data when the segment file not exists when all segment files produced by `BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter` is merging;\r\n\r\nHowever, `file.exists()` may rerurn `false` when then the disk which segment file in on is missing and the root catagory exists; the missing disk only lead `file.exists()` return `false` but no exception. The task will run in peace without current segment file written.\r\n\r\nThe segment data will be ignored  and leading shuffle data loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nShuffle may loss partition data leading corretness problems in final data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n the task finished as normal without exception when I delete  a partition file before segment files merge， and the final data is incorrect;\r\nThe task will retry when apply this patch\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-27T07:11:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-10T00:17:06Z","closed_at":"2022-04-10T00:17:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01e12c6c5af3f8ec618915ea10644eb1ff4b2949","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea5c574c8736049efe36bf1e0fb5751590a7236f","head":{"label":"seayoun:fix_bypass_shuffle_write_data_loss","ref":"fix_bypass_shuffle_write_data_loss","sha":"ea5c574c8736049efe36bf1e0fb5751590a7236f","user":{"login":"seayoun","id":45163307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTYzMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45163307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun","html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":228821056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjg4MjEwNTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"seayoun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seayoun","id":45163307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTYzMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45163307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun","html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun/spark","description":"Apache

If the installed version is below, Spark fails with: _\"Pandas >= 1.0.0 must be installed; however, your version was ...\"_\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome of the Pandas-on-Spark tests do not pass with Pandas < 1.0, see SPARK-37465.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users with installed Pandas versions below 1.0 will see failures. Also Pandas 1.0 introduces breaks [(listed here)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html#backwards-incompatible-api-changes) which should not affect Spark's interaction with Pandas, but it might introduce breaks to user environments that get their Pandas version transitively through PySpark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests. The Pandas version used in Github actions is 1.3.3. I'll verify tests also pass with 1.0.0.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-26T17:17:50Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T13:15:43Z","closed_at":"2021-11-27T13:15:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fabe25817be13cd90894b034be22ecc7736915e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3019e38e49e7f8c5866d5c094d12be8346c722b3","head":{"label":"rshkv:wr/spark-37465/raise-pandas-min-to-1.0","ref":"wr/spark-37465/raise-pandas-min-to-1.0","sha":"3019e38e49e7f8c5866d5c094d12be8346c722b3","user":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":243588217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDM1ODgyMTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"rshkv/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rshkv","id":7870972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7870972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv","html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshkv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rshkv/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current spark-sql, when use -e and -f, it can't support nested bracketed comment such as\r\n ```\r\n/* SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(b) */ 4;\r\n*/\r\nSELECT  1\r\n;\r\n```\r\nWhen run `spark-sql -f` with `--verbose` got below error\r\n```\r\npark master: yarn, Application Id: application_1632999510150_6968442\r\n/* sielect /*

4\r\n------------------------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn current code\r\n```\r\nelse if (line.charAt(index) == '/' && !insideSimpleComment) {\r\n        val hasNext = index + 1 < line.length\r\n        if (insideSingleQuote || insideDoubleQuote) {\r\n          // Ignores '/' in any case of quotes\r\n        } else if (insideBracketedComment && line.charAt(index - 1) == '*' ) {\r\n          // Decrements `bracketedCommentLevel` at the beginning of the next loop\r\n          leavingBracketedComment = true\r\n        } else if (hasNext && !insideBracketedComment &&  line.charAt(index + 1) == '*') {\r\n          bracketedCommentLevel += 1\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it meet an `*/`, it will mark  `leavingBracketedComment` as true, then  when call next char, bracketed comment level -1.\r\n```\r\n      if (leavingBracketedComment) {\r\n        bracketedCommentLevel -= 1\r\n        leavingBracketedComment = false\r\n      }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when meet `/*`,  it need   `!insideBracketedComment`, then means if we have a  case \r\n```\r\n/* aaa /* bbb */  ; ccc */ select 1;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nwhen meet second `/*` , `insideBracketedComment` is true, so this `/*` won't be treat as a start of bracket comment.\r\nThen meet the first `*/`, bracketed comment end, this  query is split as \r\n```\r\n/* aaa /* bbb */;    =>  comment\r\nccc */ select 1;   => query\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen query failed.\r\n\r\nSo here we remove the condition of `!insideBracketedComment`,  then we can have `bracketedCommentLevel > 1` and  since \r\n```\r\n def insideBracketedComment: Boolean = bracketedCommentLevel > 0\r\n```\r\nSo chars between all level of bracket are treated as comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn spark #37389 we support nested bracketed comment in SQL, here for spark-sql we should support too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use nested bracketed comment in spark-sql\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSince spark-sql  console mode have special logic about handle `;`\r\n```\r\n    while (line != null) {\r\n      if (!line.startsWith(\"--\")) {\r\n        if (prefix.nonEmpty) {\r\n          prefix += '\\n'\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (line.trim().endsWith(\";\") && !line.trim().endsWith(\"\\\\;\")) {\r\n          line = prefix + line\r\n          ret = cli.processLine(line, true)\r\n          prefix = \"\"\r\n          currentPrompt = promptWithCurrentDB\r\n        } else {\r\n          prefix = prefix + line\r\n          currentPrompt = continuedPromptWithDBSpaces\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      line = reader.readLine(currentPrompt + \"> \")\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we write sql as below\r\n```\r\n/* SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(b) */ 4\\\\;\r\n*/\r\nSELECT  1\r\n;\r\n```\r\nthe `\\\\;` is escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel  test wit spark-sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the metrics name `Shuffle Read Block Time` to `Shuffle Read Fetch Wait Time` in StagePage\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ShuffleReadMetrics._fetchWaitTime` shown as \"Shuffle Read Block Time\" in Stage page, and \"fetch wait time\" in the SQL page, which make us confused whether shuffle read includes fetch wait & read\r\nActually `read block time` is just a kind of display name for `fetch wait time`, So we'd better change it in same\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`shuffleReadBlockTime` metric will be changed into `Shuffle Read Fetch Wait Time` in StagePage\r\n\r\nbefore this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nunify test case:\r\n\r\n1. Move the testcase from `DDLParserSuite.scala` to `ShowCreateTableParserSuite.scala`.\r\n2. Move the testcase from `DataSourceV2SQLSuite` to `v2.ShowCreateTableSuite`.\r\n    If the test case also work with V1/Hive, then move to ShowCreateTableSuiteBase \r\n3. Move the testcase from  `sql/ShowCreateTableSuite.scala` to `v1.ShowCreateTableSuite`\r\n    If the test case also work with Hive, then move to `v1.ShowCreateTableSuiteBase`\r\n    If the test case also work with V2/Hive, then move to `ShowCreateTableSuiteBase`  \r\n4. Move the testcase from `HiveShowCreateTableSuite` to `hive.ShowCreateTableSuite`\r\n    If the test case also work with V1/V2, then move to `ShowCreateTableSuiteBase`\r\n    If the test case also work with V1, then move to `v1.ShowCreateTableSuiteBase`\r\n5. Use `getShowCreateDDL` instead of `checkCreateTable` to check the result.\r\n  \r\nfix diff behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Add one space after `create table xxx` for the command `SHOW CREATE TABLE AS SERDE` to unify the output.\r\n2. Add one space after `OPTIONS` for v2 command `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to unify the output.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of [#30287](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30287) [#34305](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34305)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `SHOW CREATE TABLE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support ANSI intervals and TimestampNTZ for `UnionEstimation`.\r\nCurrently, `UnionEstimation` doesn't support ANSI intervals and TimestampNTZ. But I think it can support those types because their underlying types are integer or long, which `UnionEstimation` can compute stats for.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make CBO better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Not interferes with the current behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nModified

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the Spark SQL parser, most of the time we treat SCHEMA and DATABASE simply be aliases of NAMESPACE. However, there are still two places that we treat them differently: USE NAMESPACE, SHOW NAMESPACES and SHOW CURRENT NAMESPACE.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these 2 places and always treats SCHEMA and DATABASE as aliases of NAMESPACE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis makes the parser consistent and easy to understand for end-users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR used to fix the issue\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33588#issuecomment-978719988\r\n\r\nThe root cause is Orc write/read timestamp with local timezone in default. The local timezone will be changed.\r\nIf the Orc writer write timestamp with local timezone(e.g. America/Los_Angeles), when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with local timezone(e.g. Europe/Amsterdam), the value of timestamp will be different.\r\n\r\nIf we let the Orc writer write timestamp with UTC timezone, when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with  UTC timezone too, the value of timestamp will be correct.\r\n\r\nThis PR let Orc write/read Timestamp with UTC timezone by call `useUTCTimestamp(true)` for readers or writers.\r\n\r\nThe related Orc source:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/3f1e57cf1cebe58027c1bd48c09eef4e9717a9e3/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/WriterImpl.java#L525\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/1f68ac0c7f2ae804b374500dcf1b4d7abe30ffeb/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/TreeReaderFactory.java#L1184\r\n\r\nAnother problem is Spark 3.3 or newer read the Orc file written by Spark 3.2 or prior. Because the older Spark write timestamp with local timezone, no need to read them with UTC timezone. Otherwise, an incorrect value of timestamp occurs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug for Orc timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nOrc timestamp ntz is a new feature not release yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn yarn-client mode, `Client.appId` variable is not assigned, it is always `null`,  in cluster mode, this variable will be assigned to the true value. In this patch, we assign true application id to `appId` too.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor client mode, it directly call submitApplication and return appId to YarnClientSchedulerBackend.buildtoYarn(). So for client mode, we only can assign ApplicationId to appId in submitApplication. Then since this value is assigned. so We don't need to add a new variable appId in `createContainerLaunchContext()`. and don need assign `this.appId` in `run()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Refactor the code to avoid define `appId` three tines in each function, we can just use this private variable.\r\n2. In client mode, user can use this value to get the application id in their internal code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManuel tested.\r\n\r\nWe have a internal proxy server to replace yarn tracking url, here use `appId`, with this patch it's not null.\r\n\r\n```\r\n21/11/26 12:38:44 INFO Client:\r\n\t

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the boolean option 'useRawQuery' to unwrap the query from 'select' statement, used to get schema, as it causes problems with CTE when using MSSQL JDBC driver. When set to 'true', the user has to also provide a schema of result in 'customSchema' option. The obvious downside of this approach is that the user is obligated to fetch schema beforehand when running the query. The advantage is that we are avoiding running query twice just to get schema, and users can run query without modification, unlike the solution described in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34693\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are needed to support of CTE while using MSSQL JDBC\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded optiont 'useRawQuery' to JDBC options. Example:\r\n```\r\nJdbcMsSqlDF = (\r\n    spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n    .option(\"url\", f\"jdbc:sqlserver://{server}:{port};databaseName={database};\")\r\n    .option(\"user\", user)\r\n    .option(\"password\", password)\r\n    .option(\"useRawQuery\", \"true\")  //<----------- Do not wrap the query\r\n    .option(\"customSchema\", schema)\r\n    .option(\"driver\", \"com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver\")\r\n    .option(\"query\", query)\r\n    .load()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested manually, unit tests

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET LOCATION` to use v2 command by default.\r\n\r\nNote that the work to make v1/v2 commands consistent was done in #34686 and tests covering both v1/v2 were done in #34610.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the logic on ForeachBatchSink to remove unnecessary SerializeFromObject, via leveraging LogicalRDD instead of ExternalRDD.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings slight performance gain as Spark no longer does unnecessary serde on foreachBatch. In addition, the logic is simpler as we defer the encoding logic to the Dataset.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT, and new UTs.","created_at":"2021-11-25T03:23:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T08:01:44Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T08:00:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b5e4d7ea1b1165e04785082aa6c280f6e4140f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nv2 `CREATE NAMESPACE` command currently doesn't qualify the location property whereas v1 command qualifies it. This PR proposes to make the behavior consistent by qualifying the location property for v2 command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the behavior consistent b/w v1 and v2 command, but not qualifying the location property seems like a bug since the default filesystem can change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the location property will be qualified before it is passed to v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new test.","created_at":"2021-11-25T01:48:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T09:03:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-25T07:25:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"859cdae360602ca9c024a9cf0504419e028388a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27a3a2d1cfc26bcc12febcfc4f43a1a84aaa3d63","head":{"label":"imback82:create_ns_qualify_loc","ref":"create_ns_qualify_loc","sha":"27a3a2d1cfc26bcc12febcfc4f43a1a84aaa3d63","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the query plan, if the child of hash aggregate is already sorted on group-by columns, we can replace hash aggregate with sort aggregate for better performance, as sort aggregate does not have hashing overhead of hash aggregate. Add a physical plan rule `ReplaceHashWithSortAgg` here, and can be disabled by config `spark.sql.execution.replaceHashWithSortAgg`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to help review as this PR triggers several TPCDS plan files change. The files below are having the real code change:\r\n\r\n* `SQLConf.scala`\r\n* `QueryExecution.scala`\r\n* `ReplaceHashWithSortAgg.scala`\r\n* `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala`\r\n* `HashAggregateExec.scala`\r\n* `ReplaceHashWithSortAggSuite.scala`\r\n* `SQLMetricsSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo get better query performance by leveraging sort ordering in query plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `ReplaceHashWithSortAggSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-11-24T23:43:49Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T07:36:12Z","closed_at":"2021-12-03T13:17:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81e853ef3d394354c85b555c039ce0dbc2d0e478","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ce7d279cec23d3bc50c8d6f870a10b11395523c","head":{"label":"c21:agg-rule","ref":"agg-rule","sha":"8ce7d279cec23d3bc50c8d6f870a10b11395523c","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes an optimization rule to prune unnecessary fields from `Generate` for some cases, e.g. under count-only `Aggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs shown in the JIRA, if a query counts nested elements (structs) on an array by exploding the array in `Generate`, because there is no particular nested field is specified, Spark currently reads the full nested struct without any pruning, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [count(1) AS count(true)#20299L]\r\n+- Project\r\n   +- Generate explode(items#20293), [0], false, [item#20296]\r\n      +- Filter ((size(items#20293, true) > 0) AND isnotnull(items#20293))\r\n         +- Relation default.table[items#20293] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn optimization can be made to pick up arbitrary nested field from the struct. So we can prune unnecessary field access and still count the number of array elements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2021-11-24T23:19:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T17:13:21Z","closed_at":"2021-12-02T17:13:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d1b555d8589fa5ae6024e940a02b7584fcfcb8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12e65284e45d7e7c05cef881b6da3a154da274d5","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-37450","ref":"SPARK-37450","sha":"12e65284e45d7e7c05cef881b6da3a154da274d5","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to explicitly set the date pattern to `yyyy-MM-dd` while inferring types of partition values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing date partition parser is much more tolerant to its input, and can skip some parts of date strings. For example, see SPARK-36861. As a consequence, it can loose some user's info (pieces of partition values).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. New behaviour introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33709 hasn't released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe will store table schema in table properties for the read-side to restore. In Spark 3.1, we add char/varchar support natively. In some commands like `create table`, `alter table` with these types,  the `char(x)` or `varchar(x)` will be stored directly to those properties. If a user uses Spark 2 to read such a table it will fail to parse the schema.\r\n\r\nFYI, https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/DataType.scala#L136\r\n\r\nA table can be a newly created one by Spark 3.1 and later or an existing one modified by Spark 3.1 and on.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbackward compatibility\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThat's not necessarily user-facing as a bugfix and only related to internal table properties.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr continue the work of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29247 since origin author didn't reply for a long time.\r\nWill add as co-author.\r\n\r\nFor the whole process of application, user may want to know each executor's peak memory usage to see the Resource utilization. The distribution of all executor's peak memory metrics usage  can help users know whether or not there is a skew/bottleneck among executor resource utilization in a given stage.\r\n\r\nWe define `activeOnly` and `quantiles` query parameter in the REST API for all executors peak memory metrics distribution:\r\n```\r\napplications/<application_id>/<application_attempt/executorPeakMemoryMetricsDistribution?activeOnly=[true (default) | false]&quantiles=0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95\r\n```\r\n1. withSummaries: default is false, define whether to show current stage's taskMetricsDistribution and executorMetricsDistribution\r\n2. quantiles: default is `0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0` only effect when `withSummaries=true`, it define the quantiles we use when calculating metrics distributions.\r\n\r\nWhen withSummaries=true, both task metrics in percentile distribution and executor metrics in percentile distribution are included in the REST API output.  The default value of withSummaries is false, i.e. no metrics percentile distribution will be included in the REST API output.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAlways user care about  executor peak usage distribution, this pr help users understand executor peak memory metrics distributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use below restful API to get all executor's peak memory metrics distribution:\r\n```\r\napplications/<application_id>/<application_attempt>/executorPeakMemoryMetricsDistribution\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<img width=\"944\" alt=\"截屏2022-01-07

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently CTE queries from Spark are not supported with MSSQL server via JDBC. This is because MSSQL server doesn't support the nested CTE syntax (`SELECT * FROM (WITH t AS (...) SELECT ... FROM t) WHERE 1=0`) that Spark builds from the original query (`options.tableOrQuery`) in `JDBCRDD.resolveTable()`  and in `JDBCRDD.compute()`.\r\nUnfortunately, it is non-trivial to split an arbitrary query it into \"with\" and \"regular\" clauses in `MsSqlServerDialect`. So instead, I'm proposing a new general JDBC option \"withClause\" that users can use if they have complex queries with CTE:\r\n```\r\nval withClause = \"WITH t AS (SELECT x, y FROM tbl)\"\r\nval query = \"SELECT * FROM t WHERE x > 10\"\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n  .option(\"url\", jdbcUrl)\r\n  .option(\"withClause\", withClause)\r\n  .option(\"query\", query)\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\nThis change also works with MSSQL's temp table syntax:\r\n```\r\nval withClause = \"(SELECT * INTO #TempTable FROM (SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE x > 10) t)\"\r\nval query = \"SELECT * FROM #TempTable\"\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n  .option(\"url\", jdbcUrl)\r\n  .option(\"withClause\", withClause)\r\n  .option(\"query\", query)\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support CTE queries with MSSQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, CTE queries are supported form now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new integration UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-23T12:09:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T12:58:41Z","closed_at":"2022-03-14T00:17:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d80230de2b525720f151de36db05bfe652e960e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b53ef475b6349e351e74635c1b1e5d4a923398fb","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-37259-cte-mssql","ref":"SPARK-37259-cte-mssql","sha":"b53ef475b6349e351e74635c1b1e5d4a923398fb","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds caching to `LogicalPlan.isStreaming()`: the default implementation's result will now be cached in a `private lazy val`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves the performance of the `DeduplicateRelations` analyzer rule.\r\n\r\nThe default implementation of `isStreaming` recursively visits every node in the tree. `DeduplicateRelations.renewDuplicatedRelations` is recursively invoked on every node in the tree and each invocation calls `isStreaming`. This leads to `O(n^2)` invocations of `isStreaming` on leaf nodes.\r\n\r\nCaching `isStreaming` avoids this performance problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorrectness should be covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\nThis significantly improved `DeduplicateRelations` performance in local microbenchmarking with large query plans (~20% reduction in that rule's runtime in one of my tests).","created_at":"2021-11-23T08:24:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T08:46:39Z","closed_at":"2021-11-29T08:46:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"357a17d673118a33c07d7894444011fe272794b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c393a586b2a172c0138eeacf7552d8561157af4","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:cache-LogicalPlan.isStreaming","ref":"cache-LogicalPlan.isStreaming","sha":"0c393a586b2a172c0138eeacf7552d8561157af4","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince Hive 2.3.9  start have function `getWithoutRegisterFns`, but user may use hive 2.3.8 or lower version.\r\nHere we should use reflection to let user build with hive 2.3.8 or lower version\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport build with hive version lower than 2.3.9 since many user will build spark with it 's own hive code and their own jar (they may do some optimize or. other thing in their own code). This pr make it easier to integrate and won't hurt current logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can build spark with hive version lower than 2.3.9\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nbuild with command \r\n```\r\n./dev/make-distribution.sh --tgz -Pyarn -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Dhive.version=2.3.8\r\n```\r\n\r\nJars under

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to replace Python's built-in CPickle to CPickle-based cloudpickle (requires Python 3.8+).\r\nFor Python 3.7 and below, it still uses the legacy built-in CPickle for the performance matter.\r\n\r\nI did a bit of benchmark with basic cases, and I have seen no performance penalty (attached one of the benchmarks below).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo remove named tuple hack for the issues such as: SPARK-32079,  SPARK-22674 and SPARK-27810.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Micro benchmark:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\nimport pickle\r\nfrom pyspark import cloudpickle\r\n\r\ndef measure(f):\r\n

which is covered by `self.assert_eq(pser.astype(str), psser.astype(str))`.\r\n- **Add null value process in rpow**, which is covered by `def test_rpow(self)`\r\n- **Add index_ops.hasnans in `astype`**, which is covered by `test_astype`.\r\n\r\nThis patch also move `numeric_w_nan_pdf` into `numeric_pdf`, that means all float_nan/decimal_nan separated test case have been cleaned up and merged into numeric test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFollow the pandas behavior\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, correct the null value result to follow the pandas behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. ut to cover all changes\r\n2.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, there is an inconsistency when handling an empty location for `ALTER NAMESPACE .. SET LOCATION` between v1 and v2 command. In v1 command, an empty string location will result in the `IllegalArgumentException` exception thrown whereas v2 uses the empty string as it is.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the behavior consistent by following the v1 command behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the behavior consistent and the reason for following v1 behavior is that \"Spark should be responsible to qualify the user-specified path using its spark/hadoop configs, before passing the path to v2 sources\": https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34610#discussion_r754028045\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the empty string location will result in the `IllegalArgumentException` exception thrown even for v2 catalogs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvides a profiler for Python/Pandas UDFs.\r\n\r\nAs each profiler is connected to the `PythonUDF.resultId`, the query plan will show the

add2(x):\r\n...   return x + 2\r\n...\r\n>>> added = df.select(add1(\"id\"), add2(\"id\"), add1(\"id\"))\r\n\r\n>>>

`add1(...)#4L` of `BatchEvalPython`.\r\n\r\n**Currently registered UDFs are not supported.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently a profiler is provided for only `RDD` operations, but providing a profiler for Python/Pandas UDFs would be great.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the profiler for Python/Pandas UDFs will work and show the results when a Spark conf `spark.python.profile` is set to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some tests and manually checked the behavior.","created_at":"2021-11-22T23:33:32Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T05:38:02Z","closed_at":"2021-11-29T05:38:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db73e51adf928a40c5d134cdabb3f221adefb61d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a2a31322bb43845bf530182cde769f0d89f825b","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-37443/profiler","ref":"issues/SPARK-37443/profiler","sha":"0a2a31322bb43845bf530182cde769f0d89f825b","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDon't say underlying column buffers of InMemoryRelation are materialized until all partitions of the RDD have completed by checking status through BlockManagerMaster\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when `CachedRDDBuilder.buildBuffers` is called, `InMemoryRelation.computeStats` will try to read the accumulators to determine what the relation size is. However, the accumulators are not actually accurate until the cachedRDD is executed and finishes. While this has not happened, the accumulators will report a range from 0 bytes to the accumulator value when the cachedRDD finishes. In AQE, join planning can happen during this time and, if it reads the size as 0 bytes, will likely plan a broadcast join mistakenly believing the build side is very small. If the InMemoryRelation is actually very large in size, then this will cause many issues during execution such as job failure due to broadcasting over 8GB.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUnder ANSI mode(spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true), the function invocation of Spark SQL:\r\n\r\n- In general, it follows the `Store assignment` rules as storing the input values as the declared parameter type of the SQL functions\r\n- Special rules apply for string literals and untyped NULL. A NULL can be promoted to any other type, while a string literal can be promoted to any simple data type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the ANSI SQL mode resolves the function invocation with `Least Common Type Resolution` based on`Type precedence list`. After a closer look at the ANSI SQL standard, the \"store assignment\" syntax rules should be used for resolving the type coercion between the input and parameters of SQL function, while the `Type precedence list` is used for \"Subject routine determination\"(SQL function overloads).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/142833343-25151c1b-ccda-407c-a831-6b6ec4cf642f.png)\r\n\r\nI have also done some data science among real-world SQL queries, the following implicit function casts are not allowed as per `Least Common Type Resolution` but they are commonly seen:\r\n\r\n- Numeric/Date/Timestamp => String, e.g. tableau generated query `CONCAT(DATE_ADD(%1, CAST(%2 AS INT)), SUBSTR(CAST(%1 AS TIMESTAMP), 11)) AS TIMESTAMP)`\r\n- Timestamp => Date, e.g `date_sub(now(), 7) < ...`\r\n- Double => Long, e.g.  `from_unixtime(updated/1000)`, note that `updated` and `1000` will be converted as Double first.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR is ANSI compatible and it is good for the adoption of ANSI SQL mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Use store assignment rules for resolving function invocation under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use [Python's standard string formatter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting) instead of hacky custom SQL parser for SQL API in pandas API on Spark\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of parsing is very hacky, and does not work. It is [dependent on Python's internal module](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/sql_processor.py#L291), and [Series is being treated as a table](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/sql_processor.py#L339-L340), etc.\r\n\r\nWe should have the Python standard string formatter with the standard interface and the standard support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Disallowed:**\r\n\r\n1. `Series` as a table\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    myser = ps.Series({'a': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 'b': [15.0, 30.0, 45.0]})\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT * from {myser}\", myser=myser)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. `list` and `range`\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    strs = ['a', 'b']\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT 'a' IN {strs}\", strs=strs)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Automatic local/global variable detection:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    strs = ['a', 'b']\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT 'a' IN {strs}\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Allowed:**\r\n\r\n1. `Series` as a column\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = ps.range(10)\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT {ser} FROM {mydf}\", ser=mydf.id, mydf=mydf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Reference checking (between `Series` and `DataFrame`)\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = ps.range(10)\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT {ser} FROM tblA\", ser=mydf.id)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ValueError: The series in {ser} does not refer any dataframe specified.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Attribute supports from frame (standard Python support):\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = ps.range(10)\r\n    ps.sql(\"SELECT {tbl.id} FROM {tbl}\", tbl=mydf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoctests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-37272  and SPARK-37282,  we can manually add\r\n\r\n```\r\n-Dtest.exclude.tags=org.apache.spark.tags.ExtendedLevelDBTest,org.apache.spark.tags.ExtendedRocksDBTest \r\n```\r\nwhen run `mvn test` or `sbt test` to disable unsupported UTs on MacOs using Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\nThis pr add a new profile to re-write `test.default.exclude.tags` property and  activate it automatically when build on MacOs using Apple Silicon to simplify execution commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify test commands on MacOs using Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Run the tests on M1, there are 3 modules with `Extended{LevelDB,RocksDB}Test` annotation: `core`,`sql`, `yarn`\r\n 1. For maven, we can use follow commands to test the effectiveness of the current pr:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTest -pl ${moduleName} [-Pyarn]\r\nmvn test -pl ${moduleName} [-Pyarn]\r\n```\r\n 2. For sbt, we can use follow commands to test the effectiveness of the current pr:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"${moduleName}/test\" [-Pyarn]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the this PR, when testing with MacOs using

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCalling `timeZoneId.get` on Option[String] leads to `NoSuchElementException: None.get`. This PR matches the value of Option[String] and uses `TimeZone.getDefault.toZoneId` when zoneId is None, this avoid unexpected exceptions to users. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCalling `.get` on Option variable never been a good idea. We can either use a default value or choose to throw a meaningful exception. In this case, TimeZone.getDefault will be a good fit for a default value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested Locally and via Unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `_shared_params_code_gen.py ` to include type hints in generated code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it applies minor cleanup:\r\n\r\n- Switch from manual replace to string interpolation.\r\n- Added magic commas for consistent formatting of the `shared` list.\r\n- Dropped unused arguments from `_gen_param_code`\r\n- Added to type hints to `_gen_param_header` and `_gen_param_code` and dropped `_shared_params_code_gen.pyi` stub.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCore change is part of the bigger effort to migrate hints from stub files to corresponding Python modules\r\n\r\n> Currently, we use stub files for type annotations, which don't support type checks within function bodies. So we inline type hints to support that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPropose to skip registering with ESS if a customized shuffle manager (Remote Shuffle Service) is configured. Otherwise, when the dynamic allocation is enabled without an external shuffle service in place, the Spark executor still tries to connect to the external shuffle service which gets to a connection refused exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo get dynamic allocation works with a 3rd party remote shuffle service.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest locally on K8s with docker-desktop, DA enabled, no external shuffle service, running Uber's RSS locally.\r\n\r\nWith the default setting, when I run spark job and it will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n> 21/11/30 07:35:24 INFO BlockManager: Registering executor with local external shuffle service.                                                                                              \r\n21/11/30 07:35:24 ERROR BlockManager: Failed to connect to external shuffle server, will retry 2 more times after waiting 5 seconds...\r\njava.io.IOException: Failed to connect to /10.1.2.201:7337\r\n\r\nThen apply this patch to Spark, rebuild Spark, and make the changes like the following in the ShuffleManager implementation, i.e `RssShuffleManager.scala`\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/RssShuffleManager.scala

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a `NullPointerException` in `WholeStageCodegenExec` caused by the expression `WidthBucket`. The cause of this NPE is that `WidthBucket` calls `WidthBucket.computeBucketNumber`, which can return `null`, but the generated code cannot deal with `null`s.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a `NullPointerException` in Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests to `MathExpressionsSuite`. This suite already had tests for `WidthBucket` with interval inputs, but lacked tests with double inputs.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `default` (`None`) value to `getattr(app, add_javascript)`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent logic fails on `getattr(app, \"add_javascript\")` when executed with Sphinx 4.x. The problem can be illustrated with a simple snippet.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> class Sphinx:\r\n...     def add_js_file(self, filename: str, priority: int = 500, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ...\r\n... \r\n>>> app = Sphinx()\r\n>>> getattr(app, \"add_js_file\", getattr(app, \"add_javascript\"))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-11-442ab6dfc933>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    getattr(app, \"add_js_file\", getattr(app, \"add_javascript\"))\r\nAttributeError: 'Sphinx' object has no attribute 'add_javascript'\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR is merged we'll fallback to `getattr(app, \"add_js_file\")`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> getattr(app, \"add_js_file\", getattr(app, \"add_javascript\", None))\r\n<bound method Sphinx.add_js_file of <__main__.Sphinx object at 0x7f444456abe0>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManual docs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Migrate `SHOW TBLPROPERTIES` to use V2 command by default\r\n2. Sort the result of V1 command of `SHOW TBLPROPERTIES`\r\n3. handle the `output == 1` case for V2 command to match V1 behavior\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands, and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFor use V2 command: \r\nif LEGACY_KEEP_COMMAND_OUTPUT_SCHEMA == true\r\nchange output `Row(\"key\", \"value\")` =>  `Row(\"value\")`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe only overhead `OptimizeSkewedJoin` may introduce is extra shuffles. We don't need to run the cost evaluator, which can be customized and may be expensive to run.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `OptimizeSkewedJoin` to use `ValidateRequirements` to detect extra shuffles.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nlogic simplification\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

In particular, this introduces the following changes:\r\n1. Added a new class `ParquetColumnVector` which encapsulates all the necessary information needed when reading a Parquet column, including the `ParquetColumn` for the Parquet column, the repetition & definition levels (only allocated for a leaf-node of a complex type), as well as the reader for the column. In addition, it also contains logic for assembling nested columnar batches, via interpreting Parquet repetition & definition levels. \r\n2. Changes are made in `VectorizedParquetRecordReader` to initialize a list of `ParquetColumnVector` for the columns read.\r\n3. `VectorizedColumnReader` now also creates a reader for repetition column. Depending on whether maximum repetition level is 0, the batch read is now split into two code paths, e.g., `readBatch` versus `readBatchNested`.\r\n4. Added logic to handle complex type in `VectorizedRleValuesReader`. For data types involving only struct or primitive types, it still goes with the old `readBatch` method which now also saves definition levels into a vector for later assembly. Otherwise, for data types involving array or map, a separate code path `readBatchNested` is introduced to handle repetition levels.\r\nThis PR also introduced a new flag `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` which turns the feature on or off. By default it is on to facilitates all the Parquet related test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhenever read schema containing complex types, at the moment Spark will fallback to the row-based reader in parquet-mr, which is much slower. As benchmark shows, by adding support into the vectorized reader, we can get ~15x on average speed up on reading struct fields, and ~1.5x when reading array of struct and map.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the PR Spark should now support reading complex types in its vectorized Parquet reader. A new config `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` is introduced to turn the feature on or off.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests.","created_at":"2021-11-19T02:30:35Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T23:19:27Z","closed_at":"2022-04-02T02:10:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1fcaa6a9f1c278eb05ce8ca3799a1eb44eca445","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91da32d88b971c5e9deca3bcf35e41de2beda3a7","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-34863-new","ref":"SPARK-34863-new","sha":"91da32d88b971c5e9deca3bcf35e41de2beda3a7","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tree pattern pruning to the `CTESubstitution` analyzer rule. The rule will now exit early if the tree does not contain an `UnresolvedWith` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAnalysis is eagerly performed after every DataFrame transformation. If a user's program performs a long chain of _n_ transformations to construct a large query plan then this can lead to _O(n^2)_ performance costs from `CTESubstitution` because it is applied _n_ times and each application traverses the entire logical plan tree (which contains _O(n)_ nodes). In the case of chained `withColumn` calls (leading to stacked `Project` nodes) it's possible to see _O(n^3)_ slowdowns where _n_ is the number of projects: this is because there are _n_ separate analysis phases, each of which calls `CTESubstitution.traverseAndSubstituteCTE`, where each call visits each of the _n_ `Project` nodes and each of their _O(n)_ expressions.\r\n\r\nVery large DataFrame plans typically do not use CTEs because there is not a DataFrame syntax for them (although they might appear in the plan if `sql(someQueryWithCTE)` is used). As a result, this PR's proposed optimization to skip `CTESubstitution` can greatly reduce the analysis cost for such plans.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI believe that optimizer correctness is covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\nAs a toy benchmark, I ran\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.RuleExecutor.resetMetrics() \r\n(1 to 600).foldLeft(spark.range(100).toDF)((df: DataFrame, i: Int) => df.withColumn(s\"col$i\", $\"id\" % i))\r\nprintln(org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.rules.RuleExecutor.dumpTimeSpent())\r\n```\r\n\r\non my laptop before and after this PR's changes (simulating a _O(n^3)_ case). Skipping `CTESubstitution` cut the running time from ~28.4 seconds to ~15.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the remaining time comes from `DeduplicateRelations`, for which I plan to submit a separate optimization PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce TimedeltaIndex to pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nProperties, functions, and basic operations of TimedeltaIndex will be supported in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\nPlease note that PySpark DayTimeIntervalType follows python datetime.timedelta, in which the smallest time unit is `microsecond`. However, pandas TimedeltaIndex has `nanosecond` support. \r\nThus, we may observe the inconsistency as below:\r\n```py\r\n>>> pidx = pd.TimedeltaIndex([1])\r\n>>> pidx\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['0 days 00:00:00.000000001'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n>>> ps.from_pandas(pidx)\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['0 days'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo inspect further in PySpark side:\r\n```py\r\n>>> pdf  # nanosecond\r\n          __index_level_0__\r\n0 0 days 00:00:00.000000001\r\n\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)\r\n\r\n>>> sdf.show(2, False)\r\n+-----------------------------------+\r\n|__index_level_0__                  |\r\n+-----------------------------------+\r\n|INTERVAL '0 00:00:00' DAY TO SECOND|\r\n+-----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince DayTimeIntervalType is supported in PySpark, we may add TimedeltaIndex support in pandas API on Spark accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n```py\r\n# TimedeltaIndex is introduced\r\n>>> ps.TimedeltaIndex([timedelta(1)])\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['1 days'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n>>> ps.TimedeltaIndex([timedelta(seconds=1)])\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['0 days 00:00:01'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n>>> ps.from_pandas(pd.TimedeltaIndex([timedelta(seconds=1)]))\r\nTimedeltaIndex(['0 days 00:00:01'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# timedelta64 Series/DataFrame is also supported as a consequence\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame({'td': [timedelta(hours=1, minutes=30)]})\r\n               td\r\n0 0 days 01:30:00\r\n>>> ps.Series([timedelta(hours=1, minutes=30)])\r\n0   0 days 01:30:00\r\ndtype: timedelta64[ns]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2021-11-19T01:02:37Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T09:26:07Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T09:21:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34180f05d110872e4635fa2aca58c0163379869d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f00fe78e846d157648b1ca5d7d1b9b83d8b1fd9","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:timedeltaindex","ref":"timedeltaindex","sha":"5f00fe78e846d157648b1ca5d7d1b9b83d8b1fd9","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new V2 min-in `HasPartitionKey` which can be used to return the partition value(s) of a `InputPartition`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs part of the Storage Partitioned Join work ([SPIP](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37166)), we'll need to introduce a way for a V2 `InputPartition` to return its partition values, which can then be used to compare whether both sides of a join operator can be considered \"compatible\" and thus allows Spark to eliminate shuffle. The info will also be used to group input partitions.\r\n\r\nThis will be used later in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a new V2 mix-in `HasPartitionKey` will be introduced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExtended `InMemoryTable` to support this new interface, and added a new unit test to verify the API.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-19T00:56:53Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T18:49:33Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T05:30:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e859bf007066bfd531ef95550745a4b4128046c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b920e1e3109d6f2c37150cb2ffd168790a35d3e","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-37376","ref":"SPARK-37376","sha":"6b920e1e3109d6f2c37150cb2ffd168790a35d3e","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a small number of tweaks to our Python lint infra.\r\n\r\n* pylintrc is obsolete and not used.\r\n* tox.ini supports multiline values, so I've broken up the extremely long lines that were in there.\r\n* A requirement was missing from requirements.txt so I added it in there.\r\n* I've removed pycodestyle and merged its configs into flake8's, since flake8 includes pycodestyle checks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGeneral maintenance of our internal Python infra.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing `dev/lint-python` script.","created_at":"2021-11-19T00:24:22Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T15:30:10Z","closed_at":"2021-11-23T23:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48967243f487698253a012ae0f10259dfb5ae408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5418ec5d186b0192dc796226937e059ea8566a24","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-37380-python-lint-infra","ref":"SPARK-37380-python-lint-infra","sha":"5418ec5d186b0192dc796226937e059ea8566a24","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of #34502 to address post-reviews. \r\n\r\nThis PR rewords on the explanation on performance tune on RocksDB state store to make it less confused, and also fix the method docs to be in sync with the code changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. The explanation on performance tune on RocksDB state store was unclear in a couple of spots.\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCollecting `LocalSparkContext` worker logs in case of test failure. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAbout 50 test suites are using `LocalSparkContext` by specifying \"local-cluster\" as the cluster URL. In this case executor logs will be under the worker dir which is a temporary directory and as such will be deleted at shutdown (for details see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0a4961df29aab6912492e87e4e719865fe20d981/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/LocalSparkCluster.scala#L70).\r\n\r\nSo when such a test fails and the error was on the executor side the log will be lost.\r\n\r\nThis is only for local cluster tests and not for standalone tests where logs will be kept in the \"<SPARK_HOME>/work\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by adding a temporary code to one of the test to fail then checked the unittest.log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n21/11/18 18:59:32.924 dag-scheduler-event-loop INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Killing all running tasks in stage 0: Stage finished\r\n21/11/18 18:59:32.924

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKeep track of and communicate to the listener bus how long we are waiting for execs to be allocated from the underlying cluster manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSometimes the cluster manager may choke or otherwise not be able to allocate resources and we don't have a good way of detecting this situation making it difficult for the user to debug and tell apart from Spark not scaling up correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew field in the listener bus message for when a executor is allocated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test in the listener

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo keep the build stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
