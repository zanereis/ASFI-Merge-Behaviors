SingleHopClientExecutorWithLoggingIntegrationTest fails intermittently\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 12 commits. The main commits to review are:\r\n- 88b353c: GEODE-2644: Make LogWriterAppender optional and support log4j2.xml\r\n- f115a59: GEODE-2644: Make AlertAppender optional and support log4j2.xml\r\n\r\nHigh level description of these changes:\r\n\r\n1. Follow log4j2 best practices\r\nMake the Geode appenders configurable from log4j2.xml and pausable so that we can delete the majority of manipulating log4j2 core code. Geode used to dynamically add/remove appenders, now we pause/resume appenders that remain registered. Also, use log4j2 core testing JUnit Rule for integration tests involving a log4j2.xml config file.\r\n\r\n2. Make log4j2 core dependency optional\r\nReplace direct manipulation of singletons from Geode code with a simple internal LoggingSession API that makes log4j2 core optional and makes Geode logging/alerting pluggable for other logging engines such as Logback.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-05T17:17:51Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T01:18:07Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T22:00:36Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T22:00:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"6691d310e1263966991e584f712156d919dabecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sboorlagadda","id":7171016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNzEwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7171016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda","html_url":"https://github.com/sboorlagadda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sboorlagadda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/2778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/2778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/d81b50fce29d986b2ff3ed7126436447b3dabf27","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-2644-Appenders-commits-03","ref":"GEODE-2644-Appenders-commits-03","sha":"d81b50fce29d986b2ff3ed7126436447b3dabf27","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58218609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIxODYwOQ==","name":"geode","full_name":"kirklund/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"http

basic problem with this code was that it was declaring an exception in one part of the code and later \"picking up\" that error and throwing it. This messed with the time and handling of errors as one might imagine... QueueManagerImpl.java was the source of that problem. Then there were timing issues in the DeltaPropogationDUnitTests themselves. So I alleviated that in part moving to awaitility and to the new GeodeAwaitility.

PR addresses the problem of AcceptorImpl sending out expensive\r\nprofile update messages when it's being stopped during Cache.close().\r\nThere is no reason to send these messages if the affected regions are\r\ngoing to be destroyed since that also sends profile updates\r\nto other members of the cluster.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes to the unit test class are to remove old \"ignored\" tests that didn't make any sense and to add a new test concerning the sending of profile updates.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

Added robustness of test cleanup by way of newer ClusterStarterRule and the removal of many statics\r\n* The actual test behavior should be unchanged, excepting the simplification\r\nof logic surrounding the potential of a dirty testing environment.\r\n* Parameterize test to run each test with 1, 3, and 5 dispatcher threads, rather than choosing one value at random.\r\n* Grouped methods for readability.\r\n* Additional refactoring is recommended to make use of the locator and server starter rules,\r\nrather than invoking custom creation in otherwise-empty VMs.\r\n* Address GEODE-5819
