partition object contain one or many replica objects. These replica\r\nobjects in turn can have the \"log\" if the replica corresponds to the\r\nlocal node. All the code in Partition or ReplicaManager peek into\r\nreplica object to fetch the log if they need to operate on that. As\r\nreplica object can represent a local replica or a remote one, this\r\nlead to a bunch of \"if-else\" code in log fetch and offset update code.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In addition to a \"log\" that is in use during normal operation, if\r\nan alter log directory command is issued, we also create a future log\r\nobject. This object catches up with local log and then we switch the log\r\ndirectory. So temporarily a Partition can have two local logs. Before\r\nthis change both logs are inside replica objects.\r\n\r\nThis change is an attempt to untangle this relationship. In particular\r\nit moves \"log\" from a replica object to Partition. So a partition contains\r\na local log to which all writes go. And it maintains a list of replica\r\nfor offset and \"caught up time\" data that it uses for replication\r\nprotocol. The replica correspoding to Local node contains a log object,\r\nbut the object is now read only and no code except Replica and test code\r\nuse it. Every other part of code in Partion and ReplicaManger use the\r\nlog object stored in Partition. This uncouples the replica-log relation\r\nand all the \"if-else\" code went away. Couple of more structural changes\r\nare made in this change:\r\n1. Two subclasses of Replica are introduced: LocalReplica and\r\nRemoteReplica. This makes it clear what each replica stores and is\r\ncapable of.\r\n2. The \"log\" in Partition is also wrapped in a LogInfo wrapper, which\r\nencapuslates all the code that either operated on \"log\" or maintained\r\nstate of it.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been updated to take care of change in heirarchy.\r\nTested by running multiple brokers and produced and consumed data. Also\r\nchanged log directory back and forth to make sure that alter log\r\ndirectory use case works.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

partition object contain one or many replica objects. These replica\r\nobjects in turn can have the \"log\" if the replica corresponds to the\r\nlocal node. All the code in Partition or ReplicaManager peek into\r\nreplica object to fetch the log if they need to operate on that. As\r\nreplica object can represent a local replica or a remote one, this\r\nlead to a bunch of \"if-else\" code in log fetch and offset update code.\r\n\r\nNOTE: In addition to a \"log\" that is in use during normal operation, if\r\nan alter log directory command is issued, we also create a future log\r\nobject. This object catches up with local log and then we switch the log\r\ndirectory. So temporarily a Partition can have two local logs. Before\r\nthis change both logs are inside replica objects.\r\n\r\nThis change is an attempt to untangle this relationship. In particular\r\nit moves \"log\" from a replica object to Partition. So a partition contains\r\na local log to which all writes go. And it maintains a list of replica\r\nfor offset and \"caught up time\" data that it uses for replication\r\nprotocol. The replica correspoding to Local node contains a log object,\r\nbut the object is now read only and no code except Replica and test code\r\nuse it. Every other part of code in Partion and ReplicaManger use the\r\nlog object stored in Partition. This uncouples the replica-log relation\r\nand all the \"if-else\" code went away. Couple of more structural changes\r\nare made in this change:\r\n1. Two subclasses of Replica are introduced: LocalReplica and\r\nRemoteReplica. This makes it clear what each replica stores and is\r\ncapable of.\r\n2. The \"log\" in Partition is also wrapped in a LogInfo wrapper, which\r\nencapuslates all the code that either operated on \"log\" or maintained\r\nstate of it.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been updated to take care of change in heirarchy.\r\nTested by running multiple brokers and produced and consumed data. Also\r\nchanged log directory back and forth to make sure that alter log\r\ndirectory use case works.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\nStarting a few days ago, Kafka integration tests started to fail, with the error \"Zookeeper node failed to start\". The reason is kafka-run-class.sh can't find java in the PATH. Further investigation shows it is caused by a breaking change in openjdk:8 docker image: https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/commit/3eb0351b208d739fac35345c85e3c6237c2114ec\r\n\r\nThe image no longer installs a symlink of java in standard path /usr/bin, but uses ENV directive to specify custom PATH. On the other hand, ducktape use Paramiko to SSH to other docker instances to start ZK, which doesn't source any bashrc, thus not able to find the java.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by using ForceCommand directive in sshd_config so that the environment variable is set even for Paramiko sessions.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* All brokers will handle FetchRequest regardless of leadership\r\n* Leaders can compute a preferred replica to return to the client\r\n* New ReplicaSelector interface for determining the preferred replica\r\n* Incremental fetches will include partitions with no records if the preferred replica has been computed\r\n* Adds new JMX to expose the current preferred read replica of a partition in the consumer\r\n\r\nTwo new conditions were added for completing a delayed fetch. They both relate to communicating the high watermark to followers without waiting for a timeout:\r\n* For regular fetches, if the high watermark changes within a single fetch request \r\n* For incremental fetch sessions, if the follower's high watermark is lower than the leader\r\n\r\nA new JMX attribute `preferred-read-replica` was added to the `kafka.consumer:type=consumer-fetch-manager-metrics,client-id=some-consumer,topic=my-topic,partition=0` object. This was added to support the new system test which verifies that the fetch from follower behavior works end-to-end. This attribute could also be useful in the future when debugging problems with the consumer.","created_at":"2019-05-28T21:14:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T15:18:52Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T15:18:52Z","merged_at":"2019-07-04T15:18:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"23beeea34bf9e5e7a33dc0566d54a17b2b417c0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6832/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6832/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6832/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4649c14a969cd8c88d06cad68f65d39a0cfdd905","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-8443","ref":"KAFKA-8443","sha":"4649c14a969cd8c88d06cad68f65d39a0cfdd905","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

the olden days, OffsetForLeaderEpoch was exclusively an inter-broker protocol and required Cluster level permission. With KIP-320, clients can use this API as well and so we lowered the required permission to Topic Describe. The only way the client can be sure that the new permissions are in use is to require version 3 of the protocol which was bumped for 2.3. If the broker does not support this version, we skip the validation and revert to the old behavior.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch fixes a problem with the newly added `replicaId` field when parsed from older versions which did not have it. If the field was not present, then we used the consumer's sentinel value, but this would limit the range of visible offsets by the high watermark. To get around this problem, this patch adds a separate \"debug\" sentinel similar to APIs like Fetch and ListOffsets.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

3.5.5 is the first stable release in the 3.5.x series. The key new feature\r\nin is TLS support, but there are a few more noteworthy features:\r\n\r\n* Dynamic reconfiguration\r\n* Local sessions\r\n* New node types: Container, TTL\r\n* Ability to remove watchers\r\n* Multi-threaded commit processor\r\n* Upgraded to Netty 4.1\r\n\r\nSee the release notes for more detail:\r\nhttps://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.5/releasenotes.html\r\n\r\nIn addition to the version bump, we:\r\n\r\n* Add `commons-cli` dependency as it's required by `ZooKeeperMain`, but specified as\r\n`provided` in their pom.\r\n* Remove unnecessary `ZooKeeperMainWrapper`, the bug it worked around was fixed\r\nupstream a long time ago.\r\n* Ignore non zero exit in one system test invocation of `ZooKeeperMain`.\r\n`ZooKeeperMainWrapper` always returned `0` and `ZooKeeperService.query` relies\r\non that for correct behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T22:00:04Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T16:45:16Z","closed_at":"2019-07-10T16:45:11Z","merged_at":"2019-07-10T16:45:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"d67495d6a7f4c5f7e8736a25d6a11a1c1bef8d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e276428fa0226db30681d4c33ffa86fead565d2b","head":{"label":"ijuma:zookeeper-3.5","ref":"zookeeper-3.5","sha":"e276428fa0226db30681d4c33ffa86fead565d2b","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

It is required to suggest a more meaningful message when `default.api.timeout.ms` that Timeout Exception could have occurred.\r\nThe 'default.api.timeout.ms' option coverage that was referenced by https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75974886\r\n\r\n2. It also needs to provide what stream thread was occurred of time out exception.\r\nso I augment the timeout Exception message on Stream Thread which includes Restore Consumer and Thread Consumer in run() method on Stream Thread Class.\r\n\r\nI`m wondering that the KAFKA 8311 merge request ticket is already written by  abbccdda \r\non https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6662\r\n \r\nI don`t know

of how config values are converted into strings in the `AbstractHerder.validateClientOverrides()` method after being validated by the client override policy, an exception is thrown if the value returned by the policy isn't already parsed as the type expected by the client `ConfigDef`. A more thorough writeup of how this happens is available in the linked Jira ticket.\r\n\r\nThe fix here involves parsing client override properties before passing them to the override policy.\r\n\r\nA unit test is added to ensure that several different types of configs are validated properly by the herder.\r\n\r\nThis bug fix should be included in the recently-cut 2.3 branch.\r\n\r\n### Committer

is inspired by the original work of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6699 by @Flowermin. It tries to achieve the same CPU savings by reducing unnecessary byte allocation and corresponding GC. Unlike #6699 though, which depends on `skipBytes` of LZ4 which used a shared byte array, in this PR we create a `skip buffer` outside of the compressed input stream. The reason is that not all compressed inputstream's implementation is optimized, more specifically:\r\n\r\n1. GZIP used BufferedInputStream, which has a shared buffer, sized 16KB\r\n2. SNAPPY used its own SnappyInputStream -> InputStream, which dynamically allocate\r\n3. LZ4 used its own KafkaLZ4BlockInputStream, which has a shared buffer of 64KB\r\n4. ZSTD used its own ZstdInputStream, but it's own overriden `skip` also dynamically allocate\r\n\r\nThe detailed implementation can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Add skipKeyValueIterator() into DefaultRecordBatch, used in LogValidator; also added PartialDefaultRecord which extends DefaultRecord.\r\n\r\n1.a. In order make this optimization really effective, we also need to refactor the LogValidator to refactor part of the validation per record into the outer loop so that we do not need to update inPlaceAssigment inside the loop any more. And then based on this boolean we can decide whether or not to use skipKeyValueIterator or not before the loop.\r\n\r\n1.b. Also used streaming iterator instead when skip-iterator cannot be used.\r\n\r\n2. With SkipKeyValueIterator, pre-allocate a skip byte array with fixed size (2KB), and use this array to take the decompressed bytes through each record, validating metadata and key / value / header size, while skipping the key / value bytes.\r\n\r\n3. Also tighten the unit tests of LogValidator to make sure scenarios like mismatched magic bytes / multiple batches per partition / discontinuous offsets / etc are indeed validated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

I've refactored the Subscription / Assignment such that: assigned partitions, error codes, and group instance id are not-final anymore, instead they can be updated.

commit allows a consumer and a producer to repopulate their cluster\r\nmetadata cache in case no nodes of currently cached are available.\r\n\r\nThis is useful in the following situation.\r\n1. A cluster was partially available (including some bootstrap nodes\r\nwere offline) when a client (a producer or consumer) was created.\r\n2. The client used the bootstrap list to get the list of available\r\ncluster nodes and cached this list in its metadata cache.\r\n3. All the nodes cached by the client (i.e., the nodes that were\r\navailable during the bootstrap) went offline.\r\n4. Nodes that were offline during the bootstrap became available.\r\n\r\nBefore this commit, the client was not able to discover nodes that had\r\nbecome available and could not continue working, despite the cluster was\r\nalive. This commit makes this possible by rerunning the bootstrapping\r\nprocess by the client.\r\n\r\nThis commit also tests this scenario by reproducing the situation with\r\na partially available cluster for a consumer and a producer and ensuring\r\nthey can operate normally (i.e., can consume and produce messages).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

versions of OpenJDK 11 do not properly handle external javadocs links referencing previous Java versions. See: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212233.\r\n\r\nFailure symptom:\r\n`> Task :connect:api:javadoc\r\njavadoc: error - The code being documented uses modules but the packages defined in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ are in the unnamed module.\r\n1 error`\r\n\r\nThis PR conditionally sets the Java api docs link for the affected Gradle tasks. I verified that the links render correctly in the generated documentation when building with `1.8.0_181` and `11.0.3`. For example, in `build/docs/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/source/SourceTask.html` the hyperlink to `java.nio.channels.Selector` points to a valid page on Oracle's site in both cases.\r\n\r\nNote that while the workaround is also applied to the `aggregatedJavadoc` task, this task was already failing for another, unrelated reason. There is some discussion in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6439. I validated the workaround locally by disabling the `:streams:test-utils:javadoc` task.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [
