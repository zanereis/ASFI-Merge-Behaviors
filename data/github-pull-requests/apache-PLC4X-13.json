issue where the jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if\nSafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when serializing HTML, newlines in elements descending from a pre tag were incorrectly skipped. That caused\nwhat should have been preformatted output to instead be a run of text.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1776\">jhy/jsoup#1776</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when pretty-print serializing HTML, newlines separating phrasing content (e.g. a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag within a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag\nwould be incorrectly skipped, instead of normalized to a space. Additionally, improved space normalization between\nother end of line occurences, and whitespace handling after a closing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1787\">jhy/jsoup#1787</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [2022-May-15]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[github.com/spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases\">github.com/spf13/cobra's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.5.0</h2>\n<h2>Spring 2022 Release 🌥️</h2>\n<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to another release of cobra. Completions continue to get better and better. This release adds a few really cool new features. We also continue to patch versions of our dependencies as they become available via dependabot. Happy coding!</p>\n<h2>Active help 👐🏼</h2>\n<p>Shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> for a big value add: Active Help <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1482\">spf13/cobra#1482</a>. With active help, a program can provide some inline warnings or hints for users as they hit tab. Now, your CLIs can be even more intuitive to use!</p>\n<p>Currently active help is only supported for bash V2 and zsh. Marc wrote a whole guide on how to do this, so make sure to give it a good read to learn how you can add this to your cobra code! <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/active_help.md\">https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/active_help.md</a></p>\n<h2>Group flags 🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑🏼</h2>\n<p>Cobra now has the ability to mark flags as required or exclusive as a <strong><em>group</em></strong>. Shout out to our newest maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/johnSchnake\"><code>@​johnSchnake</code></a> for this! <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1654\">spf13/cobra#1654</a> Let's say you have a <code>username</code> flag that <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> be partnered with a <code>password</code> flag. Well, now, you can enforce those as being required together:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>rootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&amp;u, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Username (required if password is set)&quot;)\nrootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&amp;pw, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Password (required if username is set)&quot;)\nrootCmd.MarkFlagsRequiredTogether(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flags may also be marked as &quot;mutally exclusive&quot; with the <code>MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive(string, string ... )</code> command API. Refer to our <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/user_guide.md\">user guide documentation</a> for further info!</p>\n<h2>Completions 👀</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add backwards-compatibility tests for legacyArgs() by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1547\">spf13/cobra#1547</a></li>\n<li>feat: Add how to load completions in your current zsh session by <a href=\"https://github.com/ondrejsika\"><code>@​ondrejsika</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1608\">spf13/cobra#1608</a></li>\n<li>Introduce FixedCompletions by <a href=\"https://github.com/emersion\"><code>@​emersion</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1574\">spf13/cobra#1574</a></li>\n<li>Add shell completion to flag groups by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1659\">spf13/cobra#1659</a></li>\n<li>Modify brew prefix path in macOS system by <a href=\"https://github.com/imxw\"><code>@​imxw</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1719\">spf13/cobra#1719</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): use backslash escape string expansion for tab by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1682\">spf13/cobra#1682</a></li>\n<li>style(bash-v2): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1681\">spf13/cobra#1681</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): standard completion optimizations by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1683\">spf13/cobra#1683</a></li>\n<li>style(bash): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1684\">spf13/cobra#1684</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): short-circuit descriptionless candidate lists by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1686\">spf13/cobra#1686</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering entries with descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1689\">spf13/cobra#1689</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering menu-complete descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1692\">spf13/cobra#1692</a></li>\n<li>fix(bash-v2): skip empty completions when filtering descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1691\">spf13/cobra#1691</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): read directly to COMPREPLY on descriptionless short circuit by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1700\">spf13/cobra#1700</a></li>\n<li>fix: Don't complete _command on zsh by <a href=\"https://github.com/twpayne\"><code>@​twpayne</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1690\">spf13/cobra#1690</a></li>\n<li>Improve fish_completions code quality by <a href=\"https://github.com/t29kida\"><code>@​t29kida</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1515\">spf13/cobra#1515</a></li>\n<li>Fix handling of descriptions for bash v3 by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1735\">spf13/cobra#1735</a></li>\n<li>undefined or nil Args default to ArbitraryArgs by <a href=\"https://github.com/umarcor\"><code>@​umarcor</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1612\">spf13/cobra#1612</a></li>\n<li>Add Command.SetContext by <a href=\"https://github.com/joshcarp\"><code>@​joshcarp</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1551\">spf13/cobra#1551</a></li>\n<li>Wrap printf tab with quotes by <a href=\"https://github.com/PapaCharlie\"><code>@​PapaCharlie</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1665\">spf13/cobra#1665</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation 📝</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed typos in completions docs -
