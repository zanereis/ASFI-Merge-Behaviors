href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html\">Gradle Module Metadata</a></h4>\n<p>The Gradle team has contributed a metadata file for Guava. If you use Gradle 6 or higher, you will see better handling of two kinds of dependency conflicts, plus another small feature related to our dependencies:</p>\n<h5>Selecting the appropriate flavor</h5>\n<p>When Gradle automatically selects the newest version of Guava in your dependency graph, it will now also select the appropriate flavor (<code>-android</code> or <code>-jre</code>) based on whether you project targets Android or not. For example, if you depend on 32.1.0-android and 30.0-jre, Gradle will select 32.1.0-jre. This is the version most likely to be compatible with all your dependencies.</p>\n<p>In the unusual event that you need to override Gradle's choice of flavor, you can do so as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>dependencies.constraints {\n  implementation(&quot;com.google.guava:guava&quot;) {\n    attributes {\n      attribute(\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.9.3 to 0.10.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.10.0</h2>\n<p>This release contains initial support for standalone packages and package renaming. Please see below for more details.</p>\n<p>We are also changing our release policy to better align with semver.</p>\n<h2>Support changes</h2>\n<p>This version of gopls contains changes to our release policy, deprecates support for some older Go versions, and deprecates support for several experimental features.</p>\n<h3>New release policy</h3>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/55267\">golang/go#55267</a>, we are tightening our release policy to better follow semver, increase stability, and reduce release-related toil. Significant new features will only be introduced in <code>*.*.0</code> patch versions, and subsequent patch releases will consist only of bugfixes. For example, this version (v0.10.0) introduces several new features, described below. Subsequent v0.10.* releases will contain only bugfixes.</p>\n<h3>Final support for Go 1.13-1.15</h3>\n<p>Consistent with the above release policy and our stated <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls#supported-go-versions-and-build-systems\">support window</a>, the <code>v0.10.*</code> minor version will be the final set of releases to support being used with Go 1.13-1.15. See <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/52982\">golang/go#52982</a> for details.</p>\n<p>Gopls will pop up a warning if it resolves a version of the <code>go</code> command that is older than 1.16. Starting with gopls@v0.11.0, gopls will cease to function when used with a <code>go</code> command with a version older than 1.16.</p>\n<h3>Deprecated experimental features</h3>\n<p>The following experimental features are deprecated, and will be removed in gopls@v0.11.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>experimentalWorkspaceModule</strong><code>golang/go#52897</code><code>go.work</code> files. See our <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/workspace.md#go-workspaces-go-118\">documentation</a> for information on how to use <code>go.work</code> files to work on multiple modules.</li>\n<li><strong>experimentalWatchedFileDelay</strong><code>golang/go#55268</code><code>workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles</code> notifications.</li>\n<li><strong>experimentalUseInvalidMetadata</strong><code>golang/go#54180</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>Support for &quot;standalone packages&quot;</h3>\n<p>Gopls now recognizes certain files as &quot;standalone main packages&quot;, meaning they should be interpreted as main packages consisting of a single file. To do this, gopls looks for packages named <code>main</code> containing a single build constraint that matches one of the tags configured by the new <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#standalonetags-string\"><code>standaloneTags</code></a> setting.</p>\n<p>This enables cross references and other features when working in a file such as the example below that contains a <code>//go:build ignore</code> build constraint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/197039428-72d78300-cbea-4abe-a408-e171991094b8.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h3>(preview) Support for package renaming</h3>\n<p><code>golang/go#41567</code><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/56184\">golang/go#56184</a>.</p>\n<p>To rename a package, initiate a rename request on the package clause of a file in the package:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/197041786-bf9e617c-9961-46ae-b21a-c240a18a3014.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>When this renaming is applied, gopls will adjust other package files accordingly, rename the package directory, and update import paths referencing the current package or any nested package in the renamed directory.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/197042160-e034e38d-3cd3-4c62-b912-747d8dc2f4ff.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h3>Method information in hover</h3>\n<p>Hovering over a type now shows a summary of its methods.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.9.1 to 0.9.3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.9.3</h2>\n<p><em>Move fast and fix things...</em><code>golang/go#54395</code></p>\n<p>As always, thank you for filing issues!</p>\n<h2>gopls/v0.9.2</h2>\n<p>This release contains many bug fixes, particularly related to problems that would require restarting gopls.</p>\n<p><strong>Note about network usage</strong>: among these fixes was a change to allow network usage when reloading the workspace. Reloading occurs when a <code>go.mod</code>, <code>go.sum</code>, or <code>go.work</code> file changes on disk. In the past, gopls would only allow network during the first workspace load. This resulted in confusing behavior when, for example, a new dependency is added to a <code>go.mod</code> file and gopls could not load it, but loading succeeded on restart.  See <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/54069\">#54069</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configuration changes</h2>\n<h3>directoryFilters at arbitrary depth</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#directoryfilters-string\"><code>&quot;directoryFilters&quot;</code></a> setting now supports excluding directories at arbitrary depth, using the <code>**</code> operator. (note that for v0.9.2, the default value for this setting is still <code>[&quot;-node_modules]&quot;</code>. In the next release, this will change to <code>[&quot;-**/node_modules&quot;]</code>).</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes and Performance improvements...</h2>\n<p>This release contains the following notable bug fixes / performance improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional change optimization</strong> - Following up on the work to optimize change processing from the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.9.0\">v0.9.0 release</a>, this release contains additional optimizations that result in around 50% faster change processing (measured via edits in the Kubernetes repo).</li>\n<li><strong>Fix for a long-standing memory leak</strong> - <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/53780\">#53780</a> fixed a long-standing bug that caused gopls to hold on to its initial state, gradually leaking memory as state changed during the editing session.</li>\n<li><strong>Fewer restarts</strong> - This release contains many fixes for cache-invalidation bugs that would cause gopls to get confused and require restarting. Additionally, see the note at top about enabling the network when reloading the workspace.  We believe we are close to our goal that restarting gopls should never be required to fix workspace errors. If you encounter such a bug, please file an issue!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full list of all issues fixed can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/274?closed=1\">gopls/v0.9.2 milestone</a>.\nTo report a new problem, please file a new issue at <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/new\">https://go.dev/issues/new</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thank you to our contributors!</h2>\n<p>Thank you for your contribution, <a href=\"https://github.com/alandonovan\"><code>@​alandonovan</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/antoineco\"><code>@​antoineco</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dle8\"><code>@​dle8</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/euroelessar\"><code>@​euroelessar</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hyangah\"><code>@​hyangah</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jamalc\"><code>@​jamalc</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mssdvd\"><code>@​mssdvd</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pjweinbgo\"><code>@​pjweinbgo</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rentziass\"><code>@​rentziass</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/suzmue\"><code>@​suzmue</code></a>!</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>The next planned gopls release is <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/278\">v0.10.0</a>.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.9.2</h2>\n<p>This release contains many bug fixes, particularly related to problems that would require restarting gopls.</p>\n<p><strong>Note about network usage</strong>: among these fixes was a change to allow network usage when reloading the workspace. Reloading occurs when a <code>go.mod</code>, <code>go.sum</code>, or <code>go.work</code> file changes on disk. In the past, gopls would only allow network during the first workspace load. This resulted in confusing behavior when, for example, a new dependency is added to a <code>go.mod</code> file and gopls could not load it, but loading succeeded on restart.  See <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/54069\">#54069</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>Configuration changes</h2>\n<h3>directoryFilters at arbitrary depth</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#directoryfilters-string\"><code>&quot;directoryFilters&quot;</code></a> setting now supports excluding directories at arbitrary depth, using the <code>**</code> operator. (note that for v0.9.2, the default value for this setting is still <code>[&quot;-node_modules]&quot;</code>. In the next release, this will change to <code>[&quot;-**/node_modules&quot;]</code>).</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes and Performance improvements...</h2>\n<p>This release contains the following notable bug fixes / performance improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Additional change optimization</strong> - Following up on the work to optimize change processing from the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.9.0\">v0.9.0 release</a>, this release contains additional optimizations that result in around 50% faster change processing (measured via edits in the Kubernetes repo).</li>\n<li><strong>Fix for a long-standing memory leak</strong> - <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/53780\">#53780</a> fixed a long-standing bug that caused gopls to hold on to its initial state, gradually leaking memory as state changed during the editing session.</li>\n<li><strong>Fewer restarts</strong> - This release contains many fixes for cache-invalidation bugs that would cause gopls to get confused and require restarting. Additionally, see the note at top about enabling the network when reloading the workspace.  We believe we are close to our goal that restarting gopls should never be required to fix workspace errors. If you encounter such a bug, please file an issue!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full list of all issues fixed can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/274?closed=1\">gopls/v0.9.2 milestone</a>.\nTo report a new problem, please file a new issue at <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/new\">https://go.dev/issues/new</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thank you to our contributors!</h2>\n<p>Thank you for your contribution, <a href=\"https://github.com/alandonovan\"><code>@​alandonovan</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/antoineco\"><code>@​antoineco</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dle8\"><code>@​dle8</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/euroelessar\"><code>@​euroelessar</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hyangah\"><code>@​hyangah</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jamalc\"><code>@​jamalc</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mssdvd\"><code>@​mssdvd</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pjweinbgo\"><code>@​pjweinbgo</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rentziass\"><code>@​rentziass</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/suzmue\"><code>@​suzmue</code></a>!</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>The next planned gopls release is <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/278\">v0.10.0</a>.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/244\">#244</a> Fix Maven plugin validation warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/239\">#239</a> Require Maven 3.2.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>Maven's <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/developers/compatibility-plan.html\">compatibility plan</a> marked Maven versions older than 3.2.5 as EOL in March 2023. Therefore, we now require 3.2.5 to move forward with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>The fixing of the validation warnings removed some Maven dependencies from the plugin's classpath (instead using the ones from Maven itself). I'm not aware of any negative consequences of this, but it's possible certain specialized use cases might encounter changes in behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/7ea236cc5256ce9801ded45080a0109c594dcf83\"><code>7ea236c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/f5d2014df98da9b06c0f0353f22fdfeb9043801e\"><code>f5d2014</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/250\">#250</a> from groovy/guava</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/b27275c4fce28293ec7075953056eb616b404efd\"><code>b27275c</code></a> Fix Guava CVEs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/3e50f9e115ccd9267f08a8562d8f8307ddbdeb87\"><code>3e50f9e</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/249\">#249</a> from groovy/remove_unneeded_dependencies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/01b3622c51ade4f4ed05c9c39e6d9e29d6f574df\"><code>01b3622</code></a> Remove overridden dependencies no longer needed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/473d93e30662008d81f352e721d99ca6300827cc\"><code>473d93e</code></a> Add test SLF4J implementation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/96da595bb00a4c551224ee9ef08f56d4887307c6\"><code>96da595</code></a> Update plugin-plugin configuration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/31259ae954da0e38dd2336fe5b26a25c25c86960\"><code>31259ae</code></a> Clean up integration test versions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/9c99c767ebf7e7f3c8bd079839a994ca400efe51\"><code>9c99c76</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/246\">#246</a> from hazendaz/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/commit/52187479d9819a5e767ae15b95fb47c167465a3c\"><code>5218747</code></a> Bump a couple integration test plugin versions</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/compare/2.1.0...3.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.codehaus.gmavenplus:gmavenplus-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.1.0&new-version=3.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls@v0.9.0</h2>\n<p>This release contains significant performance improvements (especially in incremental processing after source changes), bug fixes, and support for the LSP “<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/956\">inlay hints</a>” feature, along with several other minor enhancements.</p>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<p>Source edits cause gopls to invalidate and recompute information about the workspace, most of which has not changed. Previously, gopls would spend significant CPU copying data structures, sometimes more than 100ms per keystroke in a large workspace. This release includes many optimizations to avoid copying data needlessly, including a new <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/tools/+/gopls-release-branch.0.9:internal/persistent/map.go;l=26-37\">map representation</a> to achieve copying in constant time. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/euroelessar\"><code>@​euroelessar</code></a> for the design and implementation of this data structure.</p>\n<p>As a result of these improvements, gopls should be more responsive while typing in large codebases, though it will still use a lot of memory.</p>\n<p>Time to process a change notification in the Kubernetes repo:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/176967584-a8040048-6357-40d5-9d80-c448281f6482.png\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>Inlay hints</h3>\n<p>Added support for displaying inlay hints of composite literal field names and types, constant values, function parameter names, function type params, and short variable declarations. You can try these out in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/nightly.md\">vscode-go nightly</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#goinlayhintsassignvariabletypes\">enabling inlay hints settings</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/176967591-a7b767b3-d447-4691-9486-10f957dc9a0f.gif\" alt=\"image3\" /></p>\n<h3>Package References</h3>\n<p>Find references on <code>package foo</code> now lists locations where the given package is imported.</p>\n<h3>Quick-fix to add field names to struct literals</h3>\n<p>A new quick fix adds field names to struct literals with unkeyed fields.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57144380/176967261-6acbe0e7-7698-46ea-8deb-cbd913296034.gif\" alt=\"image1\" /></p>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<p>This release includes the following notable bugfixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes for goimports performance and correctness when using a go.work file (<a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/52784\">#52784</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix a crash during renaming in a package that uses generics (<a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/52940\">#52940</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix gopls getting confused when moving a file from the <code>foo_test</code> package to <code>foo</code> package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/45317\">#45317</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A full list of all issues fixed can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/260\">gopls/v0.9.0 milestone</a>.\nTo report a new problem, please file a new issue at <a href=\"https://go.dev/issues/new\">https://go.dev/issues/new</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thank you to our contributors!</h2>\n<p>Thank you for your contribution, <a href=\"https://github.com/alandonovan\"><code>@​alandonovan</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/euroelessar\"><code>@​euroelessar</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hyangah\"><code>@​hyangah</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jamalc\"><code>@​jamalc</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jba\"><code>@​jba</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/marwan-at-work\"><code>@​marwan-at-work</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/suzmue\"><code>@​suzmue</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/dle8\"><code>@​dle8</code></a>!</p>\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n<p>The next planned gopls release is <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/271\">v0.9.1</a>.

[29-Apr-2023]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.connect(url), natively support URLs with Unicode characters in the path or query string,\nwithout having to be escaped by the caller.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1914\">jhy/jsoup#1914</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: Calling Node.remove() on a node with no parent is now a no-op, vs a validation error.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1898\">jhy/jsoup#1898</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: aligned the HTML Tree Builder processing steps for AfterBody and AfterAfterBody to
